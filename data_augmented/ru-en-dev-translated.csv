24100	1	Ukraine takes the war beyond its borders to Russia. To give more money and weapons in the West
24100	3	The war caught up with them even there, in the house where they were hiding from the consequences of the special military operation (SVO) in the Kharkov region. The remnants of the Tochka U missiles, as the Investigative Committee of Russia reported, hit, as they say, on the squares and “three people were killed, two were missing, including one child, four civilians were injured, including one child, 39 private and 11 apartment buildings, one household was completely destroyed.”
24100	5	"The Investigative Committee of Russia initiated criminal cases under the articles ""Murder"" and ""Preparation for a crime and attempted crime."" But this news is scary. But there are two new main points that Ukraine has begun to actualize and will promote media and, of course, politically. To once again impress the West and traditionally beg him for money and weapons. Of course, to the ""war with Mordor."""
24100	7	Firstly, Ukraine not only does not want to accept Russia's conditions and stop hostilities, but also deliberately takes hostilities beyond its borders. The goal is one and terrible - to provoke Russia into more severe retaliatory strikes, to force it to leave the NVO regime and enter a full-fledged war.
24100	9	The calculation is as simple as it is vile, cynical and cruel: people have died, the Russian authorities need to somehow respond to this, and the neo-Nazi regime of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thinks it will be a war. If anything, he wants to provoke Russia into more brutal and powerful retaliatory strikes. For example, in the decision-making centers in Kyiv, where people have been getting used to living without alarm sirens for several days and feel quite comfortable, feeding in themselves a moronic-saving patriotism that suits neo-Nazis quite well.
24100	11	"Rockets fired at Kyiv will cause new bitterness among Ukrainians and help Kyiv justify itself for its unwillingness to give up and stop the senseless war, from which Ukraine, it is already known to the morons from the Office of the President (OPU), will never come out victorious. But there, in the OPU, it is not the hopes of ""feeding the youngsters"", but the hard calculation that Russia and the Russians will respond with their bitterness to the bitterness of Ukraine and Ukrainians. And this is already happening, and mutual bitterness is, whatever one may say, an excellent and natural background for the continuation of the war, and a natural motivation for mutual revenge on the battlefields and during shelling of cities and villages."
24100	13	In addition, this is the fulfillment of another order of the curators of the Kyiv regime. In the West, of course, they continue to believe for the sake of appearances that “Ukraine can stop Russia” and demand the continuation of hostilities. But with one more back thought: they want Russia to declare war and even win. But in parallel, they expect to leave Russia in the defeated Ukraine not only with a completely destroyed economy, infrastructure and logistics, but also with a fierce population that hates Russians. And it's scary in any case. And when Ukraine will be under the protectorate of Russia, and when significant parts of it can become the territory of Russia. It is also terrible in the territories of the two self-proclaimed and already recognized in the world DPR and LPR.
24100	15	And, of course, this slows down and complicates all restoration processes in the territories liberated from neo-Nazis. And this is also included in the calculations of the instigators and planners of the war.
24100	17	Secondly, external forces have been interfering in the war for a long time, but - and this is another calculation of the wise men - war hawks from Kyiv - Ukraine wants more. She wants not only to turn the NWO into a war, but also to saddle it with a war between Russia and the entire West, where she will only be an executive power horse.
24100	19	"And the West, stuffing Ukraine with weapons, I repeat, is already drawn into this war. Weapons, money, people: mercenaries and specialists, instructors and advisers. And the shelling of Belgorod and Kursk is evidence of this. And because, for example, in Kyiv itself they do not hide the fact that they want to spur the West on and are already directly hinting that it is a customer. In any case, people's deputy Max Buzhansky cynically stated: ""Belgorod decidedly did not like Lend-Lease."" It is clear that he means the supply of weapons under Lend-Lease, which was initiated by the United States."
24100	21	"This is also evidenced by the information that the commercial satellite GeoEye-1 of the American company Maxar was shooting Belgorod on Thursday, June 30, that is, three days before the missile strike of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, according to RIA Novosti, US satellites Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 also filmed the Belgorod region a week earlier. Explored that is. To more accurately coordinate the fire on peaceful cities. After all, there were no military facilities where the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck. And initially, the strikes were supposed to kill civilians and harden the rest. Three missiles ""Tochka-U"" were with cluster warheads, so that, therefore, there were more victims."
24100	23	And the US satellites are on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - this is a serious international problem. Vladimir Dzhabarov, First Deputy Head of the International Committee of the Federation Council of Russia, has already said that Moscow has the right to impose sanctions against the American company Maxar if it is confirmed that its satellite was used to film Belgorod before Ukrainian troops attacked it.
24100	25	And the head of the Roscosmos state corporation, Dmitry Rogozin, warned at the end of June this year: “I can say that all leading private companies, such as, for example, the same Maxar, are now working exclusively on the formation of a single data cloud that is used by NATO to transmit specific information Ukrainian armed forces. In fact, the entire conglomerate of private and state orbital groups is now working exclusively for our enemy.”
24100	27	And in addition to reconnaissance for strikes against Belgorod and Kursk, commercial satellites, according to RIA Novosti, took photographs of other objects that were attacked from the side a few days later. Rostov region. And this is the involvement of the United States in the war.
24100	29	The strikes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine directly on Russia should stimulate the West to one more thing - to the complete and total replacement of Ukrainian weapons not with old Soviet ones, but with new NATO ones. This will immediately bring the war to a new technological level and spur the arms race. Because, at least, it will provoke Russia to use newer types of weapons - tanks, artillery, drones, etc.
24100	31	And the blows were struck by Ukraine just in time - after the G7 and NATO summits, where the collective West promised to provide Ukraine with even more weapons.
24100	33	"There is also a negative political and propaganda effect from the attacks on the Kursk and Belgorod regions. They were applied on the day when it became known that the LPR was completely liberated from the neo-Nazis. Russian Defense Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu reported this to Russian President Vladimir Putin. And the head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, generally called July 3 ""a new Victory Day."""
24100	35	But the strikes against Russia stimulated in Kyiv a new surge of cannibalistic patriotism among politicians and politicians of all sorts. Even the almost forgotten grandmother of Ukrainian politics and the leader of the Batkivshchyna party, Yulia Tymoshenko, could not stand it. “This is unacceptable for Ukraine. A peace agreement is an illusion, and the only way out is victory in battle. Any peace agreement will be just the first step towards another war,” she told those who think about peace with Russia at the negotiating table.
24102	1	APU strike on Belgorod
24102	3	Impunity that spawned a monster
24102	5	"The strike on Belgorod is another significant episode of how Ukraine conducts hostilities. Obviously, something like this would be condemned in a normal society, but we live in a situation where Russia is being canceled in every sense. Therefore, no one in a ""civilized society"" will condemn Ukraine for this war crime. It has long been clear that in this world there are those who can and should empathize and sympathize with, and there are those whose grief is rejoiced. A similar situation was in the Donbass. Moreover, it did not start in 2022, but since 2014. Of course, this fate has also reached Russian cities, where civilians are dying from the blows of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
24102	7	"The situation in which the entire ""civilized world"" by its silence, in fact, approves of the criminal actions of Kyiv, has created a monster that brings chaos and terror. At the same time, this sick state commits war crimes quite consciously. Moreover, the leadership of Ukraine is so out of touch with reality because of the approval of the West that it even makes some announcements about it."
24102	9	On July 1, Advisor to the President of Ukraine Oleksiy Arestovich promised that Ukraine would give an answer to what happened in Belgorod-Dnestrovsky. Let me remind you that Ukraine blamed the deaths of dozens of civilians on the Russian side, which allegedly delivered a deliberate strike on civilian infrastructure. This is an absolutely uncharacteristic situation for Russia, as even the Americans are talking about. I will quote ex-US Senator Dick Black, who actually admitted that Russia behaves extremely carefully in relation to the Ukrainian population and does not fight with the civilian population. But the Americans behave completely differently with the local population in countries where they participate in hostilities.
24102	11	“There is a well-known photograph of a Russian tank that was stopped by a group of about 40 civilians in Ukraine. They just went out onto the road, blocking it, and as a result, the tank stopped. As a former military man, I can tell you that if a crowd of people got in the way of an American tank in Vietnam, this tank would not slow down for a second! He wouldn't honk, he wouldn't do anything, not even fire a warning shot. He would just move on. And I think it's more typical of war. I am not criticizing Americans. I was there and I fought, and probably I would have driven straight on the tank, because this is a war,” the American politician said in an interview.
24102	13	It turns out that even high-ranking Americans do not believe in the version of the Ukrainian side, especially since the details of the strike on Belgorod-Dnestrovsky have not become public, except for what Kyiv has voiced. But Ukraine fulfilled its threat. Belgorod was shelled, as a result of which civilians were killed, including three refugees from Kharkov. Ukraine killed its own citizens.
24102	15	Officially, Kyiv never admitted that it was he who struck the Russian city. Only a few politicians hastened to hint about this, but changed their position, but more on that later.
24102	17	According to the official statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense, it was the armed forces of Ukraine who struck. “Tonight, from 03:00 to 03:30 Moscow time, the Kyiv regime carried out a deliberate strike with Tochka-U ballistic missiles with cluster munitions and Tu-143 Reis drones on residential areas of Belgorod and Kursk, where there are no military facilities” , the department said in a statement.
24102	19	What happened is the result of the activities of the West, which, in addition to approving such actions, also gives weapons to Kyiv so that such strikes become a reality. And besides, Ukrainian politicians enjoy impunity. They do not even hide, they openly rejoice at the deaths on Russian territory. I will give an example of a politician who until 2022, to put it mildly, was criticized in Ukraine for his conditional pro-Russian character. In fact, it turned out that this deputy adheres to a completely different position.
24102	21	"Maxim Buzhansky is a deputy from the Zelensky party, but was not mainstream. It is difficult to call him a nationalist or a Nazi. On the contrary, Buzhansky had an adequate position, including on the language policy in Ukraine, for which he often fell out of favor with Ukrainian radicals. He criticized the course of the state, but with the beginning of the current events, he suddenly began to voice the theses that are usually characteristic of ""patriotic"" politicians in Ukraine. The situation in Belgorod once again showed who the politicians in Ukraine are, even if they are not as radical as the nationalists."
24102	23	"“Belgorod decidedly did not like Lend-Lease,” Buzhansky wrote in his Telegram channel. After that, he nevertheless changed his position and began to write posts with hints of ""self-attacks"", as the Russian side reported that the air defense had shot down all three missiles. According to Buzhansky, this is evidence of a “self-attack,” but the Ukrainian politician forgot to clarify that the Ukrainian rocket carried a cluster charge that opened up and killed people, including Ukrainian citizens from Kharkov. This is not the first time that Ukraine has used a cluster charge. The center of Donetsk was also shelled on March 14, 2022, when dozens of Donetsk residents were killed and injured. Then the air defense also worked, but the cassettes opened up and fell onto Universitetskaya Street."
24102	25	"The reaction of the West to the situation with Belgorod is predictable - ignoring. This fits right in with the ""our son of a bitch"" strategy. This famous phrase is attributed to US President Roosevelt, who spoke in this way about the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. ""He's a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch"" is the famous expression."
24102	27	That is, the US will support anyone, even dictators, as long as the regime is loyal to Washington. Otherwise, they may immediately notice crimes, but only in the event of a change in course. It is obvious that Ukraine and its government are loyal to the United States. Accordingly, none of the satellites of America will dare to pay attention to another war crime of official Kyiv, which will obviously be perceived in Ukraine as a call to commit more terrible terrorist attacks.
24106	1	Did not work: Bolsonaro called Western sanctions against Russia useless
24106	3	Brazilian President Bolsonaro said US and European sanctions against Russia did not work
24106	5	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro believes that the US and European sanctions imposed against Russia did not work.
24106	7	The economic barriers that the United States and Europe have introduced against Russia have not worked, Bolsonaro said in a video message on social networks.
24106	9	"The head of state noted that he had a ""balanced"" position in relation to Russia, and this allowed him to purchase fertilizers necessary for Brazilian agriculture."
24106	11	Earlier, Life said that at the end of June, during a telephone conversation, Putin told Bolsonaro that the Russian Federation was committed to the obligations of uninterrupted supplies of fertilizers to Brazilian farmers.
24112	1	Irakli Kobakhidze: According to the plan of the radical opposition, at the end of June, Georgia should not receive the status of an EU candidate
24112	3	Georgia, May 31, GEORGINFORM. Under conditions when candidate status does not impose any obligations on the EU in terms of either funding or membership, it is not clear why he should deny this status to the state of Georgia and the Georgian people, when our country and government differ in terms of fulfilling obligations related to introduction, - Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the Georgian Dream, said at a briefing.
24112	5	"As Kobakhidze noted, the government gives the society a promise that ""this scenario of the organizers and participants of the Bakurian meeting, the new Shulaveri committee, the party of war and betrayal in Georgia cannot be realized."""
24112	7	"“As you know, the radical opposition continues to publicly say that Georgia does not deserve the status of an EU candidate. As you know, they talk with the same message with their foreign colleagues. Their goal and calculation is simple: by the end of June, according to their calculation, Georgia, unlike Ukraine and Moldova, should not receive the status of a candidate member of the EU, which, according to their plan, will be followed by public unrest, a coup of power by the ""National Movement"" and its satellites, and drawing Georgia into the war. Everyone is well aware that the EU has no reason to deny Georgia a candidacy, especially if it grants candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. Recall that it was under our rule that Georgia achieved all the tangible results in terms of integration into the EU. It was under the rule of the Georgian Dream that we signed an association agreement and a free trade agreement with the European Union and received a visa-free regime. Georgia is ahead of both applicant countries in all relevant parameters, which no one can deny. In particular, Georgia has already fulfilled 45 percent of its obligations under the Association Agreement, which is an unprecedented result. According to these data, Georgia is ahead of not only Ukraine and Moldova, but also some countries that already have candidate status. In addition, by granting candidate status, the EU does not spend any more euros on Georgia. As you know, the status of a candidate does not oblige the EU to allocate any additional funding to Georgia,” Kobakhidze said."
24112	9	In addition, according to him, the EU does not assume any obligation to join the country within any certain period of time after granting candidate membership status.
24116	1	And the covid seems to be Ukrainian: a sensational investigation of the British
24116	3	Three months before the world learned about COVID-19, the US Department of Defense paid contracts for its “research” as the British conservative publication The Exposé found out.
24116	5	Remember: On February 11, 2020, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the new coronavirus that had spread from China had been given the official name COVID-19. By this day, it was already known about the doctor from the admissions department of Wuhan Central Hospital Ai Feng, to whom a 65-year-old man with an unusual respiratory infection was brought on December 18, 2019. Before his illness, the man worked at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market. This was the first patient with an unusual respiratory infection whom she examined, did tests and found the same coronavirus. It was her discovery that the ophthalmologist of the same hospital, Li Wenliang, tried to make public. He reported the novel virus outbreak on WeChat on December 31, 2019, the Huanan Market was closed the next day, and Li Wenliang developed symptoms of the virus infection on January 10. He died on February 6 in the morning ... But, I repeat, only on February 11 the world learned the name of a new disease - COVID-19.
24116	7	Why is it so important? Yes, because, we repeat, three months before the end of the year, the US Department of Defense paid for the COVID-19 Research contract (COVID-19 Research) ... in Ukraine.
24116	9	The revealed details of the contract are very eloquent, and if they are true, then there is no escape from questions.
24116	11	"According to US government documents, on November 12, 2019, the Pentagon paid for a contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC “COVID-19 Research”, which was carried out in Ukraine and was actually part of a much larger contract with Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp “Biothreat Reduction Program in Ukraine""."
24116	13	And this was 5 weeks before a 65-year-old man who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market was brought to Ai Feng's emergency room? And 3 months before the world found out, what is the name of the terrible attack that came from China? It is easy to imagine that this is only possible if Labyrinth Global Health INC already knew about the existence of Corona Virus Disease- 2019, that is, about the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV coronavirus ...
24116	15	The contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC did not exist only on paper. A peek into the official public source of information on United States government federal spending, The Exposé suggests: According to the website, as of April 12, 2021, the US government has spent $3.63 trillion on COVID-19. But we are most interested in the expenses for the activities of Labyrinth Global Health INC, addressed to Kyiv. And we can easily find them.
24116	17	"Laboratory equipment for Kyiv, office furniture for Kyiv are quite harmless. But the $369,500 of Labyrinth Global Health INC for ""SME Manuscript Documentation and COVID-19 Research"" paid out on November 12, 2019, three months before Covid-19 was officially named, isn't that shocking? And wasn’t the information that the United States set up three dozen biolaboratories in Ukraine that conducted experiments, including on Ukrainians, caused us less shock?"
24116	19	In 14 of them, Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp acted as a contractor: in Kyiv, Odessa, Vinnitsa, Uzhgorod, Dnipro, Lvov, Ternopil, Kharkov, Kherson ... Only the Kherson Diagnostic Laboratory, built in December 2012, cost the US Department of Defense 1,728,822 dollars - spent solely in the interests of ordinary Ukrainians, of course.
24116	21	And, perhaps, the most interesting. The remuneration of Labyrinth Global Health INC was paid based on the results of its activities in Ukraine under a contract that began to operate on September 20, 2012 (!) of the year, it cost $ 21.7 million and was executed on October 13, 2020. What the specialists of the American Biological Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine have managed to do over the years, we will no longer know. Even despite the fact that under the pressure of information about the work of US biolaboratories in Ukraine, provided by the Russian military department, the Americans began to carefully study it. At the same time, Washington analysts are surprised and shrug: “What kind of strains were studied in Washington-funded laboratories? What threat did such work pose to the civilian population? They are surprised, although the United States has retained in its legislation the norms allowing for work in the field of biological weapons, despite the convention on the prohibition of such weapons, signed by 165 states of the world, including ratified by the United States.
24116	23	Agree, if the US government funded research on COVID-19 before it became known about its existence, then this means that they either knew about its existence for a long time, but were silent, or participated in the creation of this virus in the laboratory.
24116	25	The British The Exposé suggests taking into account the fact that the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the American biotechnology company Moderna, which develops medicines based on messenger RNA, had a “candidate” for a coronavirus vaccine in December 2019. This follows from a confidential agreement, which states that Moderna, along with NIAID, agreed to transfer their jointly developed mRNA Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
24116	27	Maybe that's why since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, at least nine people have become dollar billionaires due to the growth in the profits of pharmaceutical companies that produce COVID-19 vaccines? And the first in this nine is the CEO of the American company Moderna Stephane Bancel, who made a fortune of $ 4.3 billion.
24117	1	German economist Hueter: the gas market will collapse if the EU countries think only of themselves
24117	3	Michael Hüter, head of the Institute for German Economics, said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if individual EU states decide to cut off gas supplies to neighboring countries due to a possible shutdown of its supplies from Russia, the European gas market could collapse.
24117	5	“There should not be a situation where individual countries stop their supplies to neighboring ones. This is in the interests of Europe and in the interests of Germany, which exchanges gas with all neighboring countries,” he said.
24117	7	In addition, the expert said that it was necessary to avoid a situation similar to the one that happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when European countries closed their borders, which put European supply chains in jeopardy.
24117	9	“Immediately after the start of the pandemic, some EU states closed their borders, which greatly affected the transportation of goods and supplies to the European Union. This should not happen again,” says Hüter.
24117	11	The economist is sure that the selfishness of the EU countries can lead to catastrophic consequences.
24117	13	“If the EU thinks only of itself, cutting off gas flows to neighboring countries, the collapse of the European gas market threatens to have devastating consequences for companies and consumers. A stoppage of production in the industry is then almost inevitable,” summed up Hüter.
24117	15	Earlier, German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck urged companies that have office space to reduce the air temperature in offices against the backdrop of the energy crisis.
24118	1	"""What happened to Khashoggi is outrageous."" What Biden talked about with the Saudi prince"
24118	3	The head of the White House spoke about this on Sunday, July 17, upon his return from the Middle East tour, TASS reports.
24118	5	On Friday, Biden said that at the meeting he told the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia that he considered him responsible for the murder in 2018 of Khashoggi, who collaborated with the American newspaper The Washington Post.
24118	7	Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir later said he had not heard such a conversation. His words were quoted by a Fox News journalist. The US President was asked to clarify whether these statements of the Saudi minister are true.
24118	9	“No,” the American leader replied.
24118	11	"Biden was also asked if he regrets that he and Mohammed bin Salman greeted each other with the traditional fist-to-fist greeting that has become traditional amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""Why don't you guys talk about what matters? I am happy to answer questions that matter,” he told reporters."
24118	13	The American leader also expressed hope that inflation in the US will start to decline. According to him, in the near future it will become clear whether such a trend is planned.
24118	15	Conversation in Jeddah
24118	17	The fact that Biden, during a conversation with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, allegedly did not claim that he was guilty of the murder of Khashoggi, was reported on Saturday by Fox News journalist Jacqui Heinrich, citing the Kingdom's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.
24118	19	"""Adel al-Jubeir stated in no uncertain terms that he 'didn't hear' Biden telling Mohammed bin Salman that he believed he was responsible for the killing of Khashoggi,"" a correspondent from the White House pool tweeted."
24118	21	Negotiations with the leadership of Saudi Arabia, which were attended by the crown prince, the US president held in Jeddah. “We discussed human rights and the need for political reform. As always, I made it clear that this topic is extremely important for me and for the United States, ”Biden said after the meeting.
24118	23	“As for the Khashoggi murder, I raised this issue at the very beginning of the meeting, making it clear that I thought about it then and what I think now,” he added.
24118	25	One of the reporters asked how Mohammed bin Salman reacted to his words. “He essentially said he was not personally responsible for this,” Biden replied.
24118	27	The US president later said that he did not regret his earlier threats to turn Saudi Arabia into a rogue state in connection with the murder of Khashoggi. “I don’t regret anything I said,” he pointed out, stressing that “what happened to Khashoggi is outrageous.”
24118	29	Murder of a journalist
24118	31	Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the future king of Saudi Arabia, was considered by the US National Intelligence to be the main culprit in the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, known for critical articles about the politics of Riyadh.
24118	33	A journalist who has lived in the United States since 2017 and worked for The Washington Post was killed at the Saudi Arabian Consulate General in Istanbul as a result of the conflict.
24118	35	"In February 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the United States published a report on the assassination of Khashoggi, and, according to the American side, the Saudi crown prince allegedly personally approved the operation, because he saw the journalist as a threat. Then the US administration announced the introduction of visa restrictions for 76 citizens of the kingdom. Biden, as a candidate for the presidency, promised to turn Saudi Arabia into a ""rogue state."" In Riyadh, Washington's conclusions were categorically rejected."
24124	1	In Crimea, they said that the reunification of the south of Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion
24124	3	Adviser to the head of the Crimea Kryuchkov said that the reunification of the south of Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion
24124	5	The reunification of the liberated regions of southern Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion, attempts by the Kyiv authorities to prevent this are doomed to failure, Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea on information policy, told RIA Novosti.
24124	7	"Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, in an interview with the British newspaper The Times, said that Zelensky had ordered the military to liberate the southern territory of the country. For this purpose, ""millions of fighting forces equipped with Western weapons"" are being assembled."
24124	9	The Kyiv regime began a policy of terror, blockades and stuffing against the civilian population of the liberated territories. The official speakers of Kyiv are frightening with a counteroffensive and urging everyone to leave, as they realize that a referendum in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions is inevitable and will be held without fail. The reunification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is a foregone conclusion, and attempts by the Kyiv regime to prevent this are doomed to failure, Kryuchkov told RIA Novosti.
24124	11	According to him, the liberated regions, following the example of Crimea, will become full-fledged subjects of the Russian Federation.
24124	13	During the special operation, the Russian military took control of the Kherson region and the Azov part of the Zaporozhye region in southern Ukraine. Civil-military administrations were formed in the regions, the ruble was put into circulation, and Russian TV channels and radio stations began broadcasting. The regions announced plans to become subjects of the Russian Federation.
24126	1	In the Crimea estimated the likelihood of reunification of the south of Ukraine and Russia
24126	3	Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea on information policy, commented on the likelihood of reunification of the liberated regions of southern Ukraine and Russia. His words are quoted by RIA Novosti.
24126	5	Kryuchkov assessed the possibility of reunification of the Ukrainian regions with the Russian ones and said that this decision was a foregone conclusion. Therefore, the desire of Kyiv to prevent this procedure is doomed to failure, the politician is sure.
24126	7	“The Kyiv regime began a policy of terror, blockades and stuffing against the civilian population of the liberated territories. The official speakers of Kyiv are frightening with a counteroffensive and urging everyone to leave, as they realize that a referendum in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions is inevitable and will be held without fail. The reunification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is a foregone conclusion, and the attempts of the Kyiv regime to prevent this are doomed to failure,” he stressed.
24126	9	The adviser added that the liberated regions will use the experience of Crimea and will become part of Russia as full-fledged subjects
24126	11	“Crimea was, is and will be Russian. Forever. Zaporozhye and Kherson are already waiting in a large and friendly Russian family, ”concluded Kryuchkov.
24126	13	Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said that President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered the recapture of the south of the country. The corresponding task was given to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU). “We understand that politically this is extremely necessary for our country,” Reznikov stressed.
24127	1	We are left with a painful procedure - to sprinkle the wound with salt or treat it with iodine
24127	3	"Successful coup d'état in Georgia has been carried out twice in its modern history. First, in 1991-92, the power of Zviad Gamsakhurdia was curtailed by force of arms, and in 2003, as a result of the ""color revolution"", Eduard Shevardnadze was forced to resign."
24127	5	"Zviad Gamsakhurdia, expelled from his homeland, assessed the first coup as follows: ""The coup d'état in Georgia took place with the approval of US President Bush and with the direct participation of Secretary of State Baker."" No one has yet appreciated the second coup - Shevardnadze went to the grave, publicly saying nothing bad against the Americans (otherwise who knew better than him where, in which state, in which country coup d'etat, ""color revolutions"" were conceived and planned) , contract political assassinations, terrorist acts and thousands of other nasty things and misfortunes)."
24127	7	"And just a few days ago, former national security adviser to President Trump, John Bolton, suddenly made a sensational confession, talking about how the United States planned and carried out “color revolutions” in this or that country. The recognition was followed by a noisy reaction in the world. ""Coup d'etat is a weapon that the US has been using for decades,"" China's Global Times wrote. The article also said: ""The United States is reaping the bitter fruits of the so-called democracy that the White House has been spreading abroad."" The position of the political elite of the United States is assessed as selfish, and the author calls the statements of John Bolton shameless. Dmitry Polyansky, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, believes that “these revelations of Bolton are an admission of a gross violation of the UN Charter, which the world has no right to put up with. Bolton's words should serve as the basis for an international investigation."""
24127	9	"Despite such a sharp reaction, Bolton did not, as they say, back up. His position is: ""Many do not understand what needs to be done to protect the United States."" According to the former adviser, ""it does not matter what other states think on this issue."" It turns out that in the United States to this day they are guided by the not-so-democratic principle of Machiavelli, according to which ""The end justifies the means."" I suppose, after all this, it is superfluous to ask - who is planning the next coup d'état in Georgia? And, by the way, the answer to this main question was not given now, but a very long time ago, although some ambiguities remain: “Why is it now? Or – what do they dislike so much about the actions and decisions of the current Georgian authorities?”"
24127	11	Let's try to approach this problem from the other end. That is, let's start from the opposite: maybe no coup d'état is planned in Georgia? It is clear that no one can directly answer this question for you. The initiators will not admit: yes, we are planning a coup d'état in Georgia. However, it is worth taking a closer look and listening to the statements, actions, moods, positions, soberly following the logic of events, as all this, whether we like it or not, will itself lead us to an unmistakable conclusion - someone somewhere has long been thinking about organizing in Georgia coup d'état. It suffices to recall a few general trends that have recently developed political events in our country, and they themselves will serve as a crying fact that Georgia is being driven into a dead end with all its might:
24127	13	1. Sending Saakashvili to Georgia, moreover, precisely at the time when a large-scale anti-Russian provocation in Ukraine was planned in full swing (documents confirming that the West planned a dirty anti-Russian provocation are now in the hands of Russia);
24127	15	2. Demonstrative refusal of the European Union to grant candidate status to Georgia;
24127	17	3. An attempt to raise mass protests against the current Georgian leadership under the motive of refusing to give the country a candidate status, demands for the resignation of the government and the creation of a so-called technical government;
24127	19	"4. The campaign launched by the opposition to open a ""second front"" in Georgia against Russia;"
24127	21	5. Direct or indirect involvement in these processes of embassies and ambassadors operating in Georgia.
24127	23	This list of events clearly shows that the “fifth column” existing inside Georgia is acting in concert with outside forces. Why, one wonders, did the European Union not begin to grant us the status of a candidate country, if it considered worthy of its being in a state of war, mired in fascist ideology, large-scale corruption and a thousand other obvious vices, Ukraine, if it was not stingy with it for being in no better position than us? , the position of Moldova? What would the EU lose or what responsibility would the European Union assume by throwing us just one word (candidate)? It does not imply absolutely no obligations for the European Union, but why then are they stingy to present us with this empty teaser that says nothing and gives nothing? The answer is unambiguous: in this way (taunting the Georgian people with a forbidden fruit) they tried to provoke a revolutionary situation in Georgia, which, of course, was immediately picked up by the sabotage groups of the West operating within us, who launched an attack on the Georgian authorities, through which, as stated, Georgia, you see Li, lost her chance for candidate status.
24127	25	Such is the provocation, as if played by notes! To which organically joined the sabotage activities of the American and European embassies, which further exacerbated the situation. Just look at what nasty statements US Ambassador Kelly Degnan made after the negative attitude of our government to the issue of joining the sanctions established against Russia. The Prime Minister of Georgia, Irakli Garibashvili, stated that Georgia would not join these sanctions, since this would cause damage not to Russia, but to our own country, and the comment of the American ambassador was as follows: “Today, in such a situation, it is very important to demonstrate unity in relation to Russian aggression which kills thousands of Ukrainian citizens and destroys Ukrainian cities. The purpose of the sanctions is to force Russia to change its actions. I want to stress that no one is asking the Georgian government to impose bilateral sanctions. What we expect from all countries is the coordination of efforts in the interests of international sanctions against Russian aggression.”
24127	27	How do you like? “We are not asking you to establish bilateral sanctions, but coordination is needed on sanctions issues,” the distinguished Ambassador points out to us. And if Georgia becomes stubborn and behaves differently than Ms. Degnan teaches us, she has an answer in store for such a case: “If the country does not join international sanctions, then the results of this will appear!” What could she say? - Like, do not join, and yours will take ?! Of course not. Meaning you'll be sorry. And this is a direct threat, clear and unvarnished.
24127	29	The current Georgian leadership is unacceptable to the West because, unlike the Saakashvili government, it refused to join Western sanctions and join the war with Russia. This is where the dog is buried and lies the main reason for such hostility of the collective West to the current ruling power. The West needs such power and leaders here who, like Saakashvili and Zelensky, will declare war on Russia and abandon their people, leaving them face to face with it. At the same time, the West also needs people who will in every possible way incite their government to a military campaign against Russia and demand radical actions from it.
24127	31	"The fact that the current Georgian leadership categorically does not suit the West was also convincingly confirmed by the American ambassador when she commented on the open letter to her from MP Mikhail Kavelashvili. She wrote: ""To tell the truth, I couldn't read this letter full of lies and conspiracy theories."" Is it possible, after such words, to doubt even one iota in the obviously negative attitude of the ambassador to the deputy Kavelashvili and to his letter?! No, there is no doubt about this attitude. In the same comment, the ambassador argues: “This (Kavelashvili’s letter) is really strange, and, in addition, I want to emphasize that this narrative of a parliamentarian, a former member of the Georgian Dream, about dragging Georgia into the war in a strange way echoes the narrative of party members…” . You can’t say it more clearly through the mouth of a diplomat – I can’t stand Deputy Kavelashvili just as I can’t stand the entire Georgian Dream, because they operate according to the same narrative."
24127	33	It is quite obvious that the West has completely hated the “Georgian Dream”, because it is not going to join the sanctions against Russia, nor does it intend to start a war against it, as this will destroy Georgia. However, the West does not care about the question whether Georgia will perish or not, just as it is not interested in whether Ukraine perishes or not. They need Georgia there, which has joined the war with the Russian Federation, they need more and more provocations against Russia.
24127	35	"Oh, how they need Mikheil Saakashvili today!.. They need him here like air, and it is for this, presumably, that he illegally, in a cargo container, made his way to Georgia. If the ex-president had the opportunity to turn around, he would not only invade Tskhinvali, but also go to Moscow along with his marshals and generals - Giga Makarashvili, Digmelashvili (I'm sorry, but I couldn't remember the name), Misha Mshvildadze, Tako Charkviani, Salome Samadashvili, Ekoy Kherkheulidze, Gubaz Sanikidze, Dato Akubardia and his wife… I would have gone, and even if I hadn’t forced Russia to tear my hair out, I would have sacrificed Georgia anyway, and for the umpteenth time! But this is exactly what our ""strategic partner"" and the ambassador representing him need. What's incomprehensible here?!"
24127	37	"Judge Lasha Chkhikvadze, who passed the guilty verdict on Nika Gvaramia, explicitly states that after that he was immediately contacted by a representative of the US Embassy, ​​who said: the ambassador is interested in why he, the judge, passed a guilty verdict and why he applied imprisonment as a punishment. How do you like such an ""interest"" in the sentencing of the ambassador of the helmsman of world democracy?! They constantly tell us about the independence of the court, but as soon as these statements run into a tendentious interest in a particular case, they arranged an interrogation for the judge. Moreover, not somewhere in their own country, but in another state."
24127	39	"That's what American ""democracy"" teaches us! Have you guessed yet why they were interested in the fate of this Gvaramy? Yes, because, if we paraphrase a little Franklin Roosevelt's famous statement about the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza, Gvaramia may be a son of a bitch, but their (the West's) son of a bitch. No one could be forced to bark at the Russians with such poisonous Russophobia as Gvaramia. That is why they were so “stuck” on his isolation in prison; jammed at such a level that the ambassador gave the judge a thieves' showdown. You can't say otherwise."
24127	41	Nika Gvaramia himself also responded on Facebook in connection with all this. He was excited and outraged, naturally, not by the way the American ambassador dared to put her unwashed hands into the decision of the Georgian court, but by the fact that all this, it turns out, leads to the discrediting of our strategic partner: “On the part of the authorities, this fact is absolutely disgusting and unprecedented discrediting and blackmailing our main strategic partner, which should be considered as part of the open anti-Western campaign of the Georgian Dream.
24127	43	"What kind of anti-Western campaign are you talking about, having angered both God and the devil, the sinner Gvaramia! In your opinion, if the authorities protect their people and their country from being drawn into the war, this is an anti-Western campaign?! Or what can be said about the West itself, which cannot find support in Ukraine other than Zelensky and Arakhamia, and in Georgia is forced to place its hopes on people like Saakashvili and you! Nothing, they will gradually “tie up” not only you, but also false informers completely devoid of conscience, led by a certain Gogashvili, who fed you and your journalists, and then all your atrocities and lies will surface; and all around will shudder from the abomination of your flesh and the stench of your souls. And then no ambassador will help you. She has already given herself away, just like you, and she will have to leave our country. However, until this happens, you will probably still fight a lot, again try to destroy our Motherland, plunging it into a destructive hurricane of war, want to stage a coup d'etat and once again get enough of Georgian blood - you openly promised from the TV screen: “I will drink your blood! I will drink your blood!"" At the same time, with a disgusting grimace, he absorbed some kind of blood-colored liquid. Who knows, maybe it really was blood?!. Everything can be expected from you."
24127	45	This is your essence - the representatives of the dirtiest forces of the West in Georgia, for whom the last times are coming, and therefore you are frantically waving your tails. All for nothing, the era of your masters is ending and your time is running out. See, Joe Biden will end up like Boris Johnson and Mario Draghi. In the West, people are gradually waking up, just as they are sobering up in Georgia. People in Europe and America are already beginning to realize that hatred of Russia actually means hatred of their own peoples; that the path of war and confrontation has driven the West into a dead end from which it will not succeed; that Saakashvili, Zelensky and similar creatures are a malignant tumor on the body of politics, which must be urgently removed and cauterized. This process is currently taking place in Ukraine. They are also trying to activate it in Georgia - we must by no means stop, because we have already cut out the malignant tumor in the face of Saakashvili and Gvaramia, and all that remains is to sprinkle this place with salt or cauterize with iodine. What can you do, the procedure is painful, but mandatory.
24130	1	The State Duma predicted a crushing response to Kyiv in the event of a strike on the Crimean bridge
24130	3	If Kyiv tries to strike at the Crimean bridge, the Russian response will be crushing and will not leave Ukraine a chance to recover. This statement was made by State Duma deputy Mikhail Sheremet, his words are quoted by RIA Novosti.
24130	5	“An attempt by Ukrainian nationalists to attack the Crimean bridge will result in a crushing blow,” the parliamentarian said.
24130	7	According to Sheremet, if such a provocation is attempted, Ukrainian decision-making centers and logistics hubs will be hit.
24130	9	In turn, a member of the Federation Council, Andriy Klishas, ​​said that such intentions of Kyiv once again show the need for denazification and demilitarization of the entire territory of Ukraine.
24130	11	Earlier, Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the head of the office of Vladimir Zelensky, said that the plans of the Armed Forces of Ukraine include an attack on the Crimean bridge. He explained that Ukrainian soldiers attack him at the first appearance of such a technical opportunity.
24135	1	Royal move to victory
24135	3	Today is the most mournful night in Russian history: the night of the brutal murder of the Royal Family. Mournful, but solemn: contrary to the aspirations of the murderers, it became the Night of the Victory of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers over the forces of evil.
24135	5	"The ARNS Forum ""Orthodoxy and the World in the 21st Century"" was dedicated to this event, at which he delivered a lecture ""Empire. Image of the Future"". Soon the Royal Procession begins from the Yekaterinburg Church on Blood, erected on the site of the regicide, to Ganina Yama, where the bodies of the martyrs were destroyed."
24135	7	Every time I participate in this procession, I experience an amazing feeling of spiritual and national unity. But today it is special: many thousands of Russian Orthodox people who arrived in Yekaterinburg on the Tsar's Days are right now conciliarly praying to the Royal Passion-Bearers for the Russian Victory, stolen from us in 1917, when the Russian Empire was already preparing for the Bosphorus operation and the liberation of Constantinople - Constantinople.
24135	9	Today, in the Donbass and Ukraine, our valiant warriors are returning Russia to its historical path. I am sure that their victories are accomplished by the heavenly intercession of the Holy Passion-Bearer Sovereign, invisibly present, as the Master of the Russian Land, on the battlefields.
24135	11	Happy Victory Night, Orthodox! Holy Royal Passion-Bearers, pray to God for us!
24138	1	Latvian authorities support NATO expansion to the north
24138	3	Who would have thought just six months ago that the Latvian parliament would unanimously vote for the ratification of the protocols on accession of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty.
24138	5	The events that began on February 24 launched the process of abandoning the military neutrality of the two EU states, which occupy the 6th and 4th places respectively in terms of territory.
24138	7	“Taking into account the war launched by Russia in Ukraine, Russia’s aggressive rhetoric and violent methods of foreign policy,” said Rihards Kols (National Association), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Seimas, “the risks of conflicts and escalation of instability in the Baltic Sea region have increased significantly.”
24138	9	"Agreeing to a political decision by Helsinki and Stockholm would thus ""shrink Russia's window of opportunity."" R. Coles drew attention to the fact that since the early 1990s, both countries ""to a certain extent gradually approached NATO"", ""participated in many NATO operations."""
24138	11	- We will all benefit from the entry of Sweden and Finland into NATO - both the alliance itself, accepting two mature democracies advocating democratic and legal values, and the Baltic Sea region specifically. The security policy and military capabilities of Sweden and Finland, as well as the desire for rapid further development, do not raise questions. And we can be sure that the collective security guarantees provided for in Article 5 will be significantly strengthened.
24138	13	"The head of the Latvian delegation of the Baltic Sea Parliamentary Assembly Janis Vucans (Union of Greens and Peasants) noted that in the context of Finland's accession to NATO, the status of the Åland Islands belonging to it, an autonomous region, which for a century was not only neutral, but also a demilitarized territory, will also be changed. The question also arises of deploying NATO forces on the Swedish island of Gotland. One way or another, the representative of the opposition SZK called for voting ""only for""."
24138	15	"It is worth noting that in the debate on the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO, the issue of the Arctic was also mentioned, which, according to deputy Kols, “was chosen by alternative regimes as a target for spreading their imperialist ambitions, like Russia, but also economic ambitions, like, say, , China""."
2414	3	The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, made a statement about the infringement of everything Russian. Now not only Ukraine is used for this, the minister noted.
2414	5	The masks have been torn off. We all see. Now Ukraine is not being used to infringe on everything Russian. The whole West has received a command to face,” the head of the Foreign Ministry said, answering questions from journalists.
2414	7	"According to the minister, today we are dealing with a situation where ""you are attacked simply because you have a Russian passport and went into a store, and they took you for a Russian."" And this is what the ""enlightened West"" does, too."
2414	9	The current Russophobia in Western countries can be considered a verdict on Western civilization, Lavrov noted.
2414	11	He also stated that Russia would demand that Ukraine repeal the legislation directed against Russian speakers.
2414	13	"Earlier Sergey Lavrov stated that the negotiations with Ukraine are going hard. The latter ""refuses his own proposals."""
2414	15	The Ukrainian side, although it seems to have expressed understanding of the things that should be agreed upon during the negotiations, is constantly changing its position,” the Russian Foreign Minister explained.
2414	17	The West intends to keep our country in a state of hostilities for as long as possible, Lavrov added.
2414	19	They expect to continue to pump weapons to Ukraine, - said the minister.
24140	3	The United States is on its knees and suffers one historic humiliation after another on the world stage. This opinion was expressed by former US President Donald Trump, speaking at the America First Policy Institute forum in Washington.
24140	5	He explained that under him, Washington was a leader in the issue of energy resources, and gasoline prices and inflation were low and the United States was respected. Now, he pointed out, the US is begging other countries for energy, inflation and fuel prices are at record highs, and millions of migrants are pouring into the country from unsecured borders.
24140	7	“The country is going to hell very quickly,” Trump lamented.
24140	9	"Earlier, Trump accused the current head of state, Joe Biden, of turning the United States into a ""poor country."" He recalled that America ""bows the knee only to God, and to no one else."""
24140	11	On July 15, Trump announced that he had made a decision regarding participation in the 2024 presidential election. The politician said that he is still considering when to announce it - before or after the autumn midterm congressional elections, but expressed confidence in victory if he participates in the election race.
24141	1	Volodin blamed the US for the coronavirus pandemic
24141	3	Coronavirus spread from US biological laboratories, America became the culprit of the pandemic. This was stated by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin in his Telegram channel.
24141	5	The politician issued accusations against the United States in response to the statement of the American scientist and head of the commission on COVID-19 Jeffrey Sachs, who said that the coronavirus was most likely created in an American laboratory.
24141	7	“Millions of sick and dead people, the global economic crisis, a drop in people’s living standards are the consequences of COVID-19 for which Washington needs to be held accountable,” the speaker of the lower house of parliament said.
24141	9	According to him, in response to the US accusations, President Joe Biden is silent. This is explained, according to Volodin, by the fear of the American leader to name the real culprit of the pandemic.
24141	11	The politician pointed to the need to declassify the military biological developments of the United States and stop them. He called America to account for the spread of COVID-19, and also stated the need to compensate states affected by the pandemic for losses.
24141	13	"Earlier, Volodin had already allowed a leak of COVID-19 from an American laboratory. Then he suggested that the United States continues to work on modeling the virus in parallel, and if it is not stopped, the world will be ""hostage to new and new situations."""
24154	1	The Foreign Ministry considers the inevitable cooperation between Russia and the West in the future
24154	3	The West, after the completion of a special military operation, will have to live and cooperate with Russia, the conditions for this are being set now, Dmitry Polyansky, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the world organization, said at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Ukraine.
24154	5	“By supplying Ukraine with long-range artillery systems and MLRS, you, in fact, shift the conditional security line necessary for the peaceful development of the mentioned regions further to the west, thus clarifying the goals and objectives of our special military operation. Think about this, as well as the fact that after its completion you, one way or another, will still have to live next to us and cooperate. You now largely set the conditions for this stage yourself, ”TASS quotes Polyansky.
24154	7	He also pointed out that the willingness of the West to help Ukrainians kill Donetsk and Luhansk children is unlikely to be forgotten, both by the Ukrainian and Russian people.
24154	9	Earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian side does not record changes in the positions of the West and its readiness to make concessions on the Ukrainian crisis.
24154	11	"Readers of the New York Post appreciated the statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called on China to ""remain neutral"" and not help Russia."
24154	13	“I hope to see the day when this corrupt NATO stooge of Zelensky is captured, stripped naked (no more fake military T-shirts), chained, then whipped and sent to eastern Ukraine to face a real trial for his war crimes.” , - wrote Freddie, RIA Novosti reports.
24154	15	"""Did he say that before or after the Vogue photo shoot?"" – noted the user ata777."
24154	17	"""If America can help Ukraine, why can't China help Russia?"" asked Oksure."
24154	19	“Oh, so now you want to tell China what to do? You are a laughing stock,” wrote Ralph Holloway.
24154	21	Earlier, the American media wrote that Zelensky should not be dismissive of the internal problems of the United States, while demanding further support from Washington.
24156	1	Chile's bishops object to draft constitution over abortion and euthanasia
24156	3	His categorical rejection of the changes in the Constitution of Chile, legalizing euthanasia and abortion, declared the country's Catholic bishops. This was reported on July 23 by the Catholic portal Crux.
24156	5	“We condemn norms that allow termination of pregnancy, leave open the possibility of euthanasia, distort the understanding of the family, limit the freedom of parents in raising children, as well as those that impose certain restrictions on the right to education and freedom of religion,” the bishops said in a statement.
24156	7	“We consider it especially serious to introduce abortion, which in the proposed text of the constitution is called the “right to voluntary termination of pregnancy,” the priests emphasize.
24156	9	Their statement also says that the rule that opens the door to abortion not only excludes the participation of the father in this decision, but simultaneously gives the right to personal and institutional conscientious objection to military service.
24156	11	Regarding the right to assisted suicide and euthanasia, the bishops believe that “it is an ambiguous right because it aims to solve the problem by deliberately ending human life. This is its dehumanizing nature, because it encourages a “disposable culture” and can make the lives of people already weakened by the disease even more fragile.”
24156	13	"They also accused the article of the Constitution of distorting the concept of the family, recognizing ""families in their various forms, manifestations and ways of life, not limiting them exclusively to filial and consanguineous ties."""
24156	15	“Public debate in recent weeks shows us that the proposed text has not elicited widespread and universal acceptance,” the bishops wrote in a statement. “Then we are faced with a choice between two highly polarized positions, and that makes it difficult for every citizen to decide.”
24156	17	Recall that on July 4, after a year-long drafting process, a new version of the constitution was presented to President Gabriel Boric. In October 2020, 78% of Chile's voters supported the creation of a new Constitution as part of the abandonment of the legacy of the 17-year rule of dictator General Augusto Pinochet.
24156	19	The rewrite of the constitution was approved by the government after massive protests in 2019 brought the country to a standstill, and although Boric was not yet in power at the time, he poured most of his political capital into the project.
24156	21	The new constitution will be one of the longest in the world. Compared to the document of the Pinochet era, it is broader and enshrines many innovations, including freedom of speech, abortion, the right to clean air and water, and the state's national health service.
24156	23	However, the first reaction to the document was negative, including because it would lead to the exclusion of the Senate from the country's current bicameral Congress.
24157	1	Permitted murders: Patriarch Kirill compared abortion with the death penalty
24157	3	The Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus' Kirill, during his speech at the opening of the XXIX International Educational Readings, touched upon the issue of abortion, comparing them with the death penalty, which is prohibited in Russia. “Society drives itself into a trap of legal contradictions.
24157	5	“Society drives itself into a trap of legal contradictions. If we refuse the death penalty, recognizing the inviolability of life, then why is abortion and euthanasia considered acceptable? After all, human life is destroyed here and there,” said His Holiness.
24157	7	In addition, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church called it unacceptable the creation of state and public structures that, under the pretext of protecting children, interfere in family affairs.
24157	9	“The unreasonable removal of children is a line that cannot be crossed. This is a red line,” the Patriarch emphasized.
24158	1	US reputation in the EU collapsed after the tragedy in Texas and the decision on abortion
24158	3	Massive armed attacks and the overturning of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion have undermined the reputation of the United States in Europe, Axios reports with reference to a public opinion poll on July 27.
24158	5	According to data obtained as part of a survey by Morning Consult, the reputation of the United States in European countries has significantly strengthened since the start of the Russian special operation to denazify Ukraine. Within two weeks of the start of the operation, an average of 9% more respondents favored the US, pushing that figure to around 25% by the end of May.
24158	7	However, the honeymoon was short-lived, company experts say, and after the shooting of young children at a school in the Texas city of Uvalde, as well as after the cancellation of the Supreme Court decision on abortion, the number of those who favor the United States fell, and by today fluctuates around the mark of 13-15%.
24158	9	The company's specialists draw attention to the fact that the country's image abroad can affect a wide range of issues: from its foreign policy effectiveness to economic influence.
24158	11	“A study of how a country’s position in a given market can affect its exports to that market shows that the consequences can be huge: one study found that a one position increase in the world ranking of countries by the reputation of their products is associated with a 2% increase in exports. , and that the reputation of the population of the country can also influence the volume of exports,” they noted.
24158	13	“The situation is similar with tourism, another industry highly dependent on foreign demand: a number of studies have shown a close relationship between the image of a country abroad and the desire of tourists to visit it,” Morning Consult added.
24160	1	US abortion supporters vote less frequently than opponents: poll
24160	3	Opponents of overturning the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion are less likely to vote than those who support or are indifferent to the move, The Hill reported citing a July 29 poll.
24160	5	"According to a public opinion poll, the results of which were published on July 29, 65% of respondents believe that the overturning of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ""Roe v. Wade"" was a ""significant loss for women's rights"". 35% do not agree with them. However, only 52% of those who opposed the overturning of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade intend to go to the midterm elections, which will be held in November this year, while those who are indifferent to this event, to the elections 70% of respondents are ready to go."
24160	7	Only a third of women under 40 say they will vote with confidence, despite being in the demographic most concerned about access to abortion.
24160	9	The figures are a blow to Democrats, who see abortion as a major electoral issue and a way to revitalize their supporter base in a difficult election year. Democratic candidates at all levels, and the groups that represent them, have been vehemently critical of their opponents for their stance on abortion in recent months.
24162	1	"The Russian Embassy in the United States commented on reports of ""strike"" on the ZNPP"
24162	2	The Russian Embassy in the United States called for an end to Russophobic fabrications about strikes on the ZNPP
24162	4	"WASHINGTON, August 8 - RIA Novosti. The Russian Embassy in the United States, after reports from American media accusing Russian forces of ""strike"" on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, called on American journalists to stop repeating ""Russophobic fabrications."""
24162	5	We call on the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency to condemn the criminal actions of Kyiv and take urgent measures to prevent provocations at radiation hazardous facilities in Ukraine. And American journalists - to stop bawling Russophobic fabrications, - the diplomatic mission says in a widespread commentary.
24162	7	The American media launched a sweeping disinformation campaign, the embassy stressed. And the shelling of the ZNPP by the Armed Forces of Ukraine creates a real threat to the nuclear security of Europe, the commentary says.
24162	9	Earlier, Energodar authorities said that on Sunday night, Ukrainian troops launched a strike from the Uragan MLRS at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, fragments and a rocket engine fell about 400 meters from the station’s operating power unit. The shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the Zaporozhye NPP, in case of damage to the power unit, threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of residents of Ukraine, foreign Europe, and Asia, the city administration stressed.
24162	10	ZNPP has been under the control of the Russian military since March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the justification for taking the power plant under protection from the point of view of preventing leaks of nuclear and radioactive materials. The department also recalled that the Ukrainian operator continues to manage the station.
24166	1	"New victims on the global ""green"" altar - cows and Ukrainians"
24166	3	Reading the world news of recent months, one is sometimes amazed at how completely incompatible stories can be combined in one newspaper page or in one television news release. For example, one of the main problems of the current global crisis at all levels is world hunger, which, according to UN estimates, already affects up to ten percent of the world's population and continues to expand. And now the TV presenter of some news channel reads out these data, shows the starving children of Africa or Asia, after which, without a twinge of conscience, joyfully announces the decision of the government of one or another large state within the framework of green policy to drastically reduce the number of livestock. And no one has any idea to connect these two plots together. What for? After all, Russia can always be blamed for world hunger, which Western politicians and propagandists have been actively doing lately.
24166	4	"They, however, recently had a serious headache in the form of Sri Lanka, where thoughtless green reform led to a food crisis, riots and the overthrow of power. What efforts are now being made by the Western media, environmental activists and various Soros ""anti-fake"" structures to convince the world community that the events in Sri Lanka have nothing to do with the decisions of the island government to ban inorganic fertilizers, which ultimately led to a record crop failure and food shortages. No, no, of course - it's Russia's fault, as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said bluntly. Well, yes, it was Putin who sharply reduced the harvest of tea and rice in Sri Lanka."
24166	6	Or let's take another example. For several months, the Netherlands has been rocked by protests from farmers who are outraged by the government's officially announced plans to significantly reduce the number of livestock and poultry in the country. In total, The Hague requires farm owners to reduce this figure by a third within a fairly short period of time. It will be especially difficult for the owners of cows - there the planned reduction sometimes reaches 95 percent, which will inevitably lead to ruin and business closure.
24166	8	But the Netherlands is one of the world's major meat producers, the world's fourth largest supplier of dairy products and the second largest food exporter after the United States. With a relatively small territory, this country is the seventh in terms of the number of livestock in the European Union.
24166	9	And here's what's interesting. Almost all the world's media in one way or another cover the protests of Dutch farmers and the decision of the government of Mark Rutte that caused them. But someone, in general, calculated how such a sharp blow to the farming sector in the Netherlands will affect the global food market? Has anyone linked this decision to the problem of global hunger? Oh, yes, because you can always blame Russia again. It will even be interesting to hear future explanations from Western propagandists about how Moscow influenced the decision of The Hague to reduce the number of Dutch cattle.
24166	10	"And now greens all over the world are squealing with delight over the New Zealand government's latest decision to impose a special tax on ... how to put it more culturally - methane emissions from cows. Authorities explain their ruling as follows: ""Agriculture accounts for more than half of New Zealand's methane production, and methane is a huge contributor to global warming and air pollution."""
24166	12	"Critics of the decision warn outright that it will destroy New Zealand farms. The Australian issue of The Spectator points out: ""In this case, the agricultural industry should be sacrificed on the altar of climate change - as far as one can tell, for no scientific reason, given that our collective emissions are too small to make a difference."""
24166	13	"And in the footsteps of New Zealand, Australia intends to follow, and, perhaps, other countries will follow. Environmental activists are already demanding to cut the number of New Zealand livestock by half. They argue: ""The intensive dairy industry is a false economy. While the benefits accrue to a small number of people in the industry, everyone has to pay. The costs are often borne by those who are least to blame for climate change and those who are most vulnerable."" Who will bear the burden of a rise in prices or a shortage of meat and dairy products after the disappearance of cows, green activists do not care at all. Neither do they care about the problems of global hunger, which are sure to get worse as the number of livestock in the countries that are the world's main food suppliers is reduced. And after all, none of the greens offers any other alternative. Reduce, destroy, ""destroy to the ground"" - and then? We'll see what happens next."
24166	14	"And here are only the most striking examples of the phenomenon, which in conservative circles has already received the name ""eco-tyranny"". But these problems are faced by farmers in almost all Western countries and (as we see from the example of the same Sri Lanka) a number of not the richest third world countries. In this regard, the mainstream press is more concerned about the fact that the protests of farmers against eco-tyranny give political dividends to right-wing political forces. It turns out that this is the main, almost the only problem of the West. What about world hunger? No, we didn't hear anything. While we are not talking about Russia, of course."
24166	15	But the tireless eco-activists George Soros have a new interest - Ukraine. At the moment, the pro-Western regime in Kyiv is actively proposing to use the territory of the country under its control as a testing ground for testing new types of weapons. And it does not matter how many experimental Ukrainians will die in this case. And the people of Soros already now, without waiting for the end of hostilities, are calling for turning Ukraine into a testing ground for expanding the global green experiment described above.
24166	17	"These plans were shared on the pages of the Financial Times by a senior employee of the Soros Foundation Open Society Heather Grabbe. She calls for this unique opportunity to ""create the first truly low-carbon economy in Europe."" Judging by her explanation, by this chance she means the total destruction of the Ukrainian economy. Here, for example, is what Grabbe writes: ""Steel is a good example. Ukraine's biggest source of pollution, the Mariupol Iron and Steel Works, lies in ruins."" If we consider the destruction of the Azovstal plant, which the militants of the Nazi units tried to make their fortress as a ""good example"", then this really says a lot about the plans for global eco-tyranny regarding Ukraine."
24166	18	"The Soros activist calls for the use of frozen Russian finances abroad for ""insurance of political risks"" (you must admit, a good replacement for the not very courteous term ""robbery"" was invented by the Open Society) and eventually turn Ukraine into a raw materials appendage of ""decarbonized Europe"". To do this, the European Union, according to Grabbe, should support small farms in Ukraine on the condition that they produce organic products. One would like to add: as in Sri Lanka. But such a comparison among the Greens after the well-known events is not accepted."
24166	19	"That is, they propose to expand the global green experiment to Ukraine, having previously destroyed it to the ground (you can see what a ""good example"" is the destruction of industrial giants polluting the air). How can one not ask the question: is it not for this reason that the Soros structures invested a lot of money in inciting the Ukrainian crisis, and, accordingly, in the destruction of Ukrainian statehood as such? Indeed, on the ruins it is much easier to build test sites and experiment on the experimental population. What will happen to him is secondary. After all, if a new crazy idea proves to be untenable, as it has been until now, you can always blame everything on Russia again. Not to the West! And especially not on Soros."
24169	1	"Kyiv urged to check Amnesty International for ""benefits"" from Russia"
24169	2	Ukraine urged to investigate whether Amnesty International benefits from Russia
24169	4	"In Kyiv, they called for an investigation into whether the human rights organization Amnesty International receives ""benefits"" from Russia. The corresponding requirement for verification was made by the assistant to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak, TASS reports."
24169	6	"He believes that in their latest report, human rights activists have discredited ""the concept of international humanitarian organizations"", which, he says, will have detrimental consequences."
24169	8	"On August 4, Amnesty International published a report in which they talked about the crimes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The report says that Kyiv causes ""harm to the civilian population by using weapons systems in populated areas, including schools and hospitals."" Thus, not only military law is violated, but also international humanitarian law."
24171	3	“Among these neighboring peoples, there are still things that we cannot fully understand,” Henrihs Soms, professor of history at Daugavpils University, speaks at Latvijas Avīze.
24171	5	He draws attention to the changes in his native land: “In peaceful conditions in Latgale, there were many people who did not like the Latvian language, who believed that Riga was taking all the resources, that the state had a wrong policy, such an amorphous electorate that supported the policy of Russia.
24171	7	In connection with the war in Ukraine, the number of these people has decreased. For now it is difficult to say so simply: “I am for Russia!” Now it is intellectually necessary to invent why the Russian authorities and the state like it if they attack Ukraine, and why this is welcome.
24171	9	Most of the Russian-speakers have become quiet, others say about the war in Ukraine: “Latvians, don’t interfere between Russians and Ukrainians, you don’t understand anything!” There were Russians from Daugavpils who also said so in March, when the flag of Ukraine was hoisted at the Daugavpils Musical High School and the uproar began. And he needed to listen and think.
24176	3	The policy of anti-Russian sanctions of the European Union is thoroughly erroneous, only mutual respect will help overcome the crisis that has arisen, said Laszlo Kever, speaker of the Hungarian parliament.
24176	5	"“The outside world can also learn a lot from us. For example, EU leaders in Brussels - if they ever grace us with their sincere interest - may learn the truth of the Turkish proverb: ""If you don't get on a horse, don't swing your leg."" This is useful knowledge, because the EU leaders… with their thoroughly misguided sanctions policy, for example, were swinging their legs without a horse under them… The sad outcome of this will be that the EU leaders in Brussels will smash the entire European economy to dust along with them,” said Kever, speaking to the guests of the festival of traditions of the Huns and Turks ""Kurultai"", RIA Novosti reports."
24176	7	According to him, it will be possible to overcome crises and challenges only “if both in the West and in the East all people who do not want to erase or falsify the past find each other and unite with each other, but want to learn from it; those who do not want to appropriate the present and the future, but want to share it with others, mutually respecting each other's faith, culture, homeland, national state and human dignity.
24176	9	Earlier, the French media recalled how French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on March 1 that anti-Russian sanctions are “terrifyingly” effective.
24183	3	The developers of the Google maps mapping service sent an official request to the Russian leadership with a request to clarify Moscow's forecasts about a possible revision of the borders of European states in the next 10 years.
24183	5	“We know that there are many talented analysts in Russia whose models of the future almost always come true. Since 2005, the map of Europe has changed several times, we would be very grateful to Russia if it shared its forecasts on the prospects for changing borders until 2032,” said Lars Rasmussen, head of Google maps.
24185	3	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the job offer that Vladimir Zelensky made to him during their meeting in Kyiv. After the end of his term as head of the British government, Johnson may take the post of governor of the Odessa region.
24185	5	According to Zelensky, the post of head of the Odessa administration was repeatedly and successfully held by foreigners - starting with the Duke de Richelieu and ending with ex-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili. Opinion polls show that Johnson has an 11% rating in Odessa, higher than any other gubernatorial candidate in the past 20 years. Boris Johnson said on social networks that he had not yet accepted the offer, because he was not sure that the head of the Southwestern Federal District would approve it.
24186	3	Moscow urbanist Daniil Kurdyukov, who relocated to Georgia in March, offered to translate road signs in Tbilisi into Russian and even opened a fundraiser for this purpose. According to the designer, the Georgian language is incomprehensible to migrants from Russia, so Russian or English should be used instead.
24186	5	Kurdyukov plans to raise about $2,000. With this money, he will create a design for new street signs, and then transfer it to the city authorities.
24186	7	“Let's be honest, few people understand these squiggles - even if you translate them with a Google camera, it's still impossible to remember, they simply merge in your eyes. There are signs in English in the center, but living in the center is expensive, many settle on the outskirts. Therefore, it is necessary to make new signs and make them humanly - in Russian or in English, ”he wrote on Facebook
24189	3	The office of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky invited the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to visit the new 95th quarter beer restaurant, which opened in the center of Kyiv. According to the President, the Crown Prince will not be able to taste such pork ribs anywhere else.
24189	5	The restaurant was opened by Zelensky's business partners in the 95th quarter studio, the president's office said. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader himself is not the owner of the establishment: the shares in it belong to his step-uncle and second cousin. The menu includes more than 30 varieties of German beer, pork ribs, Ukrainian borscht, dumplings, palyanytsya and other dishes of national cuisine. In addition to entertainment and treats, Zelensky intends to discuss with Prince Mohammed the possibility of lowering oil prices.
2423	3	Chargé d'Affaires of the United States in Ukraine Christina Quinn announced the parallel between the President of the Russian Federation and the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Both started a bloody war, killing people indiscriminately and ignoring the nations.
2423	5	"Queen announced this in an interview for RBC-Ukraine. According to Quinn, both Hitler and Putin both started a ""war of choice"". The US Charge d'Affaires in Ukraine noted that our country did not provoke aggression from the Russian Federation, which the country constantly promotes among its population."
2433	2	Political scientist Markelov told how Western aid harms Ukraine
2433	4	The Russian military continues successful actions to denazify Ukraine. Political adviser Sergei Markelov, specifically for 360, told why the Russian army is hitting factories and warehouses, and also what is fraught with Western help for Ukraine.
2433	5	Russian political strategist, political scientist Sergei Markelov
2433	7	Next is direct speech.
2433	8	About technology in Ukraine
2433	10	In the Kharkov region, on the outskirts of Lozovaya, Russian troops destroyed the buildings of a forging and mechanical plant with long-range missiles. They were engaged in the restoration and repair of armored vehicles.
2433	12	According to 2021 data, there were almost 450 enterprises in Ukraine where military equipment could be serviced and repaired. Ukraine during the Soviet era occupied almost 17% of the military-defense complex. Although most of it is no longer there, today we see enough industrial zones that can produce, as well as current, operational and strategic repairs of military equipment.
2433	14	"On average, Russian troops have ""nullified"" about 50% of such enterprises. Such targeted testing of such industrial zones, where military equipment can be stored, altered, repaired and simply hidden, is an indispensable element of our actions."
2433	16	For Ukraine, this is a problem of defense capability and the availability of military equipment. On the one hand, it is destroyed catastrophically quickly, on the other hand, if it is damaged, it is no longer subject to repair. Therefore, the Ukrainian side is shouting at the top of its lungs that they really need new equipment to recharge.
2433	17	About aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
2433	19	Russian air defense shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 in the Slavyansk region, 13 Ukrainian UAVs were destroyed in the Donbass, Kharkiv and Zaporozhye regions. These air losses are very sensitive for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
2433	21	Military insiders give approximately the following statistics: in the first month of a special military operation, 5-6% of aviation equipment and all kinds of drones left the existing ones per day. In the second month, a little less - they went out by 2-3% per day. Today, by the hundredth day, there is somewhere in the region of 0.5-1% of the destruction of air military equipment per day.
2433	23	Statistics - both ours and not ours - have long shown that Ukraine does not have flight personnel and weapons that can conduct military operations from the air. And she collects from Europe one by one, using gray, white, black schemes for the supply of equipment.
2433	24	On Western aid and its consequences
2433	26	Of course, Ukraine is really looking forward to the F16 military multipurpose fighters promised by the Americans, which they promised to deliver at the end of June or in the middle of July. However, according to experts, the planes will be able to arrive in a maximum of three to four months. After all, to transfer 100 military aircraft across half the globe is a serious logistical operation.
2433	28	Strategically and tactically, the Russian armed forces have created a balance in which it is unlikely that anything will stop us. It seems to me that from the point of view of political and military expertise, we already understand how equipment appears on the battlefield. And, accordingly, we can start to beat them from the moment they enter the territory of Ukraine.
2433	30	All the injections that the West makes in the form of various support for the troops of Ukraine do not complicate our work. We are moving forward and achieving our goals, taking the territories designated by our president.
2437	3	The United States forced the European Union to impose sanctions against Russia, the EU itself was not going to do this, said the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. According to her, the United States is trying to prevent the strengthening of Russia and the EU through close mutual ties.

2437	6	US policy is aimed at containing not only Russia, but also Europe, says Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.
2437	7	"Washington's actions are the implementation of a containment policy, but in this case, containment is not only Russia, it is containment of Europe as well,"" she said in an interview with Arguments and Facts."
2437	9	According to her, the United States, in particular, is trying to prevent the strengthening of ties between Russia and the EU.
2437	11	To allow close ties between Europe and Russia is to strengthen both. And it was Washington that forced the European Union to adopt sanctions, and both (U.S. Vice President Joseph) Biden and (U.S. Secretary of State John) Kerry recognized this. The European Union did not intend to do this, but did it under pressure. How pressed? What arguments did the States use? A very good question for the future. And someday we will find out, - said Zakharova.
2455	1	Cultural figures urged to withdraw funding from artists who criticize the SVO in Ukraine
2455	3	Artists, writers, directors and representatives of other creative professions discussed on the air of the press center of the Patriot media group the reasons for the growth of Russophobic sentiments among domestic cultural figures and ways to overcome this disease.
2455	5	The media report on the plans of the Russian government to audit budgetary spending on culture. Sources say that the validity and fitness for purpose of allocating budgetary funds to support cinema, the creation of television series and theatrical productions in the period from 2012 to 2020 raises doubts. As a result, works that discredit the moral values ​​of the country and distort its history and present were created at the expense of the budget. Preferences from the state are received by a narrow circle of authors, the vast majority of whom left Russia after the start of the SVO and make slanderous statements in relation to the goals and methods of the special operation in Ukraine, as well as to high-ranking statesmen.
2455	7	Member of the Russian Union of Writers, public figure, poet and teacher Oleg Tarunov considers the spread of anti-patriotic sentiments among representatives of creative professions to be the activities of foreign non-governmental organizations that lure creative Russians to their side by banal bribery.
2455	9	“People of culture and art, often liberal-minded, have additional funding from abroad. The recently implemented law on foreign agents allows them to enter the stream of the media sphere, to be constantly in the frame, it is naturally easier for such a person to receive some kind of subsidies and funding. And a patriotic poet, I can classify myself as such, does not shout about himself at every step, he writes a work in solidarity with what is happening, which is a reflection of his soul, morality, moral qualification, his position in this situation, ”- Oleg Tarunov said.
2455	11	According to Yevgeny Antipov, an artist and publicist, president of the Association of Creative Associations of the North-West, pro-Western cultural figures are, as a rule, more enterprising and obsessed with money. In their system of values, wealth prevails over spiritual and moral ideals, so they easily betray their homeland and their compatriots, the publicist believes.
2455	13	“Such people tend to be vulgar. They have a weather vane inside: in which direction the wind blows, they turn in that direction - this is what ensured their survival and profitability. And we all know that for the last 30 years the most well-paid topic has been Russophobia. People who are now criticizing their country, some of them were convinced Russophobe, some joined, and some became Russophobe for the company - since they give money, why not blather? Thus, a whole pool of creative people, sometimes even talented ones, was formed, who are engaged in frank deconstruction of our society, ”explained Evgeny Antipov.
2455	15	Russian officials also played their part in the formation of an anti-patriotic stratum of creative workers, believes a member of the Arctic Academy of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Geographical Society, director, producer and screenwriter Sergei Nadein.
2455	17	“Officers are to blame - this is one hundred percent, because they make decisions on the direction of funding for creative projects. Before issuing a grant, they, of course, get acquainted with the content of the ideas that they contain,” Sergey Nadein noted.
2455	19	In his opinion, now leaving Russia are mainly those cultural figures who had long planned to do this, but did not want to lose the source of their well-being.
2455	21	“They were ready to leave a long time ago, they never loved our country, our people, now a very “convenient” opportunity has turned up for them,” the director believes.
2455	23	Experts support the intention of government agencies to revise the policy of providing budget funding for the implementation of creative projects in the direction of encouraging their patriotic orientation. At the same time, it is not ruled out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, some form of censorship of the content of works of art should be introduced in the Russian Federation.
2455	25	“In this case, I think some censorship is appropriate. When such terrible events take place as now, how can you speak out against your country?” — said the writer and publisher Victoria Sherwood.
2455	27	Yevgeny Antipov believes that such censorship should at least be internal for creative workers.
2455	29	“The fact is that culture is a system of delimitations, it is self-censorship, censorship of introduced history, mental,” the artist explained.
2455	31	Oleg Tarunov considers creative workers who loudly declare their opposition to Russia's actions to force Ukraine to peace as outright traitors.
2455	33	"“To accept or not to accept back such cultural figures is everyone's business. But in my opinion, what they have done now is at least an indirect factor that can be classified by the phrase ""treason."" I think that our simple people will not accept these people, because they feel their real attitude towards themselves, no matter how they try to mislead people, ”the poet believes."
2455	35	In his opinion, the majority of Russian citizens are aware of the difficult problem our servicemen are solving in Ukraine.
2456	3	Subject: Russian military special operation in Ukraine
2456	5	Russophobia in the West has reached unimaginable limits. The culture that has always served as a pillar of international cooperation has suffered. Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Degas' Russian Dancers are canceled in Europe.
2456	7	The anti-Russian agenda of many Western countries is gaining momentum every day. Against the backdrop of Russia's special operation in Ukraine in Europe and America, they took up arms not only against the political elite of Russia and the Russian economy, but also, which was not the case before, against Russian culture.

2456	10	"The National Gallery in London has changed the name of Edgar Degas's well-known painting ""Russian Dancers"" to ""Ukrainian Dancers"", follows from the data on the museum's website. The decision was made after the relevant appeals of the Ukrainians in social networks, reports RIA Novosti."
2456	12	"""The title of this painting has been the subject of ongoing discussion for many years and has been covered in the scientific literature, however it has received increased attention over the past month due to the current situation, so we felt it was the right moment to update the title of the painting to better reflect it. topic,"" said a representative of the National Gallery."
2456	14	The painting depicts dancers from Eastern Europe who visited France in the 1990s and performed at the Moulin Rouge and the Casino de Paris. All the girls on the canvas are dressed in long skirts and white shirts. An important feature, according to Internet users, is the flower wreaths on their heads, all of which are depicted in national Ukrainian colors - yellow and blue.
2456	16	"The canvas of the French impressionist of the early twentieth century is not currently exhibited in the gallery. The National Gallery also announced that due to Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, it will not include Raphael's painting ""The Holy Family"" from the State Hermitage collection in the exhibition ""Credit Suisse: Raphael"", which is scheduled to start on April 9."
2456	18	"Earlier, according to The Independent, the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra decided to remove the Pyotr Tchaikovsky overture from the program. The orchestra considered the performance of the overture ""1812"" allegedly ""unacceptable at such a time."""

2456	21	"In early March, the Bavarian State Opera severed ties with opera singer Anna Netrebko and conductor Valery Gergiev for ""insufficiently distancing themselves"" from Russia's special operation in Ukraine."
2456	23	"""Due to Russia's terrible offensive war in Ukraine and the lack of sufficient distancing on the part of Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko, the Bavarian State Opera is nullifying all existing relationships,"" wrote the opera's executive director, Serge Derny."
2456	25	Also, the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra stopped cooperating with Gergiev. This decision was taken by the mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter.
2456	27	Munich parts ways with Valery Gergiev. From now on, there will be no more concerts of the IFO under his leadership, - Izvestia reports the words of the head of the city.
2456	29	I hoped that he would reconsider his very positive assessment of the Russian president. He didn't. In the current situation, however, a clear signal to the orchestra, the public and the city would be necessary for further cooperation. After this has not followed, it remains only to leave immediately,” Reiter said.
2456	31	Gergiev has served as chief conductor of the IFO since 2015. The contract with him was calculated until 2025.
2456	33	Italy
2456	35	The University of Milan in Italy has removed books by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky from its program amid the conflict in Ukraine. This was done to avoid potential controversy, the university said.
2456	37	However, this news greatly shocked users of social networks, in connection with which the university authorities allowed Dostoevsky to teach again, reports Regnum.
2456	39	By analogy with the Bavarian scandal, the name of the prima donna Netrebko was removed from the March posters of La Scala.
2456	41	"The Milan theater has reported that one of the best sopranos in the world is ""sick"". However, the star of the opera scene herself replied: ""I am healthy, but I will not come,"" RIA Novosti reports."
2456	42	USA
2456	44	New York's Carnegie Hall has canceled the participation of Valery Gergiev, who was supposed to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The name of pianist Denis Matsuev was also deleted from the poster.
2456	46	"Carnegie Hall did not name the reason. However, the American press voiced the fears of the leadership of the famous concert hall and the board of trustees of Carnegie Hall that ""Maestro Gergiev's participation in concerts in such a situation could be misinterpreted and the wrong signal could be sent to society,"" writes RIA Novosti."
2456	48	On the Day of the Cultural Worker, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech in which he drew attention to the attack on Russian culture in the West, but expressed the hope that it was through the culture that binds and unites us all that the truth will find its way.
2456	50	"The notorious culture of cancellation"" has turned into ""cancellation of culture"". Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Rakhmaninov are excluded from concert posters. Russian writers and their books are also banned. The last time such a mass campaign to destroy objectionable literature was carried out by the Nazis in Germany almost 90 years ago.

2459	4	"The former head of the British government Gordon Brown, in his words, ""never had any illusions about what Putin was like."" The politician shared his memories of his visit to Moscow in 2006, when he was put on a ""very low chair."" Speaking about recent events, Brown criticized the global disunity on the issue of sanctions against the Russian Federation. He claims that the Russian president allegedly ""reacts only to an uncompromising show of force."" Read more in the article ""Gazety.Ru""."
2459	6	Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke in an interview with The Telegraph about his visit to Moscow back in 2006. In particular, he recalled how in the Kremlin he was then “forced to sit on a very low seat.”
2459	8	Brown also claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin allegedly threatened him. “I had no illusions about what Putin was like,” said the ex-head of the British government.
2459	10	"According to him, for many years the West could not resist the President of the Russian Federation, until ""his invasion of Ukraine."" Brown also criticized global disunity, pointing out that 150 countries around the world have not imposed sanctions against Russia even after the start of a special military operation."
2459	12	"""Looking up at him"""
2459	14	Recalling his visit to the Kremlin in 2006, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Brown said he was placed in a very low seat.
2459	16	“So I looked up to Putin. He's a relatively short man, of course, and he wears those high heels.
2459	18	That day, he took out those index cards and began to read all the information he had about me, as if he wanted to prove that he knew more about me than I knew about myself. Therefore, when people say that Putin has changed and is only now threatening, I can tell you that he threatened me even then, ”said the former head of the British Cabinet.
2459	20	"""Opportunist to the nth degree"""
2459	22	"Brown believes that Putin only reacts to ""an uncompromising and unwavering show of force"":"
2459	24	“The only thing Putin understands is strength. Weakness he will use. He is an opportunist to the nth degree, ”says the former British prime minister.
2459	26	Western inaction on the “Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014,” which took place when David Cameron was prime minister, “left Putin to think he could get away with further invasions,” he said.
2459	28	Global disunity
2459	30	"In addition, Brown welcomed the ""unity of NATO"", but at the same time pointed out the problem with the coordination of sanctions."
2459	32	“What we also saw is global disunity: 82 countries refuse to support actions against Russia for violating human rights and freedoms, 150 states do not impose sanctions,” he stated.
2459	34	Brown suggested that one of the reasons for this state of affairs was the inability of the West to solve the problem of global poverty.
2459	36	“One of the reasons is that we have not shown people that Western-led globalization is about reducing poverty, improving living standards and of course fighting climate change in poorer countries, and we really need to implement their promises,” concluded the former Prime Minister of Great Britain.
2459	38	Zelensky in a T-shirt angered the French
2459	40	Against this background, Le Figaro readers were outraged by the behavior and appearance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during negotiations with French leader Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
2461	3	According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the West African strain of the monkeypox pathogen was introduced from Nigeria, where the United States has located its biolaboratories.
2461	5	At least four US-controlled biological laboratories are operating in Nigeria, where monkeypox originated, Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops (RCBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces, said on May 27.
2461	7	This strange coincidence, in his opinion, requires additional verification of specialists, writes TASS.
2461	8	- So, according to European and American media, - the speaker continued, - in the materials of the Munich Security Conference 2021, that is, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, a scenario was worked out to counter an outbreak caused by a new strain of the monkeypox virus.
2461	10	Thus, Russia calls on the WHO leadership to investigate the activities of American laboratories operating in Nigerian cities.
2469	3	June 20 is World Refugee Day. Today Ukrainian refugees are in the center of attention. What impact did the flow of migrants have on most countries, including Russia?
2469	5	Today, June 20, is World Refugee Day. Now this topic has a global scale: Ukrainian refugees are in the spotlight.
2469	7	Co-chairman of the National Strategy Council, political scientist Iosif Diskin, in a conversation with Baltnews, explained the impact of the flow of Ukrainian refugees on the situation in the world, including in the Russian Federation.
2469	9	"""Three models [of the behavior of Ukrainian refugees] are being identified. First: the Polish model, where they use another portion of migrants as a cheap force. Second: the Anglo-French annoying freeloaders. Public discontent is growing. The third model of fraternal care is Russian. I do not want to idealize the situation, there is rather unpleasant excesses, but in general, the Russian state is coping with more than a million refugees. They are looking for work, they are helped and supported,"" the expert said."
2469	11	At the same time, as Diskin noted, some believe that after the completion of the special operation, the refugees will return to Ukraine in safe conditions, and the second part will integrate into Russian society and the economy. If we count in half, then this closes the demographic losses of Russia over the past year.
2469	13	Refugees do not want to return to Western Europe: they cling with their hands, feet, teeth, so as not to return there. It is assumed that they should receive benefits, while the states, on the contrary, are trying to push them out. People came from under the bombing, from under the shelling. Relatives, work, friends, acquaintances remained there, but here everything needs to be built anew,” the political scientist continued, adding that someone quickly adapts, and someone wants to return to their native environment.
2469	15	"""Russia will do everything to quickly restore those cities that were badly damaged in the conditions of hostilities. A vivid example is Mariupol, where prefabricated houses are being built so that people can wait until major repairs are carried out in the buildings of the city,"" Diskin stated. ."
2469	17	In May, the UN published data on the number of Ukrainian refugees. Thus, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that since the beginning of the special operation, more than 6.73 million people have left the country. It is noted that most of the citizens left for Poland: 3,581,612 refugees. 989,357 Ukrainians arrived in Romania, 971,417 arrived in Russia, and 671,463 arrived in Hungary.
2469	19	Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Prosecutor General's Office to help refugees from Donbass and Ukraine:
2469	21	Particular attention should be paid to those people who arrive in Russia from Ukraine, from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Today [by mid-April] there are already about a million of them, including over a hundred thousand children. People who have been forced to leave their homes do not always have with them the documents necessary to receive material assistance, medical support, and to place their children in schools and kindergartens. I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to provide people with legal assistance, protect their rights, including considering the appeals of the victims as soon as possible. People are having a hard time, help them.
247	1	In the US, Zelensky was called a comic dictator
247	3	American propaganda shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a favorable light, inspiring US citizens with ideas about the heroism of the Kyiv authorities, said Terry Titcomb, a columnist for The American Thinker.
247	5	Titcomb stressed that Zelensky is actually a comedian who won the election with a pacifist agenda, but then turned into a dictator supported by the oligarchs.
247	7	According to the observer, the United States is sowing conflicts in different parts of the globe in order to make money on this, and is broadcasting false propaganda theses to Americans. The author of the article noted that Pentagon spokesman John Kirby never spoke at briefings about the suffering that the residents of the DPR and LPR were forced to endure from Kyiv.
247	9	Titcomb questioned why Kirby had been silent for the past eight years, during which the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the Donbass and killed thousands of civilians. And where were the tears of the Pentagon press secretary when Ukrainians burned a group of protesters in Odessa in 2014, the journalist asked.
2473	3	The victory of Gustavo Petro in the presidential elections in Colombia will have a positive impact on the trial for the release of Russian Sergei Vagin, said human rights activist, head of the CST command Artemy Semenovsky.
2473	5	"In an exclusive interview with the head of the Foundation for the Fight against Repressions (FBI), created by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, Mira Terada, the expert noted that after Petro's victory in Colombia, the West lost the sense of spinning unreliable information about some kind of ""Russian interference"" in the electoral process. Initially, they tried to portray Sergei Vagin as a person who financed the protests, was engaged in espionage activities, and was even almost connected with the Iranian Hezbollah. This whole situation was created for a flurry of fake Western media articles about ""Putin's insidious hand."""
2473	7	Now, accusations against the Russian are brought only on issues of financial fraud and illegal access to computer information. Due to the irrelevance of the West's agenda, Sergey's defenders hope that these charges will also be dropped.
2473	9	“CST command has already sent congratulations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia on the election of Gustavo Petro, where we expressed the hope that the change in the political climate in Colombia will lead to the removal of biased and politically motivated charges against Sergei Vagin and Colombian justice will show true independence and objectivity,” — Semenovsky noted.
2473	11	Now Sergei needs high-quality protection for his release, which is why a fundraiser was announced that will be sent to lawyers.
2475	1	In the Leningrad region developed a plan for the decarbonization of the region
2475	3	St. Petersburg, June 21 - RIA Novosti. The authorities of the Leningrad region have developed a draft plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the region's economy for the next 18 years, a spokesman for the regional administration told RIA Novosti.
2475	4	According to him, the draft plan was presented at a meeting with executive authorities.
2475	5	It is important to continue this work, despite the fact that the situation is difficult now, times are changing, and the topic of decarbonization will remain, and many countries where products from the Leningrad Region are sent are interested in it. We must identify the areas where we can most painlessly reduce our carbon footprint. First of all, this is an increase in forest plantations - it is necessary to use reserve lands, disturbed agricultural lands for planting forests with subsequent transfer to forestry lands, change the system of boiler houses, introduce the processing of agricultural waste, develop transport on gas and electricity, build renewable energy sources and connect to them , first of all, companies working for export,” said Alexander Drozdenko, Governor of the Leningrad Region.
2475	6	The regional administration clarified that, in the field of electricity and heat supply, fuel in boiler houses is expected to be replaced with a less carbon-intensive one, reducing heat consumption by improving the energy efficiency of houses, and building wind farms. In transport, the use of alternative fuels and the promotion of the transfer of transport to gas and electricity. As well as the creation of carbon-free zones for the introduction of technologies with low greenhouse gas emissions, the reduction of MSW volumes sent for disposal by creating additional processing facilities, the introduction of active degassing systems at landfills planned for closure, and others.
2479	3	There is good news, friends. The world is not in danger of starvation. Such that hunger-hunger, directly an epidemic with horrific consequences, - writes Yaroslav Romanchuk. — This follows from the latest OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031. It is jointly produced by the OECD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
2479	5	According to the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), there are enough grains and other agricultural raw materials in the world, although in 2022. agricultural prices have risen markedly.
2479	7	In March 2022, the FAO Food Price Index was at its highest level since 1990. In April, it decreased, but is still 30% higher than the same period in 2021.
2479	10	<<The war in Ukraine is the biggest factor of uncertainty. The complete loss of the Ukrainian export potential of wheat would lead to an increase in world prices by 19%.>>
2479	12	If the same thing happened to Russia at the same time, then prices would rise by 34% compared to the situation without the war. In this scenario, Ukraine and Russia would export 36 million tons less wheat, and other countries would increase their exports of wheat by 16 million tons, because its prices would be significantly higher.
2479	14	The OECD notes the role and importance of the warring parties in agricultural production. If we take the average figures for the last five seasons, then Russia produced 10%, Ukraine - 3% of the world's wheat. Russia was the world's first exporter of wheat (20% of world exports), Ukraine was the fifth (10% of world exports). Russia and Ukraine produce 20% of the world's barley, are the third and fourth exporters in the world.
2479	16	Ukraine is the world's largest producer of sunflower seeds. Next comes Russia. Together, countries produce more than half of this product in the world. Ukraine is the world's fourth largest exporter of vegetable oil. Ukraine is also the third largest exporter of corn and rapeseed. In addition, Ukraine is the largest exporter of soybeans, except for South and North America.
2479	18	Today, ~4.9 billion hectares of land are used for agricultural production in the world, of which ~1.6 billion are used for cereals. For comparison: in 1950, 3.84 billion hectares were used (for grains there were 1.22 billion).
2479	20	In the world, about half of the land suitable for life (global habitable land) is used for agricultural production: in China - 56%, Russia - 13.2%, Ukraine - 71.3%, Poland - 47.4%, Germany - 47.6 %, Italy - 41.7%, France - 52.3%, Spain - 52.4%, USA - 44.4%, Canada - 6.5%, Brazil - 28.3%, Argentina - 54.4% , Peru - 18.4%, India - 60.4%, Turkey - 49.1%.
2479	22	The decrease in the supply of almost any agricultural raw material, product at the current level of agricultural technology, the availability of unused resources for agricultural production is solely a consequence of government decisions, i.e. stewards of someone else's different countries. The grain yield today is such that, compared with 1961, only 30% of the land is needed to obtain the same volume of production.
2479	24	Unfortunately, first of all, the developed countries continue to work in the regime of strict agrarian protectionism, quotas, tariffs and many non-tariff restrictions.
2479	26	If the market for agricultural products were truly free, then food prices would be many times lower, and residents of poor countries would spend on food not 40-50% of their income, but 10-15%. Therefore, the main tool for eliminating hunger and reducing food prices in the world is the transition from a regime that is beneficial for the agro-barons of all countries to a free market regime.
2479	28	In a free market, households would have $4-6 trillion in hand for manufactured goods and a variety of services. Today, we, consumers, are forced to overpay such huge sums of money for the fact that officials and agrarian barons together impose on us a hundred-year-old agrarian policy.
2482	1	I.N. Mikheev. IF TODAY WE LOSE NOVOROSSIYA, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP EURASIA. Part 1.
2482	3	The statement that Asia is gradually becoming the main center of the world economy and the fate of the world will be decided in Asia in the foreseeable future can be considered a truism. The economies of East, South-East and South Asia, the largest of which: China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, already today provide, taking into account purchasing power parity (PPP), 40% of world GDP. The share of India, for example, in world GDP, taking into account PPP, is 8%. This is more than Germany, England and France combined. They only have 7.5%. The share of China is 20%. Moreover, the GDP of Asian countries is generated in the real sector of the economy, where real material values ​​are created. Whereas a significant part of the GDP of the West arises in a completely ephemeral service sector.
2482	5	The main geopolitical players and all interested parties who expect to remain in the 21st century subjects of world history, and not objects of foreign manipulations and interests, are gradually transferring their assets to Asia. Take, for example, the modern financial Typhon, the largest private bank in the world (its assets amount to $ 4 trillion) - the central banks of most countries of the world are pygmies compared to it, the largest and most global accumulator of financial assets in the world today, with more than 10 thousand assets. offices in 90 countries - Hong Kong-Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). So, HSBC holds twice as many assets in Asia as in the US. Being registered in England, HSBC's main operating centers are located in Asia - to Chinese Guangzhou, in Indian Hyderabad and Pune, in Malaysia and the Philippines. Why I took HSBC, the flagship of the Rothschild financial group, as an example. These people know how to count and know how to calculate ahead. If they go somewhere with their money, there is no doubt that it is there that the main and most interesting events will unfold.
2482	7	"In terms of exports and imports, Russia will also have to gradually reorient itself towards Asian markets. But with what will the Russian Federation come to them? Again with cheap natural gas? With crude oil? With round timber and prostitutes? In the familiar image of ""Upper Volta with rockets""? I doubt that future generations, left bare-assed in the Siberian frosts - without natural resources pumped out of the depths by the current compradors, will thank us for this stupid economic strategy worthy of the Papuans: to exchange gold (non-renewable natural resources) for glass beads."
2482	9	The place of Russia in the world division of labor, in the world commodity exchange should be determined by its real capabilities and resources. Namely, the ability to generate large amounts of energy, reserves of ores rich in useful components and other mineral raw materials. But in order to be a worthy participant in the global commodity exchange, Russia must enter the world markets not directly with metals and minerals, as is the case today, but with energy-intensive, metal-intensive, mineral-intensive and science-intensive high-tech products. These are the products of the chemical industry that uses mineral raw materials, products of mechanical engineering, in particular machine tool building, shipbuilding, aircraft building, rocket building, turbine building, and high-speed ground transport. However, this raises the problem of cost and competitiveness.
2482	11	In small series and in single copies, machines in the broadest sense and machine tools can be produced in different regions. For example, it is quite cost-effective to assemble Soyuz-2 launch vehicles in Samara, where the average annual temperature is +5.6. But for the cost price, therefore, for the competitiveness of products that are assembled on a conveyor, on slipways, energy costs per unit of production, the cost of labor - labor, as well as transportation costs for delivery to the place of production of raw materials and components and delivery of finished products to the consumer are critical.
2482	13	Today there is talk about the creation of industrial centers in Siberia - closer to the Siberian and Ural raw material bases and to the Asian markets. In itself, the idea of ​​developing Siberia and reindustrialization is certainly correct and timely, it can only be welcomed. But here you need to understand that Russia's ability to create industrial clusters, competitive production in the field of mechanical engineering or the chemical industry in Siberia and the Far East is limited by climatic conditions. The main limiters will be the shortage of labor resources and the high cost of creating infrastructure for people's lives. As you know, the fish is looking for where it is deeper, and the person, where the climatic conditions are better. It is no coincidence that the climate factor has the largest share in the calculation of the quality of life index - the quality-of-life index. Not the average income per capita, not the availability of jobs, not security, but the climate. And it is no coincidence that the Russian Federation is in 72nd place in the mentioned index out of 80 accounting countries - noticeably lower than Colombia, Venezuela, El Salvador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, etc.
2482	15	The climate is a natural limiter for the development of the industry. What can we say about Siberia, even if in the Leningrad region with its relatively mild Atlantic-continental winter, interested investors, after studying all aspects of the business, often refuse to place production facilities, invest in fixed assets, because there simply are not enough workers in this territory. The population density of the Leningrad region is 22 people. per sq. km. In order not to experience a shortage of workers and technical engineering personnel, at least 40-50 are needed. The population density of the Khabarovsk Territory is 1.8 people. In the southern regions of the region, where Khabarovsk itself stands, there are 6 people per square meter. km.
2482	17	There are plenty of real-life examples in other countries as well. For example, in Finland, more than 80% of the population lives in the south and southwest of the country, on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and the western part of the Gulf of Finland, heated by the warm Gulf Stream. In the northern and eastern provinces bordering our Karelia, with a temperate continental climate, less than 20% of the population lives on a much larger territory. The government strives to maintain the population of the northern and northeastern provinces, but no benefits can force the Finns to move from the relatively comfortable southwest in terms of climatic conditions to the uncomfortable northeast.
2482	19	In the United States, anyone who wants to settle in the state of Alaska will be able to rent a large comfortable apartment in the center of the state capital, Anchorage, inexpensively. He will also receive a subsidy from the state to pay for the apartment. But the population of Anchorage, where the climate is noticeably milder than in our Khabarovsk, is the average January temperature, due to the influence of the warm Alaska Current, a branch of the North Pacific Current, minus 8.4 degrees, and so, the population of Anchorage is only 280 thousand. And the total population of the state total 730 thousand people. Despite the fact that the population of the United States is 340 million, no one wants to go to Alaska, although salaries are higher there.
2482	21	We see the same in Canada. Nearly 90% of Canadians live in the south of the country - within 100 miles of the US border. In the rest of vast Canada - its area is almost 10 million square meters. km - only 10% of the population lives. The resource-rich north of the country is uninhabited, although wages are noticeably higher there. The population density of the northern province of Nunavut is 0.01 people/sq. km. This province occupies 21% of the territory of Canada, its area is approximately equal to the area of ​​Indonesia - 2 million square meters. km. At the same time, only 40 thousand people live in the entire province of Nunavut, 270 million in Indonesia!
2482	23	The most striking and closest example is the experience of China. In the 90s, in Inner Mongolia - in the north of China, the Chinese found deposits of coal. A coal boom began - many mines were founded. To attract workers to the mines, large and convenient modern cities were built from scratch: Xishuan, Ordos, Kangbashi. Millions (!) of apartments - comparable to the number of apartments in all of Russia (64 million). With all the infrastructure - shopping centers, parks, large luxurious stadiums, museums. The Chinese are not sloppy. So, these cities are still uninhabited. There were no people wishing to go to live in the Ordos steppe and semi-desert, where the climate is continental, blown by cold northern winds. Although the average temperatures here are noticeably higher than in the Urals. January −10°С, July +23°С.
2482	25	The Chinese prefer to live in the south and on the east coast, where the climate is subtropical. It is easy to understand them - life expectancy in the southeastern and southern provinces is almost one and a half times longer than in Inner Mongolia and in the northern provinces. In Macau - the Chinese Las Vegas on the coast of the South China Sea, the population density is 21 thousand (!) People per square meter. km. In the northern and western provinces of China - 20-30 people. - a thousand times less! That's what the climate factor means. As a result, the mentioned new cities of resource-rich Inner Mongolia turned into ghost towns. Only tourists go there - to look at this fantastic sur - deserted megacities, and directors - to shoot science fiction on location.
2482	27	The creation and maintenance of infrastructure for the life of people in Siberia will cost much more than even in central Russia, not to mention the south. This will be a heavy burden on the budget. Attracting labor resources will be even more expensive. It is comfortable to live here for the indigenous peoples of the circumpolar ethnic group. But they are few in number and prefer other types of activity - in closer contact with the natural landscape, to which they have adapted over many centuries, rather than factory and factory work. It will be possible to offer people from other regions to live in an uncomfortable climate and engage in productive labor only by enticing them with a long ruble, which will affect the cost of production and its competitiveness. And most importantly, having accumulated money, people will still leave for warmer climes. Of course, separate industries close to the places of extraction of the raw materials used should be created in Siberia, but building and populating large new cities is a utopia.
2482	29	However, unfavorable climatic conditions, continental geography as a whole, does not at all mean the futility of the development of the industry in Russia.
2482	31	Significant territories of historical Russia are located in the temperate continental climate zone with relatively mild winters - the average January temperature is slightly below zero. The Russians began to actively develop these lands back in the 17th century - under Alexei Mikhailovich, they finally conquered it in the 18th century - under Catherine II. Suvorov, Rumyantsev, Ushakov, Potemkin - put their lives precisely on the reconquest of these lands. These are the basins of the Don and the Northern Donets, the Kuban, the Black Sea region. The historical name of the region is Novorossiya. It includes Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Nikolaev, Odessa regions of present-day Ukraine.
2482	33	Adjacent to Novorossiya and inseparable from it is Slobozhanshchina, with its center in Kharkov. A quarter of a million square kilometers that went after the collapse of the USSR to non-independent Ukrobander Ukraine and almost the same number remained in the Russian Federation.
2482	35	It is natural that the national economic complex of Russia was formed as a united one - the Ural-Siberian raw materials and the Ural and Novorossiysk industrial ones. But unlike the Urals, which has a sharply continental climate, the average January temperature is -13, -15, the average annual is +3, in Novorossia the average January temperature in different regions is from -2 to -5, the average annual is +10, +15. Energy consumption, therefore, the cost of industrial production is much lower. And the shoulder of transportation to the central part of the country and for export by sea is much shorter. Near ice-free Black Sea ports.
2482	37	It is no coincidence that at the end of the 19th century it was here - in the south-west of historical Russia, that our ancestors began to create the Novorossiysk industrial region, in particular the Donetsk-Kryvyi Rih industrial complex, which included the Russian Ruhr - Donbass, industrial centers in suburban Ukraine - in the Kharkiv region, as well as in Yekaterinoslav and in the Black Sea region - Odessa-Nikolaev. This circumstance, obviously, was taken into account by Pyotr Nikolaevich Savitsky, the creator of the concept for the development of the economic complex of Russia - the neighboring continental economy, known as Eurasianism.
2482	39	"Here I note that in the post-Soviet era, the Eurasian theme, or rather, the Eurasian rhetoric, became fashionable. What kind of rubbish is not served with Eurasian sauce. What is only Dugin's, more precisely, Tiriar's (Belgian Jean Thiriart's) idea of ​​""Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" - not just a perversion, but a direct antithesis of Eurasianism. In Kazan, the activists of the TOC, a Tatar organization with an anti-Russian nationalist extremist agenda, invented their own Turkic-Islamic Eurasianism in defiance of the Moscow-imperial one. In the 2000s, open supporters of Wahhabism labored in Niyazov's Eurasian Party in Kazan."
2482	41	"However, no one has a monopoly on the term ""Eurasianism"". Therefore, everyone is free to put any meaning into it - exactly in accordance with the legendary phrase of Peter I, who demanded that his newly minted senators speak at meetings of the Senate ""not according to the written word"", ""so that everyone's foolishness was visible."" But here I mean precisely classical Eurasianism. So, the core of classical Eurasianism is the economic doctrine of Savitsky. Actually, the economic paradigm of the development of the economic complex of Russia by Savitsky is classical Eurasianism. Ethnopsychology N.S. Trubetskoy and the concept of G.V. Vernadsky of the continuity of Russian statehood, Russian imperialism from the Mongol - Genghis Khan, this is just an appendage that gives classical Eurasianism volume, multidimensionality, the necessary integrity and academic respectability."
2482	43	It must be understood that the Slavic-Turkic symbiosis in the expanses of Eurasia arose not at all from the similarity of Slavic and Turkic ornaments, not from the exchange of dictionaries, not from conferences on the topic of Slavic-Turkic friendship and chewing gum, and not even from the predominance of the Slavs and some of the Turks - Turkic-Kipchaks of Y-chromosome haplogroups R1a, I and N1c. This symbiosis arose from the joint economic development of the Eurasian landscapes by the Slavs and the Turks, from the exchange of goods, from the combination of efforts to create an integral Eurasian national economic complex. It was in the process of developing joint economic practices that those ties arose, including cultural ones, that gave rise to the Slavic-Turkic syncret - the Russian superethnos, in Gumilyov's terminology.
2482	45	So, classical Eurasianism is a discourse not at all about the mythical “Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok”, not about the 10,000-kilometer bridge covered with legends between Europe and Asia. and not even about Russia's economic ties with the Central Asian countries that have emerged in the post-Soviet space. Although, of course, such ties need to be restored and developed. More precisely, Eurasianism is not about these connections in the first place. Russia's relations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and even more so with China, are not the essence of Eurasianism, not its core, but only an additional secondary component.
2482	47	Russia, even in its present territorially castrated form, remains Eurasia by itself. It is capable of implementing the Eurasian doctrine even if it has no Central Asian neighbors at all. Moreover, if you add up the GDP of the Central Asian states - members of the EAEU, then the entire gross amount will add less than 15% to the Russian GDP. That is, a new quality from the addition of the GDP of Russia and the Central Asian neighbors will not work in any way. But that's not the point. And that in the total volume, for example, of Kazakhstani exports, oil, gas and metals in value terms account for 90%. And Kazakhstan drives this raw material for processing not to Russia, but to China and Europe.
2482	49	However, Kazakhstan, no less ethno-Nazi than Ukraine, to which the great strategist Stalin, like a fur coat from a master's shoulder, presented southern Russian Siberia with all its riches, does not even export its raw materials, but only watches how Western and Chinese concessionaires do it . Nearly a hundred copper deposits, fifty zinc deposits, fifty lead, two dozen bauxites, rich hydrocarbon deposits, and facilities for the extraction of oil, gas, ores and the smelting of non-ferrous metal created in the USSR are now owned by Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni, Chinese CNPC. Actually, it was for this that the collapse of the USSR was carried out. It was to Western and Chinese corporations that the fake Eurasian Nazarbayev, a rare scoundrel, hastened to transfer all the natural resources of sovereign Kazakhstan on the second day after the liquidation of the USSR.
2482	51	At the forums and in the EAEU commissions, Kazakh representatives with a smart look talk about Eurasian integration, about uniform tariffs and technical regulations, and all the deposits explored by Russian geologists, all the goks and smelters built by Russian engineers and workers, on which Russians are mainly in Soviet times and worked, sovereign Kazakhstan gave, I repeat, to the Americans and the Chinese. Such hypocrisy, such meanness to look for. The mutual trade turnover between Russia and Kazakhstan is so small that if you look at the numbers, you get the impression that Russia and Kazakhstan are not the main participants in the common economic union - the EAEU, but are completely different. In Russia's foreign trade turnover in 2020, the share of Kazakhstan amounted to a little more than 3%, and in all previous years it was completely less than 3%! Well, who do we want to deceive with such ersatz-Eurasianism? Themselves?
2482	53	"So, the essence of Savitsky's classical Eurasianism lies not in the false friendship between Russia and its Central Asian neighbors, not in the supply of labor from Tajikistan to Moscow construction sites so that developers with a residence permit in Israel and the United States consistently receive their superprofits, and even more so the essence of classical Eurasianism not in ""Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" - this is exactly what Eurasianism firmly and resolutely denies, but in the creation of a neighboring continental economy. The content of this is in inter-regional and inter-regional production cooperation within Russia, in inter-regional and inter-regional commodity exchange. Savitsky justified this need by the weak competitiveness of Russian goods in the world commodity markets due to increased transport costs. For my part, I would add that an even more important factor in terms of reducing the competitiveness of Russian goods is high energy costs due to the sharply continental climate. A. Parshev brilliantly wrote about this in the well-known book Why Russia is not America."
2482	55	In this regard, interregional and interregional cooperation and commodity exchange become possible only when the customs borders for the export of Russian raw materials and the import of finished products are covered, if not tightly, but in such a way that mineral raw materials, minerals, which Russia is rich in, are processed and the final high-tech the product was produced domestically. At the same time, I will add, for my part, it is logical that raw materials mined in regions with a cold, sharply continental climate go to a region where more favorable climatic conditions make it possible to reduce energy costs per unit of production, hence its cost, and produce competitive products, which, the domestic market will prefer imports, and which can be supplied to foreign markets.
2482	57	In other words, the neighborhood economy is a semi-autarkic economy. It would seem that it could be simpler and more banal - even Mendeleev spoke about this. But Savitsky has not just words, he proved with numbers and calculations in his hands that there is no alternative to the neighboring economy. Either a continental neighboring economy with half-hidden customs, or Russia is turning into a raw-material colony of more successful economies that have a priori geographical advantages over the Russian one. Let me note that Savitsky's autarchy and covered customs do not mean at all that if we live in the north, we should eat exclusively turnips, rutabaga and white cabbage, and fundamentally refuse bananas and watermelons. They only mean that we must grow our own watermelons - in Astrakhan. And not to import them by ship from West African Mali, as is the case today.
2482	59	Savitsky himself, after serving 11 years - from 1945 to 1956. in camps and prisons, died in exile, but his concept was implemented in the USSR. In the USSR, in the 20th century, it was precisely the continental neighboring economy that was created. It would seem a paradox: the main theoretician of Eurasianism is sitting in Stalin's camps, while his economic program is being fully implemented in the country, and Stalin is the main Eurasian practitioner. Of course, in terms of institutional relations, in the sense of property relations, the economy of the USSR was far from the ideals of Eurasianism. Savitsky did not at all propose to de-peasant the country - to take away land from small commodity producers, turn them into powerless slaves without passports and establish collective farms, to which the wise district committees of the party will indicate when to sow and when to reap. But here are the key macroeconomic principles of the organization of the national economy - its structure, its balance sheets, its differentiation, that is, division according to the sectoral and territorial principle, its inter-sectoral and inter-regional ties and, most importantly, its ultimate goal - the preservation of the country's economic sovereignty in the USSR were precisely Eurasian.
2482	61	However, there is no paradox here. The fact is that both Savitsky's economic theory and Stalin's economic practice reflected objective reality - its inexorable circumstances. Savitsky comprehensively studied them, comprehended, rationalized and objectified in the form of a scientific paradigm. Stalin grasped them intuitively and used them in practice. It was not at all Stalin’s voluntarism and ideological chimeras, but objective geographical and economic reasons that determined the semi-autarkic nature of the development of the national economy in the USSR with a focus on the domestic market and the market of neighboring continental countries, in spite of the openness of the global economy, which 30 years has been imposing on the world, Russia in particular, West and homegrown Russian compradors.
2482	63	". After the development of the oil and gas fields of Siberia in the Soviet era, its resources were not transported to the West and China, as they are today, but were connected with the industrial potential of the southern regions of historical Russia, which, after the collapse of the USSR, began to misunderstand to be called the ""East of Ukraine"", but the authentic primordial whose name is Novorossiya. It was as a result of such a connection that the real Eurasian Union - the USSR became the second economy in the world. The USSR economy accounted for 20% (!) of world industrial production. About as much as China has today. Moreover, the volume of foreign trade of the USSR in the late 80s was less than 7% percent of its GDP."
2482	65	In the 90s, the new elite was a bunch of small (in essence, but not on the scale of the stolen), mostly Moscow gesheftmachers, in a hurry to plunder natural resources and line their pockets, infantile enthusiasts of the free global market and conscious pests from the fifth column, who called themselves reformers, the continental neighbor the economy that gave birth to the grandiose Soviet industry was completely destroyed. Acting under the guidance of their Washington and Brussels curators, they began to play by someone else's rules - the rules of the Western financial oligarchy that controls global exchange. And very soon -
2482	67	in just a few years, they turned Russia into a raw materials colony of the European Union.
2482	69	Now also China. When you look at the shameless advertising of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, through which natural gas is driven to China, a completely different lexeme comes to mind: the power of stupidity and greed.
2482	71	Here, by the way, the prophetic genius of Savitsky manifested itself once again. Savitsky warned back in the 20s of the last century that if Russia integrates into the global economy created by the West without taking into account the geographical position that lowers the competitiveness of its goods, it will very quickly lose financial sovereignty and become financially dependent on more economically developed countries. And in economic terms, it will turn into a raw material colony - into a country of monoculture. That is, it will supply the world commodity markets with that monoculture, which is especially rich and which the masters of the global economy will prescribe for it.
2482	73	For my part, I note that this circumstance means at least a partial loss of political sovereignty. The fact is that the country of monoculture, firstly, is entirely dependent on counterparties - buyers of the monoculture produced by it - which these counterparties can use to exert political pressure. Secondly, the focus on monoculture causes a weak differentiation of the country's economy, and this automatically leads to dependence on imports of critically important goods - food, etc. exchange Western oligarchy prices.
2482	75	At that time, the oil and gas fields of Siberia had not yet been explored. But Savitsky looked into the water. A century later, American wits pejoratively call Russia a gas station. McCain is a gas station disguised as a country, Biden is a gas station with nuclear missiles. And they have quite convincing reasons for such witticisms - just look at the structure of Russian exports. Hydrocarbons have become a monoculture for Russia.
2482	77	In 2021, gas was sold to Europe under the notorious long-term contracts at two hundred dollars per thousand cubic meters, while the market price in Europe and Asia is more than a thousand dollars, and even reached 2 thousand. That is, they gave it as a gift. Is it possible to imagine that Germany, with a market value of 60 thousand euros for Mercedes, supplies them to Russia for 10 thousand? Moreover, under long-term contracts. Under the pretext of preserving the Russian market and with loud assurances that she, Germany, is a reliable supplier of Mercedes to Russia at a price ten times lower than the market price at all times.
2482	79	Everything, as Savitsky promised, is that the country of monoculture is forced to give away its natural resources, in fact, for next to nothing. Although there is a dime a dozen speculations about Eurasianism today, never in history has Russia been so far from the Eurasian ideal, Eurasian goals and objectives, as it is today. We are not even a gas station - in terms of the production of high-octane gasoline, we are far from among the world leaders - we are just two large parallel pipes - oil and gas. Suffice it to recall that the depth of oil refining in Russia is less than in Africa - where to go further. This is what it means to give away natural resources to compradors, both private sharashkas like Lukoil and state compradors like Rosneft.
2482	81	"However, the beginning of this degradation from a superpower to a gas station was laid under Brezhnev. And it was connected with the famous project ""gas in exchange for pipes."" Then the rapidly bourgeois elite of the USSR discovered that it was much easier and more pleasant to pump oil and gas to Europe, to Germany, receiving hard currency and buying fashionable consumer goods for it in the same Europe, than to engage in painstaking Egyptian work to develop and tune the mechanism of the country's economic complex. Sit on the pipe - dangle your feet. But as our observant ancestors also noticed: the claw is stuck, the whole bird is abyss. In 1991, the bird named USSR eventually disappeared. This is what gas turned out to be in exchange for gum and Pepsi-Cola. And all because the comprador economy, based on the export of raw materials, has as a consequence not only the deprivation of the resources of future generations. Another evil that the comprador economy generates is that it corrupts the ruling class and lumpenizes the population, which, without a developed industrial infrastructure, without jobs in the sphere of productive labor, is out of work and is rapidly degrading in all literally respects."
2482	83	However, the political situation and the stupidity of the elites can in no way cancel geography and geophysics. And it cannot cancel purely economic reasons. In order to remain competitive, the production of serial products of mechanical engineering, machine tool building and more widely, of any mass product, must be located in regions with a favorable climate that causes low energy costs per unit of output, with a short arm for the most economical - sea transportation of raw materials, components, finished products and with sufficient labor resources. There is only one such region in historical Russia - Novorossiya.
2482	85	Novorossiya is a unique region. Both climatically and geographically - non-freezing ports are located at a small distance. For two centuries, our ancestors created a developed industrial infrastructure here. GDP in the era of the USSR was created here not due to the plundering of mineral resources and the sale of raw materials to Europe and China, but due to productive labor and the creation of added value. Per capita GDP in Novorossiya has always been higher than in other regions of historical Russia. At the same time, GDP was created in the real sector, and not in the service sector and financial speculation - as in Moscow, which profits from the fact that it resells money bought from European banks on the expensive Russian credit market. Novorossians worked in mines, at blast furnaces and at machine tools, they produced real material values. Novorossiya has always been the locomotive of both the Russian imperial and Soviet economies.
2482	87	Let's take Dnepropetrovsk, now the Dnieper region, as an example. Yekaterinoslav - the true name of the city - was founded under Catherine the Great by Potemkin as the southern capital of Russia. Not Kyiv was planned as the southern capital, but the Novorossiysk Yekaterinoslav. And it is by no means accidental. There is a rare variety of mineral deposits here. To date, 302 explored deposits. 40 types of mineral raw materials are mined. Iron ore reserves are 15 billion tons - the volume of production before Maidan is 87 million per year. manganese ores. Talco-magnesite. The kaolin deposit is the best in the world in terms of reserves and quality of raw materials. The balance reserves of hard and brown coal are 21 billion tons. Gold, molybdenum, tungsten, uranium, and rare earth metals have been explored. And this richest raw material base is supplemented by the powerful industrial potential created by our grandfathers: 587 industrial enterprises in 15 industries, including gold mining, 950 ore occurrences, a mining and metallurgical complex of 57 enterprises, 3 coking plants, a ferroalloy plant. 4 pipe factories - produce 40 thousand pipe sizes from 400 steel grades, pipes made of brass, aluminum, titanium, zirconium. Export to 40 countries. Power industry: Prydniprovska and Krivoy Rog thermal power plants with a total capacity of 4.7 thousand MW, Dneprodzerzhinsk (now Kamenskaya) hydroelectric power station. Nature: 15 deposits of mineral waters, formed on the watersheds of the soil of the chernozem type. All types of agricultural crops are grown.
2482	89	This is only one of the 7 regions of Novorossia, now in the hands of the Ukrobanderites. None of the Russian regions up to the Urals can be compared with it in terms of wealth of minerals, minerals and, at the same time, industrial potential. Yuzhmash alone is worth something - it produced the entire line of missiles in the USSR, ranging from tactical to space, including intercontinental ballistic ones.
2482	91	And in quantities more than providing parity with the US and NATO. And let's say, Slobozhanshchina, adjacent to Novorossia, with its center in Kharkov, occupied the first places in many types of industrial products both in pre-revolutionary Russia and in the USSR. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were already over 900 industrial enterprises. The largest ones are in metalworking and transport engineering. In the USSR, Kharkov was the country's largest center of tractor, tank and turbine building. And at the same time the largest transport hub.
2482	93	It is also important that the South of historical Russia is not only its industrial center, but also its scientific and technological center. Here, new technologies were generated on their own scientific and technological base in the Soviet period. Kharkov, for example, in the USSR was the 3rd largest R&D center after Moscow and Leningrad
2482	95	And what is the Nikolaevsky shipbuilding plant worth! In the USSR, he built the entire line of ships - both civilian, including large tankers and bulk carriers, and military, including aircraft carriers. Thanks to the Novorossiysk shipbuilders, the USSR had a serious aircraft carrier fleet - 5 aircraft carriers in service and two under construction. Today there is, in fact, none. Even modern BDK - landing ships in the Russian Navy is in short supply. Those that are in service were built in the 60s of the last century. As a result, even a local operation to occupy one unfortunate Odessa is delayed - there are not enough technical means to ensure hostilities.
2492	3	BEIJING, July 8 - RIA Novosti. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced his upcoming resignation the day before, served the interests of the United States often to the detriment of the interests of the British people, he actually destroyed London's relations with China and Russia, his departure is favorable for everyone, Gao Zhikai, a professor at Suzhou University, told RIA Novosti on Friday.
2492	4	Boris Johnson, who succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in 2019, announced on Thursday that he is stepping down as prime minister and head of the UK's Conservative Party, and will remain in office until a new prime minister is appointed. At the same time, there are calls from different sides that he should already leave his post.
2492	6	In the past two-plus years, Johnson has ignored the national interests of Britain, completely abandoned an independent foreign policy and was ready to voluntarily become a lackey of the United States, sacrificing London's independent foreign policy and the ability to make decisions independently. From this point of view, this (Johnson's departure from the post of prime minister - ed.) is good for the UK itself, for China, Russia and the EU, it is good even for world peace, - said Gao Zhikai.
2492	8	He noted that, for example, after the start of a special military operation in Ukraine, Johnson consistently adhered to extremely harsh anti-Russian rhetoric, shouted about the need for military action and the continuous escalation of the conflict, and also called for the destruction and split of Russia.
2492	10	"The analyst added that Johnson had recently visited Ukraine twice, and at that time he was worried about various internal problems, and the crisis inside the UK was already quite serious, “he tried to use the conflict in Ukraine to make himself a defender of Ukraine, to divert attention from problems in his own country."""
2492	11	In other words, he is not really concerned about the life and death of the inhabitants of Ukraine, not the stability of Ukraine, not how to resolve the conflict in Ukraine peacefully, but only his personal interests, - added Gao Zhikai.
2492	13	"Speaking about Johnson's role in the development of relations between Britain and China, Gao Zhikai said that ""Johnson sold his soul and body to the United States, he was ready to serve as Washington's bouncer and provoke China to the extreme on many issues, especially Taiwan, as a result of which relations freezing point between Beijing and London."""
2492	14	He added that Johnson had effectively destroyed Britain's diplomatic relations with Russia and China, and all of his actions are completely contrary to the fundamental interests of the British people.
2492	15	Going forward, the analyst pointed out, everything depends on whether the new British prime minister can put the interests of the British people first instead of defending the interests of the United States, following Washington and being his henchman.
2492	17	The next Prime Minister of Great Britain has an extremely difficult task, because now the country is experiencing inflation, energy shortages and a serious financial crisis. From this point of view, they must begin to act as quickly as possible, and most importantly, to improve relations with Russia. Because without Russia there can be no lasting peace either in Europe or in the world, he believes.
2494	1	In the United States, Kyiv's statements about an imminent victory were called fiction
2494	3	MOSCOW, July 8/ Radio Sputnik. Statements by Ukrainian leaders about an imminent victory in the confrontation with Russia are increasingly looking like science fiction, says columnist for the American Foreign Affairs magazine Barry Posen.
2494	4	The author noted that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict.
2494	5	"However, the Russian army is too strong to allow Kyiv ""to negate its achievements in the Donbass,"" the journalist is sure. He also stressed that Europeans and Americans, suffering from the consequences of anti-Russian sanctions, may run out of patience. Against this background, Western support will become ""less generous,"" Posen said."
2494	7	As a result, the West will be forced to agree to the easing of restrictions, and NATO will have to start negotiations with Russia aimed at finding ways to de-escalate, Posen concluded.
2495	3	"Volodymyr Zelensky's statement that the conflict in Ukraine ""will end before the end of the year"" if powerful weapons from partners ""arrive on time,"" political analyst Yuriy Kot commented on Sputnik radio."
2495	5	"Volodymyr Zelensky, in an interview with CNN, again called on Western countries to help Kyiv with weapons. According to Zelensky, the ""military part"" of the conflict with Russia can be ""stopped before the end of this year"" if ""powerful weapons from our partners come to us in time."""
2495	7	On the air of Sputnik radio, political scientist, Dean of the Faculty of Media Communications of the Moscow State Institute of Cinematography Yuriy Kot expressed the opinion that Zelensky is trying to cheer up his partners in the West.
2495	9	<<Zelensky is trying to cheer up his partners, who have clearly begun to turn sour, tired of this whole story, especially since Ukraine has no obvious successes at the front. On the one hand, he tries to build a Brave tailor out of himself, on the other hand, everyone can see perfectly well that his eyes are sad - with such eyes, as they say, you can’t sell an elephant. Therefore, in my opinion, there is no point in taking these words seriously. Especially after the collapse event for Kyiv - the departure of Zelensky's personal patron and all the Russophobic evil spirits in Ukraine, Boris Johnson, from the post of British Prime Minister. Until there is a new prime minister, a lot of time will pass. In addition, there are more and more voices in Europe about why to support Ukraine, all this is pointless>>, said Yuriy Kot.
2495	11	According to him, Europe is trying to encourage Zelensky to negotiate.
2495	13	<<To ensure that he sat down at the negotiating table and negotiated. There are voices that Ukraine cannot avoid the loss of territories, and it is better to agree now, while a small part is lost. Zelensky hopes that there will be more weapons so that by the fall they can come out with some victories and sit down at the negotiating table not to sign a surrender, but sort of like a strong side. But all these are insinuations, there is nothing serious behind this>>, the political scientist believes.
2496	1	Peskov: Russia does not use gas and oil as a political weapon
2496	3	MOSCOW, July 8/ Radio Sputnik. Russia denies accusations of using gas as a weapon of political pressure and is capable of guaranteeing the complete energy security of Europe, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
2496	5	<<We completely reject any hints or direct statements that the Russian side is using gas or oil as a weapon of political pressure. This is not true. Russia is consistently fulfilling all its obligations, and Russia is still able to guarantee the full energy security of Europe. And Russia is able to guarantee the absence of sky-high bills for electricity and heat, which taxpayers in European countries are now receiving>>, RIA Novosti quotes Peskov.
2496	7	He also commented on the statement by President Vladimir Putin about the incommensurability of the potentials of Russia and Ukraine, which he made the day before at a meeting with the leaders of the State Duma factions.
2496	9	<<No, I will not send you to the Ministry of Defense this time. These are indeed the words of the head of state. But the head of state just operated on those statements that are heard from Western countries, from Kyiv that, they say, Kyiv will move on the battlefield until victory. But here again, Putin thus simply reminded that the potentials are completely incommensurable, and Russia's potential is so great in this regard that only an insignificant part of it is now being used in the course of a special military operation. And that is why all these statements of Westerners are literally absurd, they are absurd, and they simply add grief to the Ukrainian people. What President Putin also said yesterday>>,” Peskov said.
2498	3	Ukraine may disappear from the world map if you continue to supply it with weapons, former adviser to the US Secretary of Defense Colonel Douglas McGregor said on Sky News Australia.
2498	5	He criticized the military assistance to Kyiv from the countries of the collective West, in particular Australia, and stressed that they should have contributed to a peaceful resolution of the situation, otherwise Ukraine would face destruction and death.
2498	7	“This is already, in principle, a failed state, it can completely disappear from the world map. I think a ceasefire is needed. Australia should push for it, because no one in Washington will go for it. But from people in Berlin, Paris and London, I hear of growing support for just this one idea - a ceasefire - and coming to some kind of agreement. Because we cannot afford to fight to the last Ukrainian,” McGregor explained.
2498	9	Earlier it became known that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised to provide Ukraine with 14 armored personnel carriers, 20 Bushmaster armored vehicles and several drones. Interestingly, Australia stands out for something here, that McGregor focuses on it?
2498	11	But the most interesting thing here, of course, is the position of the United States. Are they ready to accept not only the defeat of Ukraine (some American experts and politicians are already talking about this with might and main), but also the liquidation of its statehood? Or is it a private opinion?
2498	13	Maybe in the US they began to suspect something?
2498	15	“This American military expert has become a real star of the Russian social and political media in recent months,” says political scientist, head of the Open Analytics project Roman Travin.
2498	17	- He often comes out with sharp criticism of the actions of the United States in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government itself and the army, gives pessimistic forecasts for Washington, Brussels and Kyiv on the development of the conflict, both in its current format and in the event of its significant expansion. That is, he did not suddenly, under the influence of some new input, change his mind about what was happening, but initially he assessed the situation approximately in this vein.
2498	19	"""SP"": - On behalf of whom does this McGregor speak? Is there a conditional peace party in the USA or is it a private opinion?"
2498	21	- Today there is no really influential peace party in the USA. Rather, on the contrary, there is a consensus in the political establishment of the country regarding the need to confront Russia. So this is rather a private opinion, but it is clear that there are other experts and individual politicians who have a similar opinion. But in the modern United States, this is almost a marginal position, at least in the public sphere.
2498	23	"""SP"": - The expert criticized Western countries and, in particular, Australia for military assistance to Kyiv and stressed that they should have contributed to a peaceful resolution of the situation, otherwise Ukraine would face destruction and death. Does Australia stand out in any way?"
2498	25	- It's just that he spoke in the Australian media, it is quite logical that he spoke about this country. And so nothing stands out, Australia acts within the framework of the course common to the entire West.
2498	27	"""SP"": - According to McGregor, Ukraine is already in principle a failed state, it can completely disappear from the world map."
2498	29	- The very term “failed state” or “failed state” can be interpreted quite broadly. For example, which state can be considered failed? Which has already completely degraded and cannot perform its functions, or which is just beginning to lose the main features of the state, such as a monopoly on the legal use of violence? If we focus on the second approach, then since 2014, Ukraine can be described as a failed state.
2498	31	If at first, then even now Ukraine is only on the verge of becoming a failed state. But, in my opinion, irreversible changes took place already in 2014, which left very few chances for the existence of a single full-fledged state on the territory of the former Ukrainian SSR.
2498	33	"""SP"": - In the United States, in your opinion, are they already ready to accept the fact that Ukraine will disappear? In what way would they agree to this?"
2498	35	- The fact that Ukraine will disappear from the world map is not a fact, but one of the many scenarios of a possible development of events. Officially, the Americans can agree with this only in the event of some very serious geopolitical cataclysms, much larger than the Ukrainian crisis. And to accept reality, if things turn out in this way, they will be forced.
2498	37	“This is just the opinion of a private person, said in an optional interview,” agrees American political scientist Vladimir Mozhegov.
2498	39	- At the same time, we can say that it reflects the train of thought of many unbiased experts in the West. That's what's interesting.
2498	41	"""SP"": - Is it all about the supply of weapons? If they are stopped, will Ukraine survive? What do they depend on?"
2498	43	- From this phrase, taken out of context, it can be assumed that McGregor wanted to say the following: the supply of weapons leads to the continuation of hostilities. And their continuation will lead to sad consequences for Ukraine.
2498	45	Arms deliveries depend on the plans of the US, Britain and global elites. In these plans, Ukraine does not figure at all as a subject. I think even continental Europe appears weakly.
2498	47	There are interests of the United States and Britain on the one hand and China and Russia on the other. Well, and the interests of global financiers who firmly hold the testicles of the American and British political elites.
2498	49	"""SP"": - In your opinion, the United States can agree with the disappearance of Ukrainian statehood?"
2498	51	- Ukraine here, I repeat, has nothing to do with it at all. Ukraine is needed only to eliminate the military (primarily nuclear) threat to Russia. For the sake of this, Ukraine will be fed without hesitation. And after that, just as without hesitation, they will feed continental Europe. I am afraid that from the point of view of global financial elites, the United States itself may turn out to be an equally insignificant asset, which may just as well be doomed to be eaten up in the fight against China. Global financial elites are only interested in global power. But these elites are mobile and they can exercise their power from anywhere on the planet.
