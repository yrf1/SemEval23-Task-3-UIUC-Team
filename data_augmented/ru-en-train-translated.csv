241	1	Kurginyan: under the guise of democracy, the United States brings bandits to power
241	3	"The United States uses words about democracy in order to put in place leaders who pursue a course of modernization and development in their countries around the world, frenzied bandits, said political scientist, leader of the movement ""The Essence of Time"" Sergei Kurginyan on April 12 in the program ""Civilization"" Russia "" on the air of Radio KP."
241	5	"“Now it is said that our axis of evil is authoritarianism. Since when? What oak tree did they fall from? This authoritarianism was called ""authoritarian modernization"", they prayed for it. They talked about [Haitian President Francois] Duvalier, a wild bandit and dictator, that “this is a son of a bitch, but this is our son of a bitch!”, that this is “authoritarian capitalism,” Kurginyan said about the US attitude towards dictatorships in the period after World War II ."
241	6	"He noted that such leaders did not shy away from outright crimes, being patronized by the United States due to the fact that they were heading for ""authoritarian modernization."""
241	8	“They said the same about everyone else. Chiang Kai-shek, his torture prisons in Peitou and everywhere ... with his son and Ray Klein, who was there [and oversaw their activities], Deputy [CIA Director Allen] Dulles for intelligence. What was that? Democracy? No, it was an authoritarian modernization,” the political scientist explained.
241	10	Kurginyan further emphasized that the attitude of the United States towards leaders who pursued a policy of modernizing their countries changed dramatically in the 2000s, even towards more moderate and obedient to the will of the West.
241	12	“Now everyone, including this unfortunate [Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak, who just licked the feet of the West, they are all accused of being authoritarian leaders and they should be crushed. And in their place they put frenzied bandits. Frantic! Cannibals. And they said: these are democrats!” the political scientist assessed what was happening.
241	14	According to him, all this can have the only possible explanation: the United States is preparing to plunge the whole world into chaos, hoping that it will be able to provide relative order on its territory.
241	16	Recall that in the summer of 2005, speaking at the American University of Cairo, the head of the US State Department, Condoleezza Rice, said that the US had been trying to maintain stability in the Middle East for too long at the expense of democracy.
241	18	"She went on to say that these attempts have not led the US to the desired result, so the US is ready to ""throw away all excuses that hold back the hard work of democracy."""
2410	1	Lukashenka admitted that he is a dictator - but this is good for Belarus
2410	3	"President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko believes that without a dictatorship in the country, Belarusians ""would go naked."" He also criticized Western democracy, dwelling on the alleged advantages of the Belarusian regime. This was reported on April 29 by BelTA."
2410	5	In particular, Lukashenka compared the Belarusian regime with democratic Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, stating that these countries supposedly have no salt, so people are not allowed into Belarus.
2410	7	- That's the whole democracy! Thank God we have a dictatorship. You all criticized me: dictatorship, dictatorship. But there is order under this dictatorship. There would be no dictatorship, so they would go naked, - he added.
2410	9	In addition, the Belarusian president noted that the sanctions that were imposed on Moscow and Minsk because of the war in Ukraine will not break the country, on the contrary, they force them to look for new opportunities.
2410	11	- The market is open, we must move, not cry, - said the dictator.
2410	13	"Lukashenka stressed that it would not be possible to bring Belarus and Russia to their knees due to sanctions, since these ""countries have sufficient resources, technologies and intelligence."""
2410	15	"Earlier, he noted that the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation are trying to build a single Union State on new principles, ""so that no one is offended."" Lukashenka is sure that other republics of the former Soviet Union will also join such an alliance."
24101	1	News of Ukraine
24101	3	Kyiv does not intend to cede its territories for a diplomatic settlement of the conflict, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with CNN.
24101	5	“Ukrainians are not ready to give up their land, to agree that these territories belong to Russia. This is our land. We all talk about it and intend to prove it,” he said.
24101	7	I wonder if you got tired of repeating this mantra? In Kyiv, it is pronounced regularly, and sometimes they talk about the readiness to recognize the borders on 02/24/2022.
24101	9	"So quite recently, the fact that Kyiv could discuss with Moscow the country's borders as of ""until February 24,"" said the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleba."
24101	11	“It would not be very wise for me to disclose our conditions, but today each item can be the subject of dialogue,” he said, stressing that Ukraine will continue to protect the integrity and sovereignty of its territory.
24101	13	"And in early May, Zelensky himself demanded that Russia return to “the borders until February 24.” True, with the proviso that it is also necessary to ""give Crimea back."""
24101	15	From the regularly changing wording, only one conclusion can be drawn: Kyiv is not ready for negotiations at all and is doing everything to prevent them from taking place. In any case, no one asks about his wishes on the terms of potential negotiations.
24101	17	“Zelensky can stop the fighting only if he has a reason to declare victory over Russia,” said Dmitry Galkin, a political observer for the 2000 newspaper.
24101	19	“Otherwise, he risks losing the support of the United States and Great Britain and giving Poroshenko a reason to organize mass protests within the country. Therefore, Zelensky will refuse to resume negotiations, saying that Ukraine will not be able to resume them until Russia promises to give up Crimea and Donbass. But in the event that Zelensky is able to conclude a peace agreement without jeopardizing his political future, then this issue will be removed from the agenda, and its resolution will be declared a matter of the future.
24101	21	"""SP"": - Is there a feeling that Kyiv is doing everything to prevent dialogue at all?"
24101	23	- Kyiv really does not need dialogue now, since it does not have the ability to conclude peace without first demonstrating any significant success on the battlefield. However, Kyiv cannot completely abandon the dialogue, since such a step will produce an unfavorable impression both on European countries and on that part of Ukrainian society that wants a speedy cessation of hostilities. Therefore, Zelensky highlights territorial differences, which at this stage could well be put out of the brackets.
24101	25	"""SP"": - Biden has said more than once that he is not going to force Ukraine to give up territories. But what about in reality? Not going or not able?"
24101	27	- Of course, the UK and Poland would like Ukraine to continue to fight with Russia, and the US administration does not object to the continuation of this military conflict. However, Zelensky in the current situation cannot make peace, not so much because of external pressure, but because of the internal political situation. The military clash with Russia provided Zelensky with the opportunity to destroy Poroshenko as a significant political player and guarantee himself sole dominance in the Ukrainian political space. However, this requires that, under his leadership, Ukraine be able to defeat Russia. In this case, he will have carte blanche to form a post-war political system. As long as there is no such reason, Zelensky needs to continue military operations, as this allows him to block the activities of the opposition media and deprives the opposition of the opportunity to put pressure on the authorities through protest actions.
24101	29	"""SP"": - In the West, many politicians, meanwhile, are ready for the fact that Ukraine may lose territories, and are ready for peace on any terms. But they are still in the minority. What needs to happen for their point of view to prevail?"
24101	31	- As long as the UK and the US are interested in continuing the conflict, the Ukrainian leadership will not listen to the opinion of European politicians who propose to make peace as soon as possible, agreeing to concessions in favor of Russia. I do not think that the position of Washington and London on this issue will change in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the decision of the Ukrainian authorities to agree to make peace on Russian terms can only be determined by internal political factors.
24101	33	“Kyiv’s position on peace negotiations has noticeably toughened, and this happened under the obvious supervision of NATO, the United States and Great Britain,” said Larisa Shesler, chairman of the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine.
24101	35	- It is quite obvious that the conditions set by Kyiv are absolutely unacceptable for Russia, so there are no prospects for their beginning. But this is good, because the preservation of the current power in Ukraine is contrary to Russia's security interests.
24101	37	"""SP"": - Earlier, Kuleba said that Kyiv could discuss the country's borders with Moscow as of ""until February 24."" That is, they agree to the loss of Crimea and part of the Donbass, or how is this to be understood?"
24101	39	- A return to the state of February 24, Kuleba and Zelensky designated as conditions for the start of negotiations. The Ukrainian authorities argued that Russia should return all the territories occupied after February 24, and only after that Ukraine would agree to sit down at the negotiating table on the further fate of the LPR and LPR republics and Crimea.
24101	41	It is quite obvious that any construction that marks the beginning of the negotiation process will be perceived as a betrayal both in Russian and Ukrainian society. The propaganda dispersed in the Ukrainian media about the inevitable victory of Ukraine over Russia makes it absolutely impossible to have a dialogue about peace with Russia, otherwise than on the terms of Russia's surrender.
24101	43	"""SP"": - What kind of dialogue can we talk about if they are not ready to recognize reality? Or is no one going to conduct a dialogue in Kyiv?"
24101	45	- This is not about dialogue, but about an ultimatum presented to Russia by the collective West. Ukraine is a tool, not an active player. It is enough to listen to how seriously the issue of reparations that Russia will be forced to pay to Ukraine is being discussed in order to understand the complete inadequacy of the Ukrainian side.
24101	47	"""SP"": - According to the head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arakhamia, in August Kyiv can conduct ""counter-offensive operations in some places"" and return to dialogue, but from a position of strength. Do they seriously believe this or is it just propaganda aimed at an internal audience?"
24101	49	- The Ukrainian side is committed seriously, in my opinion, counts on obtaining a superweapon that will defeat the Russian army. Since the main receipts of Western weapons are planned for August-September, it is for this period that the Kyiv authorities are preparing counterattacks in the Donbass, in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. This confidence is fueled by the decisions of the NATO countries at Ramstein-3, the promises of lend-lease from the United States and the loud statements of Boris Johnson and Blinken.
24101	51	"""SP"": - Kyiv itself determines this line of behavior, or the West dictates? In the West, many politicians, meanwhile, are ready for the fact that Ukraine may lose territories."
24101	53	- Of course, Ukraine has become a zone where NATO is waging war with Russia by proxy. Some Western politicians are aware of the enormous cost to the economy of sanctions and are willing to reduce support for Ukraine in order to force it to the negotiating table.
24101	55	But most of the Western elite aims at the actual destruction of Russia, and for this they are ready for a temporary deterioration in the state of the economy and the living standards of the population. They rightly remember how the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s turned into the rise of the Western economy, which received at its disposal all the resources of the USSR and its huge domestic market. Likewise at the present time, they expect that the liquidation of Russia will solve the problems of the economic and social crisis of the developed countries of the West, and return energy and other resources of Russia under its full control. The loss of territory, population, or even statehood by Ukraine is an absolutely insignificant problem for them, not worthy of attention.
24101	57	"""SP"": - In your opinion, Ukraine's refusal to recognize reality and enter into negotiations reduce its chances to survive in any form at all? That is, Kyiv's stubbornness plays into our hands?"
24101	59	“I always say that our enemies will not let us down. If Ukraine had at least some sane leadership, if the West had had a more adequate approach to the Russian elite, the Minsk agreements would have been implemented long ago.
24101	61	"But the West needs a complete capitulation from Russia, and a complete transfer of sovereignty and control over all resources into the hands of ""democratic countries"""
24101	63	And since Western leaders constantly declare that the outcome of the conflict will be decided on the battlefield, and not at the negotiating table, we have a chance that “reliable negotiators” will not merge Russia's interests.
24101	65	But, of course, in these conditions, Ukraine's chance to survive is very small.
24103	1	Zelensky latest news
24103	2	By September 1, Ukraine is obliged to pay $1.4 billion of public external debt, according to Bloomberg, one of the two leading US providers of financial information for professional financial market participants.
24103	4	"At the same time, he refers to his own calculations, which are considered very reliable in the world of big finance. At the same time, the external debt of the ""square"" is 56.83 billion dollars. And by the end of 2022, 3.4 billion dollars must be paid."
24103	6	"The agency's sources said that the Ukrainian authorities acknowledge that the ability to pay off loans ""is close to drying up."""
24103	8	According to Bloomberg, several solutions to the problem are being worked out. For example, an issuer may request a bondholder to change the terms of an issued security. Or it will ask for the use of frozen Russian assets as collateral.
24103	10	Also, a draft appeal to President Zelensky has already been submitted to the Rada with a request to start negotiations with foreign partners regarding the cancellation of the state external debt of the country.
24103	12	The network reacted to this news quite actively. At the same time, users do not see a way out for Ukraine from the financial impasse into which the Kyiv regime has driven it:
24103	14	“The West is deliberately driving Ukraine into slavery so that any next ruler will be cornered.”
24103	16	“They confuse Europe with Russia… They’ll write off their debts there, of course.”
24103	18	“Most likely, the West is using Ukraine as a consumable. And the West is profitable. Western countries, including the United States, fought with proxy,” these are typical comments.
24103	20	A well-known Russian economist, expert Alexander Bunich, as a professional, very, very doubts that the Kyiv regime will ever pay off its creditors.
24103	22	“The West, by giving money to Ukraine, is conducting a risky financial operation, it must come to terms with this idea and prepare public opinion for the fact that the loans will not be repaid. The money may never come back. This is, first of all.
24103	24	Secondly, what, in particular, the Americans give to Ukraine, they are trying to formalize it as a lend-lease. Similar to World War II. To now expose Russia indirectly similar to fascist Germany, and Ukraine as an ally country.
24103	26	"Great Britain and the European Union are also trying to condition the return of many types of assistance. That is, almost all assistance to Ukraine will turn into commercial debt for it. Ukraine is now a ""black hole"" for finance - you can pump in one hundred billion, or two hundred, it will absorb everything. And then the Kyiv authorities will say that everything is spent or lost on the battlefield, there is nothing to return."
24103	28	The main debt of Ukraine is huge. After all, it is necessary to take the total external debt, and not just the state (in 2021, the total debt was about $ 90 billion.
24103	30	Now they need to add to them all the credits scored for the special operation - ed.) And she cannot serve him. It is already measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and will gradually increase and increase.
24103	32	And Ukraine still demands that seven billion or even more per month be transferred to support. The one and a half billion to be paid in September is just a current payment. And then they are not going to make it either. I do not even see the prospects of any payments.
24103	34	"""SP"": - What will happen if Ukraine does not pay?"
24103	36	- Most likely, they will be given an installment plan or another loan to pay off loans. The IMF will figure something out. That's just the amount there hung an order of magnitude more than discussed now. And it will be possible to talk about their return only if the Kyiv regime wins the military campaign. Well, if he loses, there will be no one to pay. It is clear that the new government will refuse to take on the debts that the current regime has got into. The issue will somehow be resolved by the September payment, but how Ukraine will continue to pay is a big question.
24103	38	"""SP"": - There is an assumption that the West will send frozen Russian assets to pay off Ukrainian debts."
24103	40	“There are a lot of legal conflicts here. You can talk about this for a long time and at length, but if it comes to putting this idea into practice, a number of problems will arise.
24103	42	The main thing is that Russia, in turn, has debts: both public debt, and total debt, and corporate debt. She can stop payments. Plus, there is the property and assets of non-residents, which Russia is already partially blocking, but can block much more.
24103	44	So, before disposing of the frozen Russian funds, it is necessary to calculate the consequences of this. Now Russia is ready to pay off the public debt, but the West does not want to receive these payments. However, there is still a lot of corporate debt. And, in a good way, if we use the frozen Russian assets, then the repayment of corporate debts will be a priority.
24103	46	The first in line will be real creditors who have suffered from Russia's countermeasures, not Ukraine. Yes, it will most likely not be on this list at all.
24103	48	The expert also explained that the blocked Russian assets are divided into two categories. These are direct state assets, such as gold reserves, and various kinds of private assets of oligarchs and structures associated with them.
24103	50	Of course, much more state property is blocked, but there is too much noise around the funds of the oligarchs: someone could not have lunch, someone was not allowed to take a taxi. And although they were deprived of the opportunity to dispose of only a few tens of millions, everyone is well aware that much larger sums loom there.
24103	52	Therefore, if we are talking about how to pay off the debt of Ukraine, it will be the money of private individuals, and not the state of the Russian Federation, that will be used for these purposes. Using Russian assets means facing claims from creditors and retaliatory sanctions from the Russian side.
24103	54	And there is another moment that cannot be ignored. Although Ukraine owes a fair amount to anyone, its mentor and main sponsor, Uncle Sam, owes much more. At the same time, as Alexander Venediktov, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, diplomatically formulated, “the US public debt is not secured by anything except abstract trust”
24103	56	At the moment, the United States is the most important debtor in the world. Their debt is more than 30 trillion dollars and is constantly increasing.
24104	1	Intimate places of Ukrainians
24104	3	"The pseudo-state of Ukraine is the territory of victorious masturbation called “Ukrainianism”, which has turned from an alternative discipline into a mandatory one. In addition, he lost his natural intimate form, gaining universal ostentatious publicity. Shyness and natural shame have become remnants of modern Svidomo society. A huge country with a multi-million ""live population"" was immersed in the erotic fantasies of total romantic and all-conquering Ukrainians. Nevertheless, such a savage community of sectarians still has its intimate places, which are still protected there. Places that are ashamed in Ukraine are still hidden in every possible way and that they don’t want to talk about. But we are not them, so we'll just talk."
24104	5	Intimate national question
24104	7	Ukrainianness is very similar to schizophrenia. Patients find it possible to simultaneously defend two completely opposite points of view. When Svidomo needs to be shown that they love everyone, that they don’t oppress anyone and aren’t even Nazis at all, they talk about the great national diversity of the Nezalezhnaya, listing Jews, Armenians, Greeks, Tatars and others, forgetting, however, about Russians. But when Svidomo needs to force the rest to adhere to the rules of the Ukrainian sect, they declare that only one citizen lives in Ukraine - some Ukrainians, who, they say, must walk in step, babble on the Move, love dumplings, burn straw didukhs and, of course, to hate the Muscovites in unison. You can object that, they say, in Russia there are also different nationalities, but there is also such a thing as “Russians”, which unites all citizens of the federation. Everything is so, but in Russia no one forces either the Buryats or the Avars to speak only Russian without fail, wear blouses and bast shoes, observe the old Russian holidays, etc.
24104	9	"So, the whole trouble of the Ukrainian national question at the moment is that the citizens of Ukraine are not ruled by Ukrainians by nationality in the literal sense in which it is commonly understood. Instead, the overseas masters send them in batches either Canadians or Georgians. But none of them will be able to compete in numbers and power with the Jewish lobby that occupied the capital city of Kukuev. It is enough to dig into any more or less well-known Ukrainian politician to find out a lot of interesting things. Timoshenko had the surname Kapitelman in her family. Klitschko - Etinson, Poroshenko - Valtsman, Tyagnybok - Frotman, Yatsenyuk - Buckeye. Well, you already know about guys like Rabinovich, Groysman and, of course, Zelensky, who was put in power at the suggestion of Kolomoisky. So now Svidomo are shy. They hide their Jewish masters behind chants that ""Remember, stranger, the owner here is a Ukrainian."" As a rule, if you start a conversation with Svidomo on this topic, he will wince with displeasure and turn the arrows to Russia, sitting on the well-known skate called ""Russians are commanded by Chechens."" That is why in recent years Ukrainian propaganda has been actively trying to present the situation in such a way that the Jews are the main friends of the nationally conscious European Ukrainians and that these fraternal comrades will live like water forever. It must be said, by the way, that the government of today's Israel tangibly supports the Nazis who settled in Kukuev in this regard, but this is a topic for a separate discussion."
24104	11	intimate betrayal
24104	13	"""The whole world is with us""! This message has been actively drummed into euroukram for many years. They want to make Ukraine a showcase for Eastern Europe, to the envy of Muscovites. Then the West sleeps and sees how it will start madly investing trillions and quadrillions in Ukraine. That Ukraine is fighting for world democracy. You can list for a long time. The main thing you need to know is that in, so to speak, deep Svidomo society, this slogan does not work well. I would compare this situation with the monument to Prince Vladimir the Great, standing in Kukuev, he is Vladimir Svyatoslavich, he is also the Prince of Novgorod. The one that is depicted on a banknote with a denomination of one hryvnia. Despite the efforts of the official Ukrainian propaganda to instill the aforementioned prince in the Ukrainian community, the real adherents of the cult of St. Bandera hate Prince Vladimir, wholly and completely justifiably considering him a Muscovite, knowing full well about his Novgorodian roots."
24104	15	"So, while the Ukrainian officialdom from Goebbels-TV explains to the European Ukrainians that they are supported by the whole world, led by America, those very deep European Ukrainians are in a diametrically opposite opinion. This happens because if the euroukr suddenly realizes that he no longer has a single enemy at his side, he will simply lay hands on himself due to the lack of meaning in later life. Ukrainianism is not about creation and love, but about destruction and hatred. That is why modern Ukraine has quarreled with all its neighbors and even in dealing with Poland, despite the ostentatious fraternal embrace, keeps a stone in its bosom. This is because the European Ukrainians have an inflamed sense of their own importance. In other words, they acutely feel that the whole world owes them, while the world itself has an absolutely opposite point of view. Hence the longing in the eyes of everyone who sings the infamous song about the dead puppy. And now, when, it would seem, the whole world should give Ukraine its last shirt, zrada are coming in a tight jamb. Grain is taken away, interest on old loans is forced to be paid, new money is also given at interest, weapons are supplied in small quantities and of poor quality, they don’t break relations with Putin, they don’t want to fight directly with the Russians, they drive refugees, etc. that there are only solid enemies around is much easier than that there are only friends around. But this intimate place hurts no less. And, if you suddenly start listing all those betrayals that ""the whole civilized world"" has committed and is committing against Ukraine, curses will fall on you. It's hard, you know, to suffer from unsatisfied megalomania, and if the Muscovite non-brothers still poke a stick at her, it becomes completely unbearable."
24104	17	intimate homosexuality
24104	19	Do you want to eat Svidomo euroukr? Start a conversation about dignity and glorious ancestors. Let him tell you about what kind of warriors of light they are all there, children of ancient pagan gods, representatives of a superior race, and so on, and then remind you that since Ukraine finally sold out to the United States, there has not been a single year in Ukraine without such a called gay pride parades across the country.
24104	21	LGBT agitation on the streets of Ukrainian cities and open homosexuals at the top of the Kyiv government is the current norm of the independent. Remember such a character - the Cossack Gavrylyuk? A guy who ended up in the Verkhovna Rada for several years only because he happened to stand naked in the cold during the Maidan.
24104	23	"So, back in 2015, this people's choice, who is undoubtedly the very salt of the nationally conscious Ukrainian community, said without a shadow of a joke that the share of gay citizens in the Verkhovna Rada, according to his estimates, reaches half. Fifty percent in a good way, not in a bad way, like how the current soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine speak of their own command. Pan Gavrylyuk was concerned not only with the fact that they were pulling each other, but also with the fact that they were ""pulling each other"", showing a certain solidarity, in moving up the career ladder."
24104	25	"In March 2020, the next issue of the magazine ""Public People"" was published in Ukraine, which was called ""The Most Influential Gays of Ukraine"". There were also Artyom Sytnik, the head of the anti-corruption bureau, and Alexei Goncharuk, who was already a former prime minister at that time, and Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka, and other guys. So Lyashko is not alone."
24104	27	Among Svidomo patriots they know this very well, therefore it is not for nothing that they call all their people's chosen one a word known to all of us, without disassembling. This is a special pain for the entire Ukrainian nation and its special intimate place, which they try to hide in every possible way. And then somehow it turns out uncomfortable. Where is this seen so that you can build a real Reich, operating only with the regulars of the Blue Oyster Bar? But, unfortunately, there is no other way to be friends with the United States. Either you are left alone on an ice floe and suffer from Muscovites, or you have an influential overseas boss, but you pay a certain price for this, actively promoting the blue agenda so hated by the Ukrainians.
24104	29	Intimate Poland
24104	31	The attitude towards the Poles among European Ukrainians is approximately the same as towards the monument to Prince Vladimir - on-duty smiles and knives behind their backs. But the intimacy of these relationships is quite different. The fact is that Ukraine is quietly allowing Poland what it is trying to openly ban to Russia.
24104	33	For example, Svidomo are outraged to the depths of their sensitive souls that Russia is handing out passports to former Ukrainian citizens. After all, this is unacceptable insolence, from their point of view. However, they do not mind at all when Poland is doing the same, distributing the Cards of the Poles. Moreover, in Ukraine this is strongly encouraged. You can say that, they say, this is because Europe is there, and here is unwashed Horde Russia, but they will reasonably object to you that for similar actions Ukraine almost declared war on Hungary, which is also not the last country in the European family. Therefore, what is allowed to Jupiter is not allowed to the bull, because all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others?
24104	35	"Or take, for example, such a funny contraption as MOV. Euroukry are ready to kill for the prefix ""on"", used in relation to Ukraine. These unfortunate guys suffer from a chronic inferiority complex, therefore, in their understanding, when they say “in Ukraine”, they mean part of their own Russian lands, comparing it with “in the Kuban”, but completely forgetting about “in Siberia” or, say, “ in Yakutia."
24104	37	"I happened to hear how one funny Ukrainian expert explained that the prefix ""on"" is used in relation to all sorts of islands - ""to Hawaii"", ""to Madagascar"" and so on. And since Ukraine is the center of the universe, and not some kind of Fatu Khiva, then you need to refer to it, respectively, “in Ukraine” like “in America”. However, Shevchenko himself, in his verses, quite clearly wrote to himself “in Ukraine”. Do you know why? Because he also wrote in Russian, and his works were translated in Poland, where - a big surprise - they say na Ukraine. Such is the joy. Nevertheless, the European Ukrainians forgive this to their Polish brothers, preferring to persecute only Muscovites for the hated “na”. But nevertheless, the above is yet another intimacy of the current Ukrainian sectarianism, which its adherents shyly hide from prying eyes."
24104	39	Intimate Nazis
24104	41	Another completely intimate phenomenon of the modern Ukraine, which has been witnessed, is the promotion of quite a real Nazi, or, as they like to say on our federal channels, neo-Nazi ideology. In Ukraine, this is hidden in every possible way, but the tumor is already so swollen that it is crawling out of all the cracks, and it is positively impossible to keep it. Dudes with swastikas on different parts of their bodies, flags with swastikas in their homes, appropriate stripes on their uniforms - all this constantly flows into the Western press.
24104	43	Either the French TV channel will publish an interview with a “simple Ukrainian family” with a swastika on the wall in the background, or the Reuters agency will show a photo of a car slashed by shrapnel belonging to a “simple Ukrainian”, whose tattooed swastika treacherously peeks out from under the sleeve of a T-shirt. There are a lot of such examples.
24104	45	In the United States, there was a demonstration in support of the inmates blocked at Azovstal, so - it must be this way - the demonstrators were embarrassed to come out with real flags of the Azov regiment with the image of the so-called wolf hook, aka wolfsangel - a symbol actively used by the army of the Nazi Wehrmacht. As a result, Zelensky had to mumble something indistinctly about the fact that in the same Azov regiment there are all sorts of special guys who have specific views, but at the same time they are all undoubted patriots of Ukraine, from whom one should take an example.
24104	47	The intimacy of this moment lies in the fact that in Ukraine they have long wanted to turn around to the fullest, naming the streets after Adolf Hitler and zigua at meetings of the Verkhovna Rada. But for now, they are shy, because it will turn out to be a complete mess for their American masters. It is in Israel, guided by momentary gain, that they forgot what the Holocaust is and what exactly the Bandera people did during the Second World War, but in the same USA there are still influential people and organizations that remember history. It is now that their main sacred cow there is the rights of gays and Afro-Negroes, and until recently these were the rights of Jews, which in no case could be infringed. That lobby, you need to understand, is still strong and is still embarrassed to give the go-ahead to Ukraine in terms of taking off the masks.
24104	49	"From here, in the most independent, the already familiar schizophrenia occurs with a bifurcation of testimony. On the one hand, they have ""Hitler the redeemer"", but on the other - ""Bandera fought against Hitler."" On the one hand, they have completely integrated Nazi armed formations into the official army, and on the other hand, they say that there is no Nazism in Ukraine, because their president is a Jew. In a word, everything here is so confusing, uncomfortable and ugly that the hulks who have witnessed them try not to touch on this painful issue for them and try to reduce discussions on this topic to an answer in the style of “look at yourself”, using arguments at the level of twenty-year-old photographs of some football fans."
24104	51	Intimate self-attacks
24104	53	"And, finally, a completely intimate place associated with such a phenomenon as “self-shelling” or “exploding air conditioners”. In Ukraine, for many years now, with wild cynicism, they have been asserting, including officially through the mouths of state representatives and media attorneys, that ""the separatists are shelling themselves."" Neither the specific calibers of NATO shells, nor the direction of shelling, nor the use of ""Points U"", which are not in service with either the People's Republics or the Russian army, do not confuse dill propaganda and its consumers. But recently, these same “self-attacks” have returned as an unexpected boomerang to the European Ukrainians themselves. The joke about the air conditioner exploding suddenly shone in a whole new light, and the world saw that this game can be played together."
24104	55	"The intimacy of this topic for Svidomo is due to the fact that the bulk of them are well aware that their own trans-Ukrainian fighting brothers are engaged in the killing of civilians and the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of the cities of the LDNR. They know and approve, because, as it should be with sick Ukrainians, they are thirsty for blood and can only hate and destroy. However, having in the depths of their souls the desire to remain white and fluffy, they furiously prove that it is ""you are shelling yourself."" Naturally, this is also caused by the desire to turn the citizens of the People's Republics against their own power."
24104	57	Well, here, as already mentioned, the Special Military Operation began, and from the other side they squealed, demanding to stop the shelling. The best way to respond to a Svidomo Euro-Ukrainian who complains about high-profile arrivals is that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are shelling themselves, plus, again, unexpected explosions of air conditioners are possible.
24104	59	Cynically? Quite. But we are ready to give up this cynicism if they admit everything in Ukraine. If you start to assert in all seriousness, without jokes, resorting to exactly the same arguments that were used in Ukraine to justify the benefits of “separate self-shelling”, then the Svidomo creature will not stand it, bursting into hysteria and curses. This intimate topic for Ukrainians - the topic of the genocide of their own former fellow citizens - is very inconvenient. Of course, they do not want to openly admit this fact in Ukraine, and when you poke their faces into their own lies, they often go into a helpless frenzy.
24104	61	Instead of an epilogue
24104	63	"Time in Ukraine flies with a swift jack, like ""Caliber"" over Zhytomyr. A day goes by three. Events are accelerating, and the wind sown earlier is reaped in a greater and greater storm. It will not be long before some, if not all, of the intimate places of Ukrainians mentioned above cease to be such, just as ethical barriers cease to exist for a corrupt person who sinks lower and lower in his vices and addictions. Each new day will prepare us new wonderful discoveries about our Svidomo non-brothers, on which nature so nicely rested, so well rolled around, like a boar in a muddy puddle."
24105	1	Daily Mail: Bolsonaro doubts Biden's fair election victory
24105	3	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro expressed his doubts about the integrity of Joe Biden's victory in the US elections, reports the British newspaper Daily Mail.
24105	5	"I will not discuss the sovereignty of another country. But Trump was doing really well, Bolsonaro said, commenting on ""stealing a second term"" from former US President Donald Trump."
24105	7	"Earlier, Washington released the list of leaders of states invited to the Summit of the Americas, noting that none of the heads of state of the three countries of the ""Northern Triangle"" (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - ed.) will attend in person. According to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden does not want the presence of ""dictators"" at the summit."
24107	1	"Arno Khidirbegishvili: ""Failed Union"" - refusal to grant Georgia candidate status will be a clear indicator of the failure of the European Union"
24107	3	"In the 90s of the last century, under the term ""Failed States"", its authors - American political scientists Gerald Hellman and Steven Rattner - combined into ""a group of states whose survival is under threat"", ""failed states"" (for example, they mention Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia ) and ""failed states"" (which are called Georgia, Ethiopia, Zaire). That is, countries whose authorities have not acquired ""the ability to govern in the main areas of competence"" (the wording of the German political scientist Ulrich Schnecker) with states whose authorities have lost ""the ability to govern"". The first of these ""competences"" Schnecker calls ""lack of control over the entire territory"" and ""lack of control over external borders."""
24107	5	"Today, 30 years later, as a Georgian political scientist, I want to offer a competent audience a new term - “Failed Union” (FU), and interpret it in relation to the European Union (EU) as “Failed Union”. The first indicator of EU failure was Brexit. It is appropriate to recall that in 2019, the newly elected President of Georgia, Salome Zurabishvili, quite seriously stated that “the UK’s exit from the EU makes room for Georgia.” For this and her other statements at the time - that during her presidency she would return Abkhazia and South Ossetia to Georgia, and Russian investments and tourists would be replaced by European tourists and investments; that Georgia borders on the European Union and 5 million Europeans live in it, for whom “Europe is in their blood”; that the return of Georgia to the European family is the way to success; and unexpectedly sound - that the future of Europe is not yet completely clear, in the case of Georgia - even more uncertainty"" - I called Salome ""Straw Hat""."
24107	7	"The EU is a ""Failed Union"" (FU) also because for all the years of its existence, they have not been able to develop a single foreign policy. The countries of the so-called. ""Old Europe"", the leaders of the EU - Germany and France, under the pressure of ""New Europe"" - Poland and the Baltic countries, as well as the United States, reluctantly transformed into the Anti-Russia project. It began with President Trump joining the anti-Russian sanctions and blocking Nord Stream 2, and ended today with the delivery of weapons to the Kyiv regime. But if, for example, Poland takes risks and adventures, having a completely understandable task - the annexation of Western Ukraine, then the leaders of Old Europe act to the detriment of their national state interests. Therefore, the European Union is a ""Failed Union"" - ""Failed Union"", in which the interests of its member countries are diametrically opposed. The hypothetical victory of Kyiv in the military conflict with Russia will not bring any dividends to France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and others, and colossal problems (deficit and rise in price of hydrocarbons, food, etc.) have already begun."
24107	9	"Disillusioned with the ""Failed Union"", the Eastern Partnership project left half - three out of six - of the actors, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and also the European Union - ""Failed Union"" because the EU leadership does not control the entire territory of the EU. The countries of the ""New Europe"" do not ask permission from Brussels regarding the opening of US and NATO military bases, regarding assistance to Ukraine and the reception of millions of emigrants, most of whom cannot be called ""unfortunate refugees"" and who from there penetrate into the more prosperous countries of Old Europe. Accordingly, on the face - the lack of control over external borders by the EU leadership (see at the beginning - the wording of Ulrich Schnecker)."
24107	11	"Another clear indicator of the failure of the European Union will be the refusal to grant Georgia the status of a candidate member of the EU at the summit of EU leaders on June 23-24 this year. - a new demonstration of inconsistency and double standards. If the status of a candidate is granted to Ukraine, then what is “worse” for Georgia, which has not been at war with anyone for a long time, and accordingly, the need for confrontation with Russia will not arise? It's no secret that for a long time the European Union, as well as NATO, has been accepted by countries for geopolitical reasons (the Anti-Russia project), and not on the basis of the conformity of the economy, government, judicial system, democracy, the media and the civil sector to Western standards. According to this logic, the admission of Georgia is the expansion of the European Union to the East, the only outpost in the South Caucasus, especially since the European Union does not oblige it to any additional obligations and financial costs. On the contrary, the European Union will receive legitimate grounds for shameless interference in the internal affairs and foreign policy of the candidate country for decades to come. Georgia will be obliged to gradually, step by step, comply with the remaining 51% of the conditions for compliance with European standards, and the population will not dare to protest, whether it is the exclusive protection of LGBT rights, the legalization of same-sex marriages, or something similar (as they protest today, when Georgia is only connected to the EU the Association Agreement and the ""visa-free"" ensuing from it)."
24107	13	"But no matter how flexible and streamlined the wording of Georgia's refusal to grant the status of a candidate member of the EU, the current government will not interpret this as a ""big victory"" in the style of Saakashvili's government. (Remember? Georgia was not granted IDA, but Saakashvili's PR fake factory blew all the trumpets that, it turns out, we were given “more than IDA”, or a “golden card”, or even promised to be accepted into NATO without a Membership Action Plan! ). Prime Minister Garibashvili and the ruling party will not “sign up” for open disinformation of the population of Georgia, and this is well known to Brussels. So, as a result, they will quietly rejoice in Russia, where they haven’t even said a word against Georgia’s aspirations for the EU (unlike its aspirations for NATO), despite the steadily expanding economic and uncontested humanitarian channels from Tbilisi."
24107	15	"So what did Georgia “not please” with Europe, which scrupulously fulfilled all the preconditions, which is reflected in the completed two questionnaires? And the speech of Prime Minister Garibashvili during the panel discussion at the Global Security Forum in Bratislava (GLOBSEC, June 2-4 this year) was a lively, non-formal explanation of the motivation for Georgia's aspiration to the European Union - in English, but colorful and emotional in Georgian. Georgia is a unique exception compared to other countries of the ""Associated Trio"" - Ukraine and Moldova, because Georgia, in addition to the non-alternative Euro-Atlantic course, has fixed in the Constitution a non-alternative peaceful solution to the problems of its territorial integrity. Georgia, as Prime Minister Garibashvili said last Friday in Bratislava, fought twice with Russia after gaining independence. But Russia shares the first places with Turkey and Azerbaijan in terms of trade, tourism and remittances to Georgia. And in Russia there is a million-strong Georgian diaspora, so it is impossible to equate Georgia with Ukraine and even Moldova, Georgia among them is the de facto leader in terms of prerequisites for admission to the European Union, to be honest."
24107	17	"Then why will Georgia be denied? Will they really believe the radical opposition - a mix of various parties that use the theme of Saakashvili and the manager of his television company, who are serving sentences for criminal offenses - corruption and embezzlement on an especially large scale?! The radical Georgian opposition, like Poland, can still be understood - if Georgia becomes a candidate for the EU, they need to pack their bags or look for another job, because they will lose the last topic for opposing the authorities, allegedly “pursuing Russian interests in Georgia under a shadow sole proprietorship”. control of the Russian oligarch. But how can the European Union sincerely trust comical political bankrupts from the Georgian opposition?! Thousands of NGOs, emissaries, residents and agents of influence from the West are constantly in Georgia, replacing each other on the principle of rotation, do they not know that the current government firmly holds power like no other in the last 30 years? And the reason is not in the devotion of law enforcement agencies, but in the voter, who, of course, grumbles, but, seeing the support and elementary decency from the authorities, has hope for a better future and the non-return of Saakashvili's executioners. The Orthodox majority - an autochthonous nation - sees the unity of power and the GOC, for which he is grateful to the prime minister and the Georgian Dream party in power. Saakashvili's executioners openly pass us on the street, live as they used to live - in the neighborhood, and even threaten us with revenge - isn't this the highest manifestation of ""European democracy""?! Isn't that just enough to admit Georgia to the European Union?!"
24107	19	"... The summit will start on June 23, and on the second day, June 24, Georgia will not be granted candidate status - most of the EU countries will vote against and wrap it in a beautiful ""candy wrapper"" (as happened in the case of granting the IDA), which will say - “continue to work to meet European standards”, “improve the judicial system”, “continue institutional reforms”, “protect the rights of the opposition and sexual minorities”. And most importantly, on June 24, by not granting the status of a candidate to Georgia and, at the same time, granting Ukraine, the bankrupt Failed Union will demonstrate its own insolvency, because it will not be able to adequately explain the real reasons for its refusal. Unless, of course, the European Union unconditionally recognizes the South Caucasus as a zone of national interests of the Russian Federation, only to declare it openly is “embarrassed”! This is the main reason why Georgia will be denied the prospect of joining the European family, but so that Russia does not “get” it, they will continue to “feed” it with unrealizable hopes. So it was in the case of NATO - for Georgia to fight in Afghanistan, open training centers, conduct NATO exercises and not even think about joining the Eurasian Economic Union. After all, NATO and the European Union are like ""dogs in the manger"" - they do not accept Georgia, and they do not give it to others!"
24108	1	"""The European Parliament has become a victim of fakes"" - Chairman of the ruling party ""Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia"" Irakli Kobakhidze"
24108	3	Georgia, June 10, GEORGINFORM. Yesterday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution initiated by five political groups on violations of media freedom and the safety of journalists in Georgia. The document was supported by 308 MEPs, against - 218. This was preceded by a debate that took place the day before in the European Parliament.
24108	5	Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia ruling party in Georgia, responded to the Resolution yesterday: extremely worrisome,” Kobakhidze said at a briefing.
24108	7	"Georgian Dream names the leaders of the former ruling United National Movement party, which was founded in 2001 by Mikheil Saakashvili, as criminals. According to him, ""it is extremely disturbing when one of the main stages of the modern world, an institution of the European Union of such a high rank, became the victim of a so-called fake."" Kobakhidze named seven or eight European parliamentarians as the creators of fakes, who, according to him, are lobbyists of the United National Movement. He also called it alarming that the media resolution mentions jailed ex-president of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili and director general of the main opposition TV channel Mtavari Arkhi Nika Gvaramia."
24108	9	We cannot easily respond to the part of the European Parliament's resolution that calls on the Georgian authorities to transfer Mikheil Saakashvili abroad and release Nika Gvaramia on humanitarian grounds. It is especially disturbing when we read such calls in a resolution that concerns freedom of the media and human rights,” Kobakhidze said.
24108	11	"God forbid Georgia and any EU country from the standard of media freedom and human rights that Saakashvili and Gvaramia (former deputy chief prosecutor - ed.) introduced in 2004-2012, Kobakhidze said. According to him, there are ""gross factual inaccuracies"" in the resolution."
24108	13	For example, we read in the resolution that the authorities still refuse to transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to a private clinic, while Saakashvili is still in a private clinic today,” the Georgian Dream chairman said.
24108	15	"Another inaccuracy he called the statement that the cameraman of TV Pirveli TV channel Lekso Lashkarava died from injuries received on July 5, 2021, the day when opponents of the LGBT community march cracked down on journalists in the center of Tbilisi. According to Kobakhidze, ""the real cause of his death is well known to society."" The examination called the cause of death of Lashkarav an overdose of drugs, which he acquired five days after the incident in the center of Tbilisi. ""None of the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament from 2012 to this day or in an official document has such a lie slipped,"" Kobakhidze said."
24108	17	"According to Kobakhidze, the resolution of the European Parliament is mainly based on the description of the July 5 events. However, the document does not mention that the investigation began on 12 criminal cases, after which 31 people were detained or arrested. ""On the topic of July 5, we read another false information in the resolution due to the fact that attacks on journalists in Georgia allegedly reached unprecedented proportions after July 5. It is a pity that such facts are not rechecked before the adoption of a resolution by the European Parliament,"" he said."
24108	19	"Kobakhidze called it a paradox that against the backdrop of a call for the release of Saakashvili and Gvaramia, the resolution of the European Parliament declared the founder of the ruling party, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who retired from politics, as an ""enemy of democracy"", and there is a call for sanctions against him."
24108	21	"The leader of the ""Georgian Dream"" stressed that it was after the defeat of the Saakashvili regime by Bidzina Ivanishvili that Georgia's integration into Western structures resumed. ""Even if it is theoretically assumed that Bidzina Ivanishvili is engaged in politics, it is not clear what people who call themselves ""well-wishers"" of Georgia accuse him of. It is a fact, and in fact they know very well that thanks to Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia has only made progress since direction of democracy, human rights and freedom of the media,"" Kobakhidze said."
24108	23	"“Georgia's ""well-wishers"" may not like the fact that Georgia did not join the fateful and fatal war and did not allow the destruction of the country. However, what the patrons of criminals do not like, the Georgian people like is peace, the rule of law and economic development,” Kobakhidze said. ""The resolution, which calls for the release of the enemies of Georgian democracy and media freedom - Saakashvili and Gvaramia, and declares Bidzina Ivanishvili, who has completely distanced himself from politics, the main problem of Georgian democracy and requires sanctions, has nothing to do with European values,"" Kobakhidze said."
24108	25	Such a resolution, according to the owls of the head of the Georgian Dream, is not worth a penny.
24108	27	Kobakhidze expressed hope that by the time Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova become members of the European Union, the European Parliament will be different - protected from the influence of fakes, and protecting real European values.
24108	29	According to him, the opposition's artificial excitement around the issue of granting Georgia the status of a candidate for EU membership doubtfully coincided with a meeting of oppositionists, media and NGO representatives in Bakuriani, where expert Peter Ackerman conducted trainings on coup d'état.
24108	31	"""The opposition's calculation is simple... According to their calculation, Georgia, unlike Ukraine and Moldova, should not receive candidate status, which should be followed by unrest among a part of society, especially young people, and the overthrow of power by the National Movement,"" Kobakhidze said."
24108	33	“The end of all this should be drawing Georgia into the war, which is what the National Movement and its patrons are striving so hard for,” he said.
24108	35	According to Kobakhidze, the European Parliament's resolution can be taken as a kind of hint that Georgia, unlike Ukraine and Moldova, may not be given the status of a candidate for EU membership. “If this happens, naturally, it will be an absolutely illogical and unfair decision, in connection with which every person interested in peace, the rule of law and economic advancement will have his own reaction,” Kobakhidze said. He noted that the authorities will not be ahead of events and will wait until June 23-24, when a final decision on the candidate's status should be made.
24108	37	Georgia applied for EU candidate status on March 3. The country received the questionnaire in an expedited manner and filled it out also in a short time - the first part was handed over to the European Union on May 2, and the second on May 10. The conclusion of the European Commission on the application of Georgia will be ready by June 17. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said that the country had done its homework and was waiting for a political and symbolic decision from the European Union. He also stressed that Georgia is the leading country among the countries of the Eastern Partnership.
24109	1	ARNO KHIDIRBEGISHVILI: GEORGIA SHOULD BREAK DIPLOATIVE RELATIONS WITH UKRAINE!
24109	2	“Why, despite all the difficulties of Russian-Georgian relations, did Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili once again confirm that official Tbilisi will remain neutral regarding the situation in Ukraine?” - Aleksey Davydov, permanent host of the Opinion program on the News Front TV channel, asked Arno Khidirbegishvili, Editor-in-Chief of the information and analytical agency Gruzinform.
24109	4	Arno Khidirbegishvili: “Garibashvili’s development as a manager took place in the business structure of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, therefore, after becoming prime minister, he thinks like a businessman, in pragmatic categories, at the same time being a patriot of his country and a responsible politician. And the main principle of Bidzina Ivanishvili, after entering politics, was voiced by himself on November 1, 2012, at his first press conference, and it sounds like this: “Everything that is in the interests of Georgia.” This is how Ivanishvili answered a journalist's question - can Georgia join the Eurasian Union in the future? Ivanishvili, having become prime minister in 2013, did not restore trade, economic and humanitarian relations with Russia in order to interrupt them now!
24109	6	And how can you impose sanctions on yourself?! The Russian market is traditional for Georgian exports, Russia is the main trading partner of Georgia, millions of Russian tourists and visitors - Russia also leads in this article, one of the main ones in the state budget, replenishing the Georgian state treasury, transport links with Russia, including the transit of goods and goods through Georgia, money transfers from Russia to Georgia worth half a billion dollars a year - all this is from Russia, we even eat Russian daily bread, because Russia is the only grain supplier to Georgia! So who will suffer from the sanctions - Georgia or Russia?! Sanctions are natural masochism!
24109	8	"The year before last, the radical opposition of Saakashvili-Burdzhanadze had already succeeded in a provocation with the Gavrilov delegation, because of which Georgia lost direct air links with Russia, the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the abolition of the visa regime with Georgia was about to be issued, and this also failed due to verbal and physical insult to the delegation of the State Duma in Tbilisi! Georgia then miraculously avoided a war with Russia, which President Zurabishvili tried to provoke, who, instead of condemning Saakashvili's provocateurs, on the morning after the so-called. ""Nights of Gavrilov"" called Russia ""Georgia's enemy No. 1"". As a result, the state budget of Georgia suffered billions in losses. This is how they carried out the largest economic sabotage against Georgia, but Zurabishvili has not been impeached to this day, they have not been arrested, as Sarkozy, Berlusconi and many European leaders were earlier, and today she, instead of testifying to the investigator and telling what kind of intelligence she works for and by whom recruited, again make subversive provocative statements against Georgia, its government, in the rank of the country's president!"
24109	10	Now all this has begun to recover, tourists and visitors have reached out to Georgia, and direct air communication with Russia will soon be restored, so an order has been received - urgently to boycott all this! On April 4, 2022, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inflicted another insult on Georgia at the state level, accusing it of smuggling and calling its government smugglers! In its official statement, Ukrainian intelligence accuses Georgia of “supplying a large range of military, dual-use and civilian goods” to Russia in circumvention of international sanctions. “In order to circumvent sanctions, Russian agents are establishing smuggling channels, which pass, in particular, through the territory of Georgia. At the same time, representatives of the Georgian special services were instructed by the political leadership not to interfere with the activities of smugglers, ”the official statement of the Ukrainian military intelligence says, at the end of which it is “in passing” that another impending “crime” is reported - the restoration of direct air traffic between Russia and Georgia, allegedly as a reward for smuggling!
24109	12	This is a sufficient reason for any self-respecting state A - to send a protest note to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, B - to recall its ambassador from Ukraine, C - to announce sanctions against Ukraine, D - to break off diplomatic relations with Ukraine. Ukraine, which since 2013 has been an unfriendly state to Georgia!
24109	14	Did Ukraine announce sanctions against Russia during the August 2008 war? No, and the West has not announced! And why should Georgia do it today because of Ukraine?! Georgia, after the August events, broke off diplomatic relations with Russia and has not restored to this day, and Ukraine today, in the midst of a large-scale war, does not interrupt diplomatic relations with Russia! Georgia to this day adheres to the course of joining NATO, and Ukraine has already announced that it is ready to become a non-bloc neutral country. Yes, NATO is a bluff and a provocation, but the point is in principle: so who betrayed them, these principles? Georgia or Ukraine? So maybe in Kyiv, before blaming Georgia, they will turn on themselves?!
24109	16	"How did Ukraine help Georgia in August 2008? Yes, she sold weapons to Georgia, sent instructors and mercenaries, not for free either! Ex-president Saakashvili was put on the wanted list by the Prosecutor General's Office of Georgia, which sent requests to Kyiv for his extradition to Georgia, and he was granted Ukrainian citizenship and appointed to high government positions - presidential adviser, governor of Odessa! And then the Ukrainian intelligence carried out a special operation - they smuggled, in a container with dairy products, a citizen of Ukraine, Saakashvili, into Georgia to organize a coup d'état - to overthrow the current legitimate government of Georgia in the style of ""Euromaidan""! Georgia filed another case against Saakashvili for illegally crossing the Georgian border, but before the Georgian border, Saakashvili illegally crossed the Ukrainian border as well! If this was not a special operation of Ukrainian intelligence, why has not a criminal case been opened in Kyiv against Saakashvili for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border? Moreover, Kyiv demands urgent return of Saakashvili to Ukraine! So who are the smugglers after that - the Georgian special services and politicians, as stated in the statement of Ukrainian intelligence, or the Ukrainian intelligence itself and Ukrainian politicians who smuggled Saakashvili into Georgia?!"
24109	18	"Last year, Georgia went to meet the Kyiv authorities and became a member of two anti-Russian associations - the ""Associated Trio"" together with Ukraine and Moldova, and the ""Crimean Platform"". Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili personally flew to Kyiv for their presentation and the whole world paid attention to his speech, which was distinguished by criticism of Russia - incomparably sharper than the speech of President Zelensky himself! But on the second day, the Georgian prime minister was given an unheard-of insult - he was invited to a military parade on the occasion of Independence Day, where there was a deputy to President Zelensky for reforms - convicted by a Georgian court and wanted by the Georgian prosecutor's office accused of many grave crimes against Georgia and humanity - Misha Saakashvili, who daily insulted the Georgian authorities with Putin's slaves! Of course, Garibashvili immediately turned around and went to the airport, and Saakashvili was in the center of attention at the parade, ran from podium to podium, and then took pictures in an embrace with Bartholomew and sang praises to him!"
24109	20	"Georgia has always supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and on February 24, after the start of the war, Georgia signed all anti-Russian petitions in all international organizations - the OSCE, PACE, the EU, the UN. Georgia, since the time of the first and second ATO, has sent and is sending hundreds of tons of aid to Ukraine, doctors, medicines, food, wounded Ukrainian soldiers were treated and rehabilitated in military hospitals and rehabilitation centers of the Georgian Ministry of Defense, and all this is free, fraternally! And official Kyiv and President Zelensky “convicted” Georgia of “smuggling” and called it “immoral, which does not keep its word”, recalled the Ukrainian ambassador from Georgia - because Georgia did not join the economic blockade of Russia and did not send weapons to Ukraine and Georgian regular army! Every day, delegations of criminals - former Saakashvili officials, mostly top-level security officials and parliamentarians - visit Kyiv, meet with his Zelensky administration, speak in the Rada, on Ukrainian television, where they call on the world to punish Georgia! So where are the ""immoral traitors"" after that - in Kyiv, or in Tbilisi?!"
24109	22	Georgian refugees from Abkhazia and Tskhinvali still live in slums - in abandoned emergency buildings of schools and hospitals, in unsanitary conditions, without water and sewerage, electricity and gas, in plywood huts in Tserovani, because Saakashvili stole hundreds of millions of euros of EU aid, on which decent houses for refugees were to be built! And Ukrainians today live in luxurious private hotels in Tbilisi and Batumi, for which the Georgian state pays - that is, the Georgian taxpayer, the Georgian people, who themselves are in dire need and unable to buy food and medicine! But Ukrainian refugees are fed free of charge, they issued vouchers for free medicines at any pharmacy! In Georgia, Russian schools and faculties of universities, even the only kindergarten in Tbilisi, were closed long ago, and Ukrainian departments in universities were instantly opened for Ukrainians, places were allocated in school classes and kindergartens!
24109	24	Ukraine invited almost all ex-high-ranking criminals from Saakashvili's team to Kyiv, equipped and employed them, providing them with the highest positions in the Ukrainian government! Filaret treated and blessed the Georgian criminals and former military men, awarding them orders for participating in a large-scale punitive operation against the civilian population of Donbass! Tell me, what would be the reaction of Kyiv if Yanukovych or Azarov were sheltered and warmed in Tbilisi, who, by the way, unlike Saakashvili and his henchmen, did not torture or kill their fellow citizens?!
24109	26	"“Open a second front against Russia in Georgia, attack the Russian military base in Abkhazia!” - Yes, how can a friend force such a provocation, especially when Georgia has already lost 20 percent of its territory?! South Ossetia, Abkhazia, again - South Ossetia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and also - the so-called. ""Tbilisi war"" - what, besides coffins, did Georgia get from all these wars?! And the million-strong Georgian diaspora in Russia will immediately become a hostage if Tbilisi announces anti-Russian sanctions and pursues an irresponsible policy, did anyone think about this?! And what kind of military power can Georgia oppose to Russia?!"
24109	28	"However, Ukraine does not deserve gratitude even from Saakashvili's supporters - remember how the Kyiv authorities treated the ex-president of Georgia and the militants of the ""Georgian Legion"" who shed blood for her in the Donbass - Saakashvili was dragged by the hair and thrown out of Ukraine, depriving him of citizenship, and "" The Georgian Legion was disbanded and expelled without even being granted citizenship! Some of them today shoot Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Chechens for money, but when neo-fascists are liquidated in Ukraine, won't they be asked - dear Georgians, why did you shoot at us? Two Slavic peoples sorted things out, and where did you guys go?! What will we say to Ukrainians, Belarusians, our neighbors, Russian Chechens?! Any citizen of Georgia, according to the Law on Citizenship (Article 21, paragraph 1 subparagraph ""a""), automatically loses Georgian citizenship if, without the permission of the competent authorities of Georgia, he fights in the armed forces, or serves in the special services of another country. Therefore, all fascist Georgians who are fighting today in Ukraine should be arrested when they try to enter Georgia. I really hope that Prime Minister Garibashvili will order the Georgian border guards to fulfill the Law!"
2411	3	He does not rule out the possibility that the Russian dictator may not survive after this war.
2411	5	Kirill Budanov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, spoke about two possible options for ending the war in Ukraine: either Russia will break up into two or more parts, or power will change there. During an interview with NV, he spoke about his confidence that Ukraine would win.
2411	7	This war will end. There are only two options for how it can end... The first is the division of Russia into three or more parts. And the second is the relative preservation of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation in the event of a change in the country's leadership. In the latter case, the new leader will say that the Russian Federation has nothing to do with all these processes, it was a sick dictator, and the country has nothing to do with it. In this case, Russia will give up all the territories it occupies - from the islands of Japan to Koenigsberg, the current Kaliningrad, which belongs to Germany, - Budanov believes.
2411	9	"The head of intelligence, answering the question of whether Putin will remain alive after our victory, noted that the dictator ""has driven himself into a dead end."""
2411	11	Leaving him an escape route is one strategy, but it's almost impossible. He is a war criminal for the whole world. This is his end, he drove himself into a dead end, - said Budanov.
2411	13	Regarding the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, he noted that there is always such a risk, but this will only hasten the end of the Russian Federation.
2411	15	Recall that the Russian war against Ukraine, according to many experts, was supposed to last less than a week. But now it's been going on for three months now. Now is a good time for the US and its allies to take stock of all that has been achieved and to make a plan for what to do next. The Washington Post writes that the States will have to support our state for a long time, but the victory over Vladimir Putin is worth it.
24110	1	ARNO KHIDIRBEGISHVILI: WHEN THE DESCENDANTS OF GEORGIANS ARE INTERESTED IN HOW GEORGIA WERE SOLD, LET THEY READ THESE LINES…
24110	3	"When, after the liquidation of the USSR and the war in Abkhazia, I explained hundreds of times, in newspapers and on television, why, if Georgia declared military and political neutrality, it could exchange its neutral foreign policy course with Russia - for Abkhazia, Georgian ""political scientists"" nicknamed me ""Comrade Neutrality"" and avoided coming to TV debates with my participation, for which I called them ""procto-political scientists"" - that is, interpreting events exclusively in hindsight, post factum, to please the current government (see on GEORGINFORM, under the heading ""FROM THE EDITOR ”, on the GRUZINFORM channel in You Tube, etc.). Today, these former party school lecturers can only be met in queues for real proctologists, but in the time of Shevardnadze and even in the first years of Saakashvili's presidency, they did not get off the TV screens and walked importantly along the corridors of the government administration, fulfilling a generously paid political order."
24110	5	• GEORGIA THEN DID NOT BECOME NEUTRAL AND LOST THIS trump card TO RUSSIA, BUT SOON EVERYTHING WILL BECOME A NEUTRAL COUNTRY, LIKE UKRAINE, BUT ALREADY - UNDER COMPULSORY, WIN NOTHING FROM THIS.
24110	7	When President Saakashvili decided to vote for Georgia in favor of Russia's membership in the WTO, I warned that Abkhazians and Ossetians would not allow any monitoring of goods - even Georgian, even Swiss - passing through Abkhazia and South Ossetia, all the more so - Georgian border guards would not be allowed to enter Psou and to the Roki tunnel for a cannon shot and we will lose this trump card just like that. Saakashvili and his team then pretended to be stupid, because a lot of money was sold for it!
24110	9	• GEORGIA LOST THIS trump card TO RUSSIA SIMPLY SO, ALTHOUGH IT COULD USE IT TO RESTORE ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. GEORGIA VOTED FOR RUSSIA'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE WTO WITHOUT RECEIVING ANYTHING IN RETURN, AND A PRIORI THE FICTIONAL AGREEMENT ON MONITORING OF CARGO AND GOODS HAS BEEN RESERVED AS WASTE PAPER.
24110	11	When I stated that Georgia might not have time to exchange with Russia the refusal of Georgia's aspirations to NATO for the return of Abkhazia and Ossetia to it, they did not hear me point-blank and looked like I was crazy.
24110	13	• GEORGIA DID NOT MAKE TIME - ON FEBRUARY 24, RUSSIA STARTED A MILITARY OPERATION IN UKRAINE, WHICH WAS NOT ACCESSED TO NATO, LIKE GEORGIA. GEORGIA, FOLLOWING UKRAINE, WILL SIGN NON-BLOCK STATUS. BUT IT WILL BE FORCED TO DO IT, AND NOT BY INITIATIVE, THEREFORE, ABKHAZIA AND SOUTH OSSETIA WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO US FOR THIS.
24110	15	"When I said that Georgia should think about how not to lose Adzharia, because the period for which the Treaty of Kars was concluded, according to which Russia was the guarantor for Georgia, has expired, and today Russia will not defend a country with which it has no diplomatic relations and which is in the camp of its enemies, with the United States and NATO, I was accused of Turkophobia, and the Turkish ambassador “sincerely laughed” - they say, the agreement is not milk, so that it expires (?!). I stated: “The only thing that can protect Georgia from Turkish expansion in the face of enmity with Russia is its entry into the CSTO, respectively, into the EAEU, which will lead to the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia according to the formula “Georgia + Russia = Georgia + Abkhazia + South Ossetia"". And I also said that “the mission of President Salome Zurabishvili is to transfer Ajaria to Turkey, just as the mission of President Mikheil Saakashvili was to transfer South Ossetia to Russia (“reunification of the divided Ossetian people following the example of Germany”) and Abkhazia.” For this I was branded ""pro-Russian""."
24110	17	• LAST WEEK, RUSSIAN SENATOR ANDREY KLIMOV STATED THAT ADJARIA WILL BECOME AN INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC, AS ABKHAZIA AND SOUTH OSSETIA WERE, AND WILL BE UNDER TURKEY IF GEORGIA PARTICIPATES IN ANTI-RUSSIAN SANCTIONS, THAN ZFIIDVENTI VENTI VAN TELEVIS.
24110	19	I repeat for the hundredth time - declare Adjara its independence, even without joining Turkey, the Samtskhe Javakheti region, gravitating towards Armenia, and the Kvemo Kartli region, gravitating towards Azerbaijan, as well as the Samegrelo region, inextricably linked with Abkhazia, will immediately do the same.
24110	21	Someday, if the descendants of Georgians are interested in how they sold their homeland - Georgia, let them read these lines too ...
24111	1	Ukraine: non-Kyiv non-Rus
24111	3	"The head of the Center for Ukrainian Studies at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Viktor Mironenko, called Russia ""a younger brother"", contrasting the Russian world with ""big Ukraine"". Colleagues from the Russian Academy of Sciences categorically disagreed with him. Historians explained why Ukraine cannot be called the successor of Ancient Rus', and also where it was born"
24111	5	"The head of the Center for Ukrainian Studies at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Viktor Mironenko, called Russia ""a younger brother"", contrasting the Russian world with ""big Ukraine"". Colleagues from the Russian Academy of Sciences categorically disagreed with him. Historians explained why Ukraine cannot be called the successor of Ancient Rus', and also where such false theories come from."
24111	7	The head of the Center for Ukrainian Studies at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences, adviser at the Mikhail Gorbachev Foundation, Viktor Mironenko, caused a resonance in Russia with his statement that Ukraine “bears a great responsibility for Russia, like Great Britain, for example, for the United States of America”, since “the main intellectual influx to Russia has long been carried out through Ukraine.
24111	9	A Russian scientist, a native of Chernigov, said on the air of the 112 Ukraine TV channel that Russia is allegedly secondary in relation to Ukraine. “The younger brother, of course, is Russia, without any doubt,” he said, emphasizing that he “speaks like a historian.”
24111	11	"According to Mironenko, Kyiv, Chernigov, Pereslavl, and the Middle Dnieper were the ""core"". And this ""core"", according to him, gradually expanded, ""people left"". Only “big Ukraine” can be opposed to the Russian world, and it is such, says the head of the Center for Ukrainian Studies at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences."
24111	14	Mironenko's words were commented on by fellow historians from the Russian Academy of Sciences. Some took his statement as flagrant illiteracy, others suggested that Mironenko's words be regarded as an unsuccessful joke, since it has become fashionable in Ukraine for some time now to assign Ukrainian nationality to Russian and Soviet historical figures. Suffice it to recall the Russian artist of Armenian origin Ivan Aivazovsky, the daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Princess Anna, the baptizer of Rus', Prince Vladimir, and the epic hero Ilya Muromets, to whom a monument was unveiled in Kyiv. Ukraine is engaged in rewriting history based on nationalism, but historians demand to separate facts from politics.
24111	16	"Doctor of Historical Sciences, professor, leading researcher of the St. Petersburg Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences Boris Kovalev, in a conversation with a correspondent of the VZGLYAD newspaper, noted that the concept of ""ancient Russian state"", which is the key subject of the dispute, appears early, but becomes popular at the end of the XIX century."
24111	18	“This is due to the fact that the concept of “Kievan Rus” was promoted by our common, I emphasize this, common historians of the Russian Empire and was actively supported by Academician Boris Rybakov, the author of university textbooks on the history of the USSR from ancient times to the 18th century. We lived in a single state, and what difference does it make what is more valuable to us: the mother of Russian cities, Kyiv, sovereign Petersburg, or merchant Moscow? Kovalev emphasized.
24111	20	The historian recalled that due to their prosperity, the southern Russian cities more difficultly endured the Tatar-Mongol invasion. According to the expert, Kyiv was wiped off the face of the earth in the 13th century and it was wrong to call it a city at that time, it was a settlement. “Then it was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the Commonwealth, and only at the end of the 17th century Ukraine became part of the Russian state. It seems to me that this person’s statement should be taken less seriously, as some kind of not entirely successful joke, ”Kovalev noted. The historian recalled that the secretaries of the Central Committee of the CPSU Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev were from Ukraine, like many other Soviet politicians. In this sense, Ukraine was a good start for the party career of many people who decided the fate of the Soviet Union.
24111	22	Kovalev expressed the opinion that the leadership of the Russian Academy of Sciences would turn a blind eye to supporting Mironenko's Ukrainian myths, since the level of freedom and opposition is very high.
24111	24	The publicist Yegor Kholmogorov approached the position of Viktor Mironenko more emotionally, calling his statement another “delusional generation” of Ukrainian nationalists.
24111	26	“There is no reason to consider Russia as a junior compared to Ukraine. Let's start with the fact that Ukraine cannot be fully considered as a continuation of Ancient Rus' with its capital in Kyiv.
24111	28	"The fact that Ukraine partially occupies the same territory does not make it a successor, given, say, the prevalence of Catholicism in Ukraine, Uniatism (a religious trend in Ukraine that unites both Orthodoxy and Catholicism - approx. VIEW), the notorious ""Western choice "". All this does not correspond to the principles of Orthodox civilization on which Ancient Rus' was built, ”Kholmogorov noted to the VZGLYAD newspaper."
24111	30	The publicist commented on Mironenko's words that Gorbachev's wife was from Ukraine and, like many other Soviet politicians, had an important influence on Russia: “Given how many Russians feel about Gorbachev, he gave a very dubious example. This speaks, rather, of the harm that such shots could cause. Of course, educated people came from Ukraine at a certain period, because through Polish channels they received a European education, the Kiev-Mohyla Academy was founded, where many bishops, monks and scientists of the Western European type studied in the 18th century. But this does not speak of the outstanding contribution of Ukraine, but of the fact that in the era of Peter's reforms there was a demand for this type of intellectuals. But as soon as Russian scientists from different parts of the country began to travel to study in Germany, the demand for scientists from Kyiv immediately disappeared,” Kholmogorov noted.
24111	32	The publicist emphasized that most of Ancient Rus' was located on the territory of modern Russia: such key centers of Rus' as Staraya Ladoga, the Novgorod Republic, were of paramount importance for the creation of the Russian state.
24111	34	“Prince Oleg conquered Kyiv, killed the great princes and established a new capital there. Smolensk, Rostov the Great - all these are the centers of Ancient Rus', which are much older than Kyiv in terms of their political significance at that time. In this sense, Ukraine simply does not have any advantages, on the grounds that it currently has Kyiv, in terms of seniority over Russia, and these are ridiculous fantasies, ”Kholmogorov emphasized, noting that the only encouraging thing is that after the period when Ukrainians said that they are “non-brothers”, today Ukrainian speakers again turn to the term brotherhood, albeit imposing themselves into “older” brothers.
24111	36	Kholmogorov insists that Ukraine cannot be held responsible for Russia:
24111	38	“It is enough to compare the dynamics of the economy and demographics of Ukraine and Russia in recent years. The situation is so sad that I think there can be no talk of any care for them for us. Ukraine, unfortunately, today has fallen to the “African” level of development of life,” the publicist believes.
24111	40	The head of the Center for the History of Ancient Rus' of the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladimir Kuchkin, in a conversation with the correspondent of the VZGLYAD newspaper, said that Mironenko did not know history well, calling his words outright stupidity:
24111	42	“He is doing as his predecessors did, who believed that it was necessary to raise the downtrodden Ukrainian people to cultural heights, and now they are announcing things that are in no way consistent with history. And he clearly wants to prove that the Ukrainians allegedly existed since ancient times, although everyone was called Rus, he wants to prove that the Ukrainians also influenced the growth and power of the Russian princes, just as Great Britain influenced the States in the 18th century. The parallel is bad,” said historian Vladimir Kuchkin.
24111	44	According to Kuchkin, this is like saying that Northern Ireland bears a great responsibility for the US positions.
24111	46	“This is sheer stupidity. We must proceed from certain historical circumstances, phases of historical development, because otherwise we will not understand the course of history,” Kuchkin believes.
24111	48	The expert recalled that there were no Ukrainians in the 9th century, when a large ancient Russian state was formed, and all peoples (Polyans, Drevlyans, Krivichi, etc.) were called Rus, and such statements resemble nationalism, which is very popular today in Ukraine:
24111	50	“Ukrainian nationalism, which is developing now, was back in the 90s of the XIX century in Little Russia, when capitalism began to develop there. The nationalists saw that the Ukrainian people lived in poverty compared to their neighbors, and they wanted the Ukrainians to be equal in rights with the Austrian Germans, the Great Russians. They raised the issue of the consolidation of Ukrainians, and it began to grow after two world wars, and even earlier appeared in Western Europe,” said the head of the Center for the History of Ancient Rus' of the Institute of Russian History.
24113	3	UK hospital data shocks the world: 80% of COVID deaths are vaccinated… COVID deaths up 3,000% after vaccination wave
24113	5	A deadly combination of scientific fraud, institutional coercion, bribery, censorship of big technology, government power and media propaganda is bringing the world to its knees. There is NO real data to show that covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. Right now, hospital data from the United Kingdom is shocking the world, providing strong evidence of vaccine failure and vaccine-related deaths. In the UK, up to 80 per cent of COVID deaths now come from vaccinated people.
24113	7	Deaths from COVID in the UK are now 3,000 per cent more common than at the same time a year ago when the population was 'unvaccinated'.
24113	9	For more than a year, the vaccine's effectiveness has steadily advanced, although the absolute risk reduction for all COVID vaccines on the market was less than two percent, which is a meaningless number. To make matters worse, vaccines increase iatrogenic mortality rates and make more people susceptible to severe respiratory illness by inoculating human cells to increase dependence on antibodies.
24113	11	UK Public Health Death Data Shocks World
24113	13	The UK Yellow Card Scheme, a surveillance system for vaccine-related injuries and medical errors, shows a clear picture of vaccine failure. COVID vaccines increase hospitalizations and deaths for people who could easily continue their lives being healthy and VAX-free. Instead of being forced into risky experiments with a combination vaccine, thousands of sick and dying people could be exposed to potential infection and recover with strong natural immunity.
24113	15	"UK hospital data shows the number of deaths from COVID-19 is now 3,000 percent higher than last year, and it's not the ""unvaccinated"" people who are dying in greater numbers. The latest figures from Health England show just how dangerous vaccine worship and coercion can be. From February 1, 2021 to September 12, 2021, the unvaccinated accounted for just 28 percent of COVID deaths, while the vaccinated accounted for 72 percent of deaths!"
24113	17	Public Health Scotland confirms the same pattern of vaccine failures. From 14 August 2020 to 12 September 2020, there were only seven COVID-19-related deaths in Scotland. After forcing a significant portion of the population to get covid vaccinated, Scotland recorded 222 COVID-19 deaths in just one year, in the same time frame. This surge in deaths from COVID-19 is 3071.4% higher after the mass vaccination campaign. Most shockingly, 80 percent of these deaths occur among the vaccinated.
24113	19	The vaccine's supposed efficacy of 95% is a complete scam in the real world, in fact it increases the risk of death.
24113	21	"Even though the unvaccinated are being forced to be tested more often for travel, school and work, their numbers are still comparable to those who are “fully vaccinated”. The data shows that COVID cases are relatively equal between vaccinated and unvaccinated. From August 21 to September 17, 2021, there were 69,639 positive cases in the unvaccinated population and 79,613 cases in the vaccinated population, with 60,923 of these cases coming from ""fully vaccinated"". Clearly, the vaccine does not prevent COVID and may even be a driver of new infections among the unvaccinated."
24113	23	The most shocking thing is that the mortality rate in the vaccinated group is not less than 95 percent. From 14 August to 10 September 2021, there were 208 deaths from COVID-19 in Scotland. There were 41 deaths among the unvaccinated, 9 deaths among the partially vaccinated, and a shocking 158 deaths among the fully vaccinated. If the vaccine were 95 percent effective, then 95 percent of deaths would be in the unvaccinated and only 5 percent in the vaccinated. However, up to 80 percent of deaths occur in the vaccinated and only 20 percent of deaths occur in the unvaccinated.
24114	3	A joint statement ending the COVID-19 emergency, restoring scientific integrity, and trying those responsible for crimes against humanity was issued by 17,000 doctors and medical scientists on May 11 on the Global COVID Summit website.
24114	5	"The statement explicitly states that ""the disastrous public health policy regarding COVID-19 imposed on doctors and our patients is the culmination of a corrupt medical alliance of pharmaceutical, insurance and healthcare institutions, and the financial trusts that control them."""
24114	7	"According to the signatories of the statement, this corrupt alliance has infiltrated the Western medical system at all levels. Not only that, this conglomerate is protected and supported by a parallel alliance of digital giants, media, academics, and government agencies ""who profited from this orchestrated disaster."""
24114	9	“This corrupt alliance has compromised the integrity of our most prestigious medical societies, to which we belong, by creating the illusion of scientific consensus, substituting propaganda for the truth. This alliance continues to promote unscientific claims, censoring data, and intimidating and firing doctors and scientists for simply publishing actual clinical results or treating their patients with proven, life-saving drugs,” the dissident doctors and scientists wrote.
24114	11	"The signatories of the statement explicitly called the decisions on the methods of combating COVID-19 ""catastrophic"" and said that they paid for it with the health and lives of patients, ""as a result of the deliberate denial of critical and urgent treatment or as a result of forced injections of gene therapy, which are neither safe or effective."""
24114	13	"Scientists and doctors said that as a result of Western policy, patients were denied the right to informed consent to experimental injections for COVID-19. Patients were also deprived of any information about available treatments ""due to widespread censorship and propaganda spread by governments, public health officials and the media."""
24114	15	"The statement also noted that this deprivation of the right of patients to information about treatment, and doctors of the right to treat with effective drugs is not accidental. They recalled that in a book called ""COVID-19: The Great Reset,"" the leadership of this corrupt alliance clearly stated ""that their intention is to use COVID-19 as an 'opportunity' to reset our entire global society, culture, political structures and economics."
24114	17	“The mission of the Global COVID Summit is to end this orchestrated crisis that has been illegally imposed on the world and to put on record that the actions of this corrupt alliance constitute nothing less than crimes against humanity,” the letter signers said.
24114	19	"Based on hundreds of clinical trials, letter signatories call for an end to ""experimental COVID-19 genetic therapy injections"", an end to obstructing doctors from providing life-saving medical care to COVID-19 patients, an end to the COVID-related state of emergency where it remains, reinstatement and more never violate medical confidentiality, and stop violating people's basic rights, including the right to use public transport, including air travel."
24114	21	"The medics also said ""that masks are not and never have been effective protection against airborne respiratory virus in public places."" They called for ""research on the harm, death and suffering of vaccination"" and an end to discrimination based on vaccination status."
24114	23	“We declare that Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, Janssen, Astra Zeneca and their activists withheld and deliberately omitted safety and efficacy information from patients and physicians and should be held accountable for fraud immediately,” the letter said.
24114	25	This declaration was the fourth in two years from the Global COVID Summit. Among the signatories of the declaration are Dr. Robert Malone, one of the creators of mRNA technology, Dr. Pierre Corey, Dr. Paul Marik (all from the USA), Dr. Tess Laurie (Great Britain) and many other doctors and scientists from Western countries who previously expressed opposition to the official point of view on ways to combat COVID-19 and treatments.
24115	2	How true is the official version about the safety of vaccines against COVID-19? Governments and media mislead people
24115	4	However, in the following months, information emerged about the side effects of vaccines. This suggests that the official version, fanatically promoted by governments and health officials, misleads people at best, leads them to death at worst. The medical community itself is hopelessly divided over the usefulness of vaccines.
24115	6	"Moreover, governments around the world have ruthlessly forced vaccines on people. US President Joe Biden even unceremoniously called it a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated."" This statement is clearly false and is supported by both science and statistics."
24115	8	Vaccination policy questionable
24115	10	"Writing in the prestigious medical journal TheLancet, University of Colorado Associate Professor of Infectious Diseases Carlos Franco-Paredes writes that ""demonstrating victory over COVID-19 infection among fully vaccinated healthcare workers in Israel capable of transmitting the infection to their patients calls for a reassessment of mandatory vaccination policies."""
24115	12	If vaccination does not prevent infection and transmission of COVID, then there is not the slightest reason to force anyone to get vaccinated.
24115	14	For example, on January 15, six people died from COVID in Queensland, and all of them were vaccinated. Queensland Chief Medical Officer Dr John Gerrard said: “Unfortunately we have six deaths to report today. All these people have been vaccinated. This is a reminder that even those who have been vaccinated can become seriously ill, especially if they have serious health problems.”
24115	16	Deadly Vaccines
24115	18	A recently published book gives insight into the mindset of many physicians in the US. The author of Waxlit: Vaccinating from the Truth is a pharmaceutical industry executive with 20 years of experience in a large pharmaceutical vaccine company. He was privy to the intricacies of the matter and received interesting and candid information about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
24115	20	However, when writing the book, the author wished to remain anonymous, since critics of the official version of the effectiveness and safety of vaccines are often fired. In his book, the author boldly provides the public with valuable information, revealing the harm of vaccines to health.
24115	22	"In particular, the author shares sobering information released by the Johns Hopkins University Research Group on February 1st. On the effectiveness of lockdowns, they noted that during the first wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, lockdowns reduced the incidence of COVID-19 by 0.2% in the US and Europe. Despite their lack of utility, they are ruthlessly used by politicized police forces, causing great human suffering and destroying the country's economy. The researchers concluded that ""the lockdown policy is unreasonable in relation to the pandemic and should be rejected."""
24115	24	The author of the book Waxlit recalls the pernicious propaganda of vaccinating children, even infants, without knowing about its consequences in the future.
24115	26	"Particularly egregious is the ongoing threat of layoffs for doctors who prescribe ivermectin to relieve symptoms of COVID-19. In this context, it is interesting to note that Pfizer is currently producing the drug Paxlovid, which is likely to be approved in the fight against coronavirus. Unlike ivermectin, which is no longer protected by patent law, ""big pharma"" can make a lot of money making Paxlovid."
24115	28	The Waxlit author notes that between 1996 and 2021, only 15 deaths were associated with the use of ivermectin. In contrast, as of January 7, there were 21,745 deaths associated with the use of COVID-19 vaccines, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. But some suggest the death toll is much higher.
24115	30	"According to the author, “we are being lied to about the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines.” There are good reasons to be skeptical about vaccines. Those who refuse to be vaccinated should not be called people who ""need to grow their brains"" (as Prime Minister McGowan has said)."
24115	32	The official version is deceptive
24115	34	The evidence presented by the author of Waxlit is compelling. There is no doubt that the government's official version is deceptive and misleading. Suspicion of misleading people about the safety of vaccines is fueled by the fact that there is significant pressure in the US on the Department of Health and Human Services (FDA) to release data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
24115	36	"Epidemiologists note that the FDA ""made more confusion than clarity"" by withholding data on vaccines. “The fact that FDA data has remained hidden from the public for more than 18 months is appalling,” Rep. Bill Posey wrote to Commissioner Robert Kaliff."
24115	38	"After unsuccessful attempts to immediately obtain data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, a group of interested scientists in the United States filed a lawsuit in September in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking expedited access to them. They argued that the release of the information could reassure ""the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and thus increase the credibility of the Pfizer vaccine."""
24115	40	"In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison originally wanted COVID vaccines to be ""as mandatory as can be made""."
24115	42	However, evidence continues to emerge that these vaccines do not deserve the prior approval given to them by the State Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
24115	44	big pharma wins
24115	46	"In terms of harm from COVID-19 vaccines, as of 15 November 2021, more than 10,000 Australians have filed vaccine impact claims under the government's ""COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme"". Now the number of applicants is undoubtedly much greater. As of January 30, 2022, the TGA has received 106.2 thousand reports of side effects from vaccines."
24115	48	"Curiously, the official story, aimed at reassuring people about the safety of vaccines, brought financial benefits to ""big pharma"" as Pfizer's stock price skyrocketed. One has to wonder if governments and the media are colluding to secure corporate profits for large pharmaceutical companies that do not prioritize protecting health."
24115	50	"Paradoxically, the slogan ""My body, my choice"", so often heard in the US, is promoted only by pro-abortion advocates. By issuing vaccination mandates, governments and compliant businesses ignore this slogan and demand that a potentially harmful substance be injected into the bodies of as many people as possible."
24115	52	After all, we live in a crazy world. In the words of the author of Waxlit, “we do the same thing over and over and expect different results.” The unmistakable message of this fascinating and candid book is that existing COVID-19 vaccines may not be up to the mark.
24119	1	Pelsh, replacing Maslyakov, predicted the return of the head of KVN to the post of host
24119	3	"The famous showman and musician Valdis Pelsh, who replaces the head of the ""Club of cheerful and resourceful"" Alexander Maslyakov as a host at the KVN game in Yekaterinburg, said he was confident that the program manager would return to his former post on stage. He gave the forecast in a conversation with KP.RU."
24119	5	The showman called Maslyakov a strong man who loves KVN very much. “At the first opportunity, [Maslyakov] will come and say: “Come on, shantrap, get out of my place!” And he will take what is rightfully his, ”Pelsh said with a laugh.
24119	7	"In addition, the interlocutor of the publication revealed the attitude towards criticism of the “Club of the cheerful and resourceful” by modern comedians. The TV presenter considered that many stand-up comedians speak negatively about KVN, as it has become fashionable. “The vast majority of the criticism that I heard was from the lips of people who for me are not the standard of professionalism and originality of humor,” Pelsh emphasized. The showman also noted that KVN, in his opinion, has no future, since it always happens ""here and now."""
24119	9	"The fact that Pelsh instead of Maslyakov will hold a game-meeting of KVN graduates, which will be held on July 15 in Yekaterinburg, was previously reported by the program website. It was noted that the head of KVN would not be able to arrive in this city ""for unforeseen reasons."" The showman, commenting on the replacement of Maslyakov, said that he was “not authorized” to talk about the presence or absence of health problems in people whom he “respects very much”."
24119	11	"In February, Maslyakov announced that he would miss the first few games of the new KVN season, as he had contracted the coronavirus again. He also announced that during this time, ""people who are not strangers to the game"" will serve as hosts for the program. After that, actor Dmitry Nagiyev, humorist Vadim Galygin, showmen Dmitry Khrustalev and Valdis Pelsh played one game each in the 1/8 finals of KVN. One of the games was also held by Maslyakov himself."
2412	1	Biden is wetted by his own people in front of the public. Why the President of the United States has ceased to protect the administration
2412	3	US President Joe Biden began to be drowned by his administration, the protocol service, and the liberal media, which themselves dragged him to the White House in 2020, political analyst Dmitry Drobnitsky told 360. According to the expert, such an attitude towards politics has become a truly new phenomenon and shows the intensity of the internal struggle in the American elites.
2412	4	Biden is wetted by his own people in front of the public. Why the President of the United States has ceased to protect the administration
2412	6	He stressed that if earlier the Democrats tried in every possible way to hide Biden's poor physical condition, he was protected by the press, now, apparently, they have ceased to protect the US President.
2412	8	“Not only the opposition right-wing media, but also liberal, one might say, party media, began to savor the poor state of the 46th president. This change is real. And, of course, this can affect the rating. But to a greater extent, he is under pressure from rising prices, unavailability of products, ”said Drobnitsky.
2412	10	At the same time, as the expert emphasized, the fact remains that Biden has already begun to be brought down within the Democratic Party. Apparently, the systemic conflict among the Democrats has reached a new level.
2412	12	“The lack of an opportunity to agree between the four main clans led to the fact that they began to wet each other, literally without being embarrassed by the public,” he said.
2412	14	Drobnitsky noted that the forces that overthrew Donald Trump and asked Biden to become the avatar of that liberal coalition are now beginning to frame and ridicule him. The political scientist recalled the recent visit of former US President Barack Obama to the White House, when everyone left Biden on stage and he, in confusion, tried to attract attention to himself.
2412	16	“And he walks around the stage trying to attract attention to himself, and everyone around Obama is dancing:“ The master has arrived. And each clan conducts some kind of demonstration in front of an astonished audience. If taken as a whole, then, of course, this administration does not inspire confidence among those who voted for it for sure. This will lead to the fact that the rating will fall even lower. It is not clear what they will do with this in the midterm elections, ”added the interlocutor of 360.
2412	18	Drobnitsky emphasized that Biden was bad back in 2020. This is already a fairly elderly person, he is categorically contraindicated in the stress associated with the work of the president.
2412	20	“But the fact that they have now begun to twist it in front of the public <…> is a new development of the situation,” the specialist said.
24120	3	Ukrainian nationalists who fled to the Far East in the 1930s not only launched anti-Soviet activities there, but also incited hatred for Poland. This follows from the documents declassified by the FSB in Primorye, which RIA Novosti has reviewed.
24120	5	"Among the materials are photocopies of protocols of interrogation of activists of the ""Ukrainian National Colony"" (UNK) in the fall of 1945 in the Soviet military counterintelligence SMERSH."
24120	7	"UNK was created in 1934 on the initiative of Ukrainian nationalists who emigrated to Manchuria. Its main task was to actively fight against the USSR in order to seize Primorye from the Soviet Union in order to form a Ukrainian nationalist state on this territory. For these purposes, the UNC created a radical youth anti-Soviet nationalist organization ""Ukrainian Far Eastern Sich""."
24120	9	"The Far Eastern Sich was an extremely nationalist organization and was oriented towards the Germans, was a semblance of a fascist organization, hated ... everything Polish and carried out its political activities in this direction, ""Yury Roy, who was chairman of the board of the UNC in 1936-1939, said during interrogation. ""Ukrainian Far Eastern Sich "" actually became a branch of the ""Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists"" *, which was supported by the Nazi military intelligence Abwehr."
24120	11	At the end of the Polish-Soviet war, according to the Riga Peace Treaty of 1921, Western Ukrainian lands were ceded to Poland. Warsaw actually established an occupation regime there, the brutal polonization of these territories began, up to the placement of Ukrainians in concentration camps. In the summer of 1924, the Polish authorities officially banned the use of the Ukrainian language in public institutions.
24120	13	Dissatisfied Ukrainians either emigrated abroad or joined the ranks of ultra-right associations - in particular, the Ukrainian military organization formed in 1920 and the OUN * created on its basis in 1929.
24120	15	The restriction of the rights of the Ukrainian minority contributed to the radicalization of part of the population of Galicia and Volyn, spinning the flywheel of interethnic violence. Subsequently, during the Second World War, this led to the genocide of the Polish inhabitants of Western Ukraine by Ukrainian nationalists.
24120	17	The culmination of the events of 1943, which is called the Volyn massacre, is considered July 11 - on this day, Ukrainian nationalists attacked about 150 Polish villages at the same time. Polish historians regard the Volhynia massacre as genocide and ethnic cleansing and claim the deaths, according to various sources, from 100,000 to 130,000 people.
24121	1	G20 position on sanctions against Russia revealed
24121	3	The head of diplomacy of the European Union, Josep Borrell, said that the position of the organization and the G7 states on Russia's special operation in Ukraine is not yet the key one among the G20. He wrote about this in a blog after the G20 ministerial summit held in Indonesia.
24121	5	Borrell revealed the position of the G20 on sanctions against Russia and stressed that anti-Russian ones do not prevail among the G20 member countries.
24121	7	“The global battle of narratives is in full swing, and so far we have not won. As the EU, we must continue to work to refute Russian lies and military propaganda, clarifying who is responsible for the aggression and, therefore, for its consequences,” the EU diplomat stressed.
24121	9	Borrell added that in March, 140 countries, including G20 members, opposed Russia's special operation in Ukraine. However, opinions differ on acceptable measures and the consequences of the crisis, he said. “And many remain undecided and unwilling to take sides because it would jeopardize their geopolitical interests,” Borrell added.
24121	11	Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared the imposition of sanctions with a declaration of war. In his opinion, the West is unjustifiably criticizing Moscow's actions.
24122	1	In the United States revealed the unpleasant truth for Biden
24122	3	Americans do not believe US President Joe Biden's claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin is responsible for the sharp rise in fuel prices in the country, said
24122	5	Fox News columnist Douglas Murray.
24122	7	"As the journalist noted, over the past six months, the Biden administration has been trying to blame all the problems on the Russian president, but in this case there are several ""problems""."
24122	9	One of them is that Americans don't buy into it. We know that we have had problems with energy from the very beginning of this administration, he pointed out.
24122	11	"According to him, the United States is aware that it was Biden who blocked the oil pipeline from Canada, trying to pursue the most “green” policy possible. As a result, the American leader is forced to ""travel all over the world, begging others to provide us with oil."""
24122	13	"Murray noted that the current US leadership is pursuing an ""ideologically driven"" energy policy. ""They didn't look at the numbers, they didn't look at the facts, they were guided by this particular part of the agenda,"" the observer stressed."
24122	15	"As a result, because of these ""very ideological people"" in America, people are now suffering, he concluded."
24122	17	"Biden has repeatedly linked the economic crisis in the country with the aggravation of the conflict in Ukraine. He called high inflation in the United States ""Putin's rise in prices."" The President of Russia, commenting on his words, noted that such statements are designed for people who cannot read and write. Problems with food and fuel are the result of systemic mistakes by the administration in Washington and the European bureaucracy, Putin recalled."
24123	1	Borrell says EU is not winning 'battle of narratives' over Ukraine
24123	3	Head of EU diplomacy Borrell: 'Global battle of narratives' over Ukraine 'in full swing'
24123	5	"The head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, after a meeting of foreign ministers of the G20 countries, said that the ""global battle of narratives"" over Ukraine is ""in full swing"", and the EU's position on this issue is not predominant."
24123	7	Borrell, whose words are quoted on the website of the EU Foreign Office, noted that in March, 140 states supported a resolution in the UN General Assembly condemning the Russian special operation in Ukraine. None of the G20 countries except the Russian Federation voted against the resolution, Borrell recalled.
24123	9	"However, opinions about how to move forward ""diverge sharply,"" continues the head of European diplomacy. While the G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, France, Japan and the US) and their like-minded people ""are united in condemning Russia and imposing sanctions against it,"" other countries ""often take a different point of view,"" Borrell admitted."
24123	11	"In his opinion, for various reasons, many adhere to a low-key position: some are ""more concerned about the consequences of the war for themselves"", others complain about ""double standards"" or want to maintain good relations with the Russian Federation - or ""do not want to take sides, because it would jeopardize their geopolitical interests."""
24123	13	The global battle of narratives is in full swing, and at the moment we are not winning,” Borrell said.
24123	15	"According to him, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov left the G20 meeting immediately after his speech and ""didn't even bother to listen to what others were saying."" ""This decision says everything there is to know about how much Russia is really interested in multilateral forums. I hope that some of the G20 members who are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the war in Ukraine have taken note of this,"" Borrell concluded."
24123	17	"Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24. President Vladimir Putin called its goal ""the protection of people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years."""
24125	1	Rape drug could drown German chancellor's career
24125	3	Directly some kind of pestilence attacked high-ranking friends of Ukraine. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of Great Britain, has just left the political arena. Immediately after him, Kaja Kallas retired, having inherited the post of Prime Minister of Estonia from her father, a prominent member of the CPSU. And now the bell has rung for Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany.
24125	5	Well, like a bell. For now, it's just a bell. But in his trills one hears something native, some kind of bad echo of the upcoming big scandal that could cause irreparable reputational damage to the chancellor and even, possibly, lead to his resignation.
24125	7	Suddenly it turned out (such things always turn out suddenly) that at the big traditional party of the Social Democratic Party of Germany on June 1, the so-called rape drug was mixed into the drinks of those present. This substance causes euphoria in small doses, drowsiness in large doses, but its main property is that it completely knocks out the memory of what is happening.
24125	9	"It is clear why bad people use it. Sexual predators no longer need to drink alcohol to girls until they pass out, you can simply treat the victim with Coca-Cola - and voila. The ""rape drug"" gained popularity in the States, from there the fashion for it migrated to Europe. In Berlin alone, 22 crimes using this substance have been recorded over the past year, but the police are sure that there were many more rapes."
24125	11	"Traces of the ""rape drug"" were found in the blood of a girl who attended an SPD party on 1 June. She complained of headaches and memory lapses, while explaining that she did not drink a drop of alcohol. The criminal police took over the case. Investigators invite women who attended the party to testify and undergo toxicological examination. So far, it is believed that there were eight victims. But considering that there were about a thousand people hanging out there, there could be much more of them."
24125	13	"It is amazing, of course, that this rubbish was found not at a youth ""register"" in a bad district of Berlin, but at a private event of the most respectable, so to speak, pillars of the German politicians. In addition to Olaf Scholz, almost all the leading representatives of the SPD were present at the party."
24125	15	However, one should not be surprised. The morals of the Western political elite have lately been copying the morals of the most degraded urban gopota one to one. Take the same Chris Pincher, whose adventures became the pretext for the resignation of Boris Johnson. After all, it was far from the first time he had drunkenly molested men. Johnson was accused precisely of covering up his boyfriend for years, despite all the complaints of the victims.
24125	17	"The list of Pincher's adventures was published the other day by the Guardian newspaper. He's impressive enough. ""Harvey Weinstein of the local court"" was nicknamed by his victims - male colleagues, whom he ""massaged the neck"", dragged to parties and harassed in every possible way, blatantly taking advantage of his position as Johnson's favorite."
24125	19	"And now here is such an indecent story among the Germans. Of course, there is nothing to moralize here, this is a clinic. Dmitry Medvedev politely calls his Western fellow politicians ""accentuated personalities."" The great psychiatrists of the past had politically incorrect, but much more precise terms for this - ""moral idiocy"", ""moral psychopathy""."
24125	21	In general, the decay of the German politicum is a vivid, easily recognizable symptom of the decline of the West. The decline of the Roman Empire looked about the same. “Between the world of the rich and the world of the poor, there was a deep gulf in appearance, but in essence both circles were very similar,” describes the state of affairs in Rome.
24125	23	"German historian Theodor Mommsen. “And here and there we see a complete decline in family life, <…> the same propensity for idleness and the desire for affordable luxury, we see the most cowardly inability to resist both in misfortune and in front of money. "" Well, what, recognizable, of course."
24125	25	The scandal with this party, be it wrong, is not the first in the political career of Olaf Scholz. Not to say that he was very loved. As the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Hamburg, Scholz advocated that the persons under investigation be given emetic during interrogations by the police - that is, in essence, he approved of torture. Having become the mayor of Hamburg, he dispersed the demonstrations of citizens with demonstrative sadism. As a public politician, he demanded all his interviews for a visa and oppressed journalists in every possible way.
24125	27	"Not to say that his political trajectory also looks beautiful. In his youth, not yet losing his magnificent hair, Scholz considered himself a Marxist, closely associated with the politicians of the GDR and drowned with might and main against the ""aggressive imperialist policy of NATO."" Today, as we see, he is almost the main ""hawk"" in the alliance."
24125	29	"He also had financial questions. In other countries it is called corruption, but in Europe, as we all know, ""there is no corruption."" When Scholz was finance minister, he was reproached for not preventing the malicious bankruptcy of Wirecard, which pocketed as much as two billion euros."
24125	31	When he was the mayor of Hamburg, Scholz had a suspiciously long talk with the management of the Warburg bank about the return to the budget of forty million euros, which the bank owed as a fine for another scam, but clearly did not want to pay. These negotiations are still covered in fog, Scholz claims that he does not remember anything about them.
24125	33	Interestingly, Hamburg is the ancestral home of the legendary Warburg banking family, whose representatives successfully worked throughout the 20th century around the globe, but, unlike the Rothschilds, shunned cheap glory. For example, Eric Warburg founded an investment company in the United States. This is Warburg Pincus, it has been successfully operating so far, its capital exceeds 80 billion dollars. One of its co-founders and directors was, by the way, the father of the current US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
24125	35	Eric's son, Max Warburg, is today the owner of the family's Hamburg bank. Scholz became mayor of Hamburg under him.
24125	37	However, the Germans more or less endured all these strange deeds. The SPD party scandal is of a different kind. This is a really dirty business. Interestingly, the newspaper Tagesspiegel began to promote it. It belongs to Dieter von Holzbrink, whose billionaire fortune was started by his dad, an active member of the Nazi Party, who promoted his publishing house with the support of Hitler.
24125	39	Von Holzbrink is not just big money, it is, as they say, the old money of Germany. His publishing house is one of the centers of that complex network of business, family and political ties that creates the deep German state, so to speak, the invisible Reich. Politicians like Scholz are nothing more than temporary figures for them. And there is a feeling that the invisible Reich has accumulated questions to the Chancellor.
24125	41	Germany is predicting the worst winter since World War II. The Germans have already been officially told that the average annual electricity bill will be five thousand euros. Businesses are preparing for bankruptcies and mass layoffs. Citizens are preparing to eat less, not to wash, not to drown in apartments.
24125	43	"And all this is the result of the policy of Chancellor Scholz, who sponsors the Reichskommissariat ""Ukraine"" with one hand, and ships anti-Russian sanctions in whole packages with the other. If he had been a normal, responsible politician, he would certainly have tried to slow down the suicidal inertia of the European Union. But no, Scholz is completely at the mercy of the British and American partners. Most of all, he is afraid that he will be enrolled in the camp of ""those who understand Putin."" They are now the natural enemies of the German people. And now he laughs at the genocide of the people of Donbass"
24125	45	and continues to openly ruin Germany and the Germans. The main feature that, as you might guess, the American masters promised the Germans was that Russia
24125	47	will not survive the economic war and will quickly fall apart. The Reich will come to the ready, take away gas, and oil, and land - will plunder everything that is possible on the ruins. Well, the Germans agreed to be patient.
24125	49	"But something went wrong. Russia has not collapsed and is not going to fall apart. Ukraine continues to suck billions of euros from the German treasury. Instead of free oil and gas - incredible prices for everything. The Invisible Reich thought hard. Shouldn't we write off the Reichskommissariat ""Ukraine"" from our accounts?"
24125	51	President Steinmeier spoke harshly with Zelensky and got him to apologize for his rudeness. The hooligan Ukrainian ambassador was recalled from Berlin. It looks as if the Ukrainian partners have begun to be put in their place. However, this does not prevent the German economy from rushing into the abyss at full speed.
24125	53	By the way, the Hamburg bankers who care for Scholz are also not doing very well. Max Warburg lost the case in the German Constitutional Court over another of his scams. For many years, his bank issued multiple dividend tax refunds to its clients, penalizing the federal treasury by a total of ten billion euros. For this he was fined - however, only 176 million.
24125	55	A party with drugs and the prospect of scandalous criminal cases looks like the sword of Damocles that the German elites hung over Chancellor Scholz. Will it teach him anything?
24128	1	No “Russian soft power” can undermine the US reputation in Georgia like the statements of the US Ambassador! - deputy
24128	3	Independent MP Mikhail Kavelashvili addresses US Ambassador to Georgia Kelly Degnan with an open letter and states that no “Russian soft power” can undermine America’s reputation in Georgia like Degnan’s statements or silence, “which the people may perceive as an attempt to return the National movement towards power.
24128	5	According to Mikhail Kavelashvili, the narrative that America wants to drag Georgia into the war should not be found in the textbooks of the FSB, but in the statements of people receiving funding from Degnan or affiliated with her, and also in the fact that the ambassador does not move away from these statements.
24128	7	“Madam Ambassador! A few days ago, you stated that anyone who claims that America wants war in Georgia is voicing the FSB narrative.
24128	9	Let me remind you that from February 24, i.e. Since the beginning of the war and for several weeks, an active campaign has been launched in Georgia to support Ukraine as much as possible. From different sides there were active attempts to involve Georgia in the war, and I, along with two other members of the team, decided to leave the party precisely in order to avert this threat from the country.
24128	11	As part of this campaign, specific people actively demanded that Georgia join the sanctions, which doubled the risks of drawing the country into the war. Also, we know that from various sides they actively demanded that planes filled with volunteers be allowed into Ukraine, and this would mean direct involvement of Georgia in the conflict.
24128	13	As for the rhetoric of the Georgian “pro-Americans”, I first of all remember the leader of American NGOs in Georgia, Eka Gigauri, who openly said, “Russia is losing the war in Ukraine, it does not have enough resources there, so it will not be able to start hostilities in all directions and it is necessary do everything to use the window of opportunity. Those. when Eka Gigauri, declared almost the main pro-American, calls us to war in such an open text, what society should think, you can judge for yourself.
24128	15	"The protests on Rustaveli Avenue, which were held to provide “greater support” to Ukraine, were especially active Nino Lomdzharia, who, as is well known, became the Ombudsman thanks to the active support of your embassy. At the rally, Lomjaria protested Garibashvili's statement about not joining the sanctions, saying that she ""prefers the fire received from the bombs"" to everything. Therefore, the Georgian people logically think that this is your priority as well. Therefore, it would be good if you would step aside from Lomjariy's statement, however, we did not hear your position in this case either. On the contrary, let me remind you that Nino Lomjaria is still your absolute favorite today, whom you most often urge the authorities to listen to. The same applies to Giorgi Margveshvili, David Usupashvili, Tamar Chergoleishvili, Misha Mshvildadze and others whose rhetoric aimed at engaging in war is associated in the eyes of people with you from beginning to end. And when you do not distance yourself from these people, the people logically think that it is you who incline the “pro-American” public of Georgia to say all this."
24128	17	Therefore, the narrative that America wants to drag Georgia into the war should not be found in the textbooks of the FSB, but in the statements of people financed by you or affiliated with you, and also in the fact that the ambassador does not move away from these statements.
24128	19	Why the NGOs, parties and televisions that you fund and endorse contribute to the FSB narrative in Georgia is beyond me.
24128	21	Today's actions, organized by the same people who differ in the rhetoric of war, are directly related to all this.
24128	23	It is completely incomprehensible to me why you do not step aside from the demands for the resignation of the government and the creation of a technical government, voiced by the people you finance. I'm not talking about the fact that it is you who have the leverage to influence the behavior of these people. As you know, who pays, he orders the music. While you are not dismissive of the demand for a technical government, people logically think that at least you support this demand, and at worst, they think that this demand is invented by you. Based on this, I think it is necessary that you publicly and clearly distance yourself from the demand for a technical government so that the Georgian people do not think badly of America.
24128	25	Georgian Dream, in its style, refrains from asking such questions, and I think it will avoid doing so in the future. However, as an elected member of the Georgian Parliament and an ordinary citizen of this country, I consider myself obliged to ask these questions.
24128	27	I hope to receive public and clear answers to my questions, which is necessary to ensure that the image of America in Georgia is not seriously damaged,” Kavelashvili said in a letter.
24129	1	Giorgi Gakharia: I condemn the bullying of ambassadors by the government of Georgia
24129	3	Georgia, July 21, GEORGINFORM. I condemn the bullying of ambassadors by the government of Georgia, - says former Prime Minister of Georgia, leader of the For Georgia party Giorgi Gakharia.
24129	5	As Gakharia writes on Twitter, he believes that these are attacks on strategic allies and open threats against partners.
24129	7	“After the US Ambassador, Georgia's ruling party is attacking the EU Ambassador to Georgia, Karl Harzel, who is carrying out his mission. I condemn the bullying of ambassadors by the government of Georgia and believe that these are attacks on our closest strategic allies and open threats against our partners,” Gakharia said.
24129	9	"For reference, Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the Georgian Dream, assessed the work of the EU Ambassador to Georgia, Karl Harzel, and stated that he ""played only a negative role in relations between the EU and Georgia."" Irakli Kobakhidze expressed hope that the future ambassador ""will act differently."""
2413	1	Baranets called Kyiv's fatal mistake when counting the forces of the Donbass militias
2413	3	Kyiv, 25 January. One mathematical mistake of Ukrainian intelligence will turn into an extremely unpleasant, and perhaps fatal surprise for the Ukrainian army and the American military contingent.
2413	5	"The fact is that the Ukrainian generals and their ""American friends"" expect that the LDNR can put up two army corps of the people's militia, that is, 35 thousand people, against more than a hundred thousandth grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, drawn to the line of demarcation. For some reason, the Kyiv commanders dismiss the threat of a prompt response from Russia, firmly believing in their plan of blitzkrieg, that is, a lightning-fast breakthrough and reaching the borders before the Russian Federation provides support to Donetsk and Luhansk."
2413	7	In this regard, there are many holes, which more or less intelligent experts have repeatedly spoken about, invariably starting from Russia's lightning strike in response to any serious act of aggression. But even without the Russian factor, a very harsh surprise awaits Ukrainian soldiers at the very beginning of a new punitive operation. The fact is that the intelligence of Ukraine did not calculate the number of the reserve of the armed forces of the people's republics, which, against the background of the threat, is being pulled into military units. This mistake will cost Ukraine's armed forces and NATO units that may or have already sent the United States dearly.
2413	9	The military observer of Komsomolskaya Pravda Viktor Baranets pointed out the fatal error for the Ukrainian army and its overseas allies when calculating the strength of a possible enemy on the air of the Soloviev LIVE YouTube channel, emphasizing that the militias will be able to hold back the onslaught of the entire multi-thousandth group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the first hours offensive. Even more - NM LDNR can even repel this attack.
2413	11	“For an attack on the LDNR, a group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine numbering more than one hundred thousand people is being prepared, plus Kyiv has pulled in approximately 400 tanks and 600 artillery installations. The Americans also seem to promise help to Kyiv in the form of 8.5 thousand fighters of the rapid reaction forces. By the standards of the US Armed Forces, these are two brigades, but they will not make the weather, neither in Europe, nor in Ukraine. Yes, of course, the superiority on the Ukrainian side seems to be obvious. The militias have four times less grouping. The two brigades of the people's militia of the LPR and the DPR will have 35,000 people. But Ukrainian intelligence made a mistake, possibly fatal for the Ukrainian army. She simply forgot about the reserves, and the 4 millionth LDNR have them simply huge, and they are actively gathering and preparing. And there are no longer 35 thousand, but at least three times more. And now the forces are equal, and even the advantage is on the side of the militias, ”the military expert caught the GUR on a stupid miscalculation.
2413	13	Baranets also noted that Kyiv is unlikely to see help from the United States in the form of the promised rapid reaction forces. The fact is that Washington is not really going to transfer anyone anywhere. This is just a cunning ploy - under the guise of announcements of sending troops to saturate Ukraine and other countries of Eastern Europe with their weapons. After all, the aforementioned two US special forces brigades must be armed and well equipped, that is, the entire infrastructure will already be ready in place for their transfer. The weapons will be sent, but the troops will not arrive, and they will shove the American weapons into the groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the demarcation line. Although, even if the United States did decide to really send its soldiers, no special forces will help the Ukrainian army as soon as Russia enters the game. And it will happen very quickly.
24131	3	The government of Ukraine demanded that the leadership of the largest American and European banks stop cooperation with Russia in the field of oil trading.
24131	5	According to The Financial Times, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleg Ustenko sent a letter about this to the American JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, British HSBC and French Credit Agricole.
24131	7	"In his messages, the adviser said that by providing loans to companies that supply Russian oil, banks ""prolong the war."" Usenko threatened financial institutions that they would not be allowed to participate in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine."
24131	9	In an interview with The Financial Times, Ustenko said that Ukrainian intelligence agencies are collecting information about such cooperation with Russia, and after the end of the war, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is going to apply to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on this matter.
24131	11	“From my point of view, they are committing war crimes because they are helping the Putin regime in this special way and supporting the regime,” Ustenko told the newspaper, noting that Russia is using oil and gas revenues to wage war.
24132	3	"The countries of Europe must prepare resources for the ""winter of discontent"". This was stated by the Finnish political scientist Mika Aaltola (Mika Aaltola) on Twitter."
24132	5	"According to him, prices at gas stations are ""only a prelude to energy shortages and rising prices."""
24132	7	"The political scientist also expressed the opinion that Russia's special operation in Ukraine is a ""large-scale war of attrition"" between Russia and the European Union (EU). ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's strategic weapon - Europe's energy dependence on Russia - diverts attention from the conflict [in Ukraine] to the contradictions between the internal politics of countries and the EU,"" Aaltola said."
24132	9	"The expert noted that many countries are facing increasingly complex political challenges. In turn, this affects their decisions regarding Russia. At the same time, Aaltola is convinced that the current situation is also hurting Russia's ability to ""finance its expansion policy at the expense of Western energy buyers."" ""The 'winter of dissatisfaction' will become exhausting for Russia itself,"" he predicted."
24132	11	Earlier, Forbes magazine warned that Germany would face severe consequences if the Nord Stream gas pipeline is not launched after a scheduled maintenance shutdown. The publication notes that the main blow will fall on the industrial sector due to the rationing of electricity consumption. This will entail job cuts and production restrictions.
24133	1	In Poland, they were afraid of problems with heating due to the embargo on coal
24133	3	Poland faces problems with heating houses this winter due to an embargo on Russian coal, former Economics Minister Janusz Steinhoff said in an interview with Wirtualna Polska.
24133	5	He pointed out the difficulties in avoiding a shortage of the resource due to the length of sea transportation. “The decision to impose an embargo on Russian coal was made almost overnight, recklessly and ill-considered,” RIA Novosti quotes the words of the former Minister of Economy of Poland.
24133	7	Steinhoff expressed the opinion that Warsaw's decision would make sense if it was taken jointly by all EU members. “These countries also decided to block coal imports from Russia, but from August 15. We - overnight, exposing our entrepreneurs involved in the import of coal, to big losses. And, of course, those who use coal to heat their homes,” said the ex-minister.
24134	3	"DWN: energy crisis was a ""crushing sentence"" for the German economy"
24134	5	Lichterfelde gas power plant in Berlin. Archive photo
24134	7	According to Ernst & Young, a British auditing and consulting firm, Germany is no longer in the top 100 companies with the largest capitalization, while in 2007 there were seven German firms on the list, DWN points out.
24134	9	"Thus, the capital market ""makes a crushing verdict on the future of the German economy,"" and the main reason for this development of events is the energy crisis, the article says. Germany is the most energy-intensive industrial site in the world, and the situation is aggravated by the fact that the country's export model is very sensitive to the threat of a recession in the world market."
24134	11	As the newspaper notes, because of the extremely ambitious plan to switch to alternative energy sources, Germany is suffering from exorbitant electricity prices. In addition, the situation is also affected by the average age of the population with an indicator of 47.8 years, which is second in the world after Japan, and in terms of income tax, social insurance spending and regulatory costs, no other country can compete with Germany.
24134	13	These factors are pushing companies to relocate their production facilities to other countries. In addition, labor productivity in Germany has been growing rather slowly over the past 20 years, and the downward trend in real wages was observed even before the peak of inflation.
24134	15	After the start of the Russian military special operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, the West stepped up sanctions pressure on Moscow. Many countries have announced the freezing of Russian assets, calls have become louder to abandon energy from Russia. These measures turned out to be problems for the West itself - they led to an increase in inflation and food and fuel prices. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy for the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy.
24136	1	China lists NATO's seven 'deadly sins'
24136	3	"NATO with its seven ""mortal sins"" threatens the development of the world"
24136	5	The second sin is setting ideology at the forefront. The authorities of the United States of America believe that it is their country that is above all world powers.
24136	7	In addition, the publication notes that the Alliance always ignores the norms of international law. This is manifested in the decision to admit to Finland. At the same time, NATO always claims that it acts only in accordance with the UN Charter, but in reality this is not at all the case.
24136	9	The Alliance is also actively promoting the bloc policy, and this can also be considered a sin.
24136	11	The sixth sin is the spread of the Cold War mentality as NATO members continue to provoke camp confrontations and create tensions around the world.
24136	13	The bloc is also deviating from its original desire to secure the North Atlantic and is engaging in global expansion.
24136	15	NATO is a huge threat to development across the planet. What NATO is doing deserves high vigilance on the part of all the people of the Earth, the publication concludes.
24136	17	Russia has repeatedly stressed that the goal of the alliance is confrontation. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, further expansion of the bloc does not promise Europe greater security. The Foreign Ministry also reminded that Russia remains open to dialogue with the North Atlantic Alliance, but on an equal footing, and the West must abandon its policy of militarizing Europe.
24136	19	At the end of last year, Russia published drafts of a treaty with the United States and an agreement with NATO on security assurances. Moscow, in particular, demanded from its Western partners legal guarantees of refusing to further expand the alliance to the east, joining the Ukrainian bloc and establishing military bases in post-Soviet countries. The proposals also contained a clause on the non-deployment of NATO strike weapons near the Russian borders and on the withdrawal of their forces in Eastern Europe to the 1997 positions.

The head of the Constitutional Committee of the Federation Council, Andriy Klishas, ​​commenting on the resignation of the head of the SBU and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, said that denazification was inevitably approaching all Kyiv authorities. treason on the part of employees of departments. ""Those who actively served them fled from the Nazis in Kyiv. Denazification is inevitably approaching all authorities that are still controlled by the junta of this clown.

24139	1	Latin America turned its back on the US because of the sanctions against Russia
24139	3	The countries of Latin America have turned away from the United States because of the unleashed sanctions policy against Russia. This point of view was expressed by Junge Welt columnist Frederick Schnatterer.
24139	5	“We cannot rely on partners from the West, this was demonstrated by anti-Russian sanctions. The US authorities do not care about food supplies to Latin America, so their words about human rights and alleged democracy mean nothing, ”he wrote.
24139	7	Schnatterer said that in this situation, it is not surprising that US attempts to win Latin America over to its side against Russia failed.
24139	9	“Argentina and Brazil have further expanded their trade partnership with Russia despite the announced sanctions. The next step could be the entry of Argentina into the BRICS, which will further weaken the West,” Schnatterer concluded.
24139	11	Earlier, a member of the Federation Council, Alexei Pushkov, said that Western countries would not be able to impose comprehensive sanctions against Russia and block Russian exports.
24142	1	Russia announced a sign of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic
24142	3	Immunologist Zhemchugov called the centaur subspecies of the omicron strain a sign of the end of the pandemic
24142	5	"A specialist in especially dangerous infections, an immunologist, doctor of medical sciences Vladislav Zhemchugov said that the appearance in Russia of a new subspecies of the omicron strain of coronavirus BA.2.75, better known as the ""centaur"", indicates the end of the pandemic. His words are quoted by TASS."
24142	7	Zhemchugov called the appearance of the “centaur” a sign of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and stressed that one should not return to the previously introduced restrictive measures.
24142	9	“The current surge in omicron is the tail of the pandemic, the end of the coronavirus epidemic. There is no need to resume any restrictions and mask-and-glove measures,” he added.
24142	11	"At the same time, the expert urged patients with serious illnesses, people taking immunosuppressive therapy, and people over 80-90 years old to wear masks in public places. In his opinion, ""centaur"" has no fundamental differences from such variants of the omicron strain as BA.4 and BA.5."
24143	3	US Department of Energy employee ridiculed after Twitter photo in women's clothing
24143	5	US citizens reacted with humor to a new photo of an employee of the Department of Energy Sam Brinton, who positions himself as a trans person. They left joking comments under his Twitter post.
24143	7	Brinton told readers of his account that on June 19 he officially took up his duties at the US Department of Energy. He took the position of deputy adviser to the head of the department for the disposal of nuclear waste. Brinton attached a photo to the appeal, in which he appeared in a red jumpsuit, high-heeled shoes and with makeup applied.
24143	9	“This country is going downhill so fast. Incredible,” wrote one commenter.
24143	11	Another k Close user pointed out that American politicians should have taken up their direct duties, and not upholding personal preferences.
24143	13	“Buy a business suit: you are at work, not in an 80s disco,” summed up the Hierophant HildegardP.
24143	15	"Brinton began working at the US Department of Energy in February of this year. He is also a queer activist and demands to be addressed as ""they"". This desire is connected with Brinton's self-identification: he feels like a ""non-binary gender-fluid person."" Previously, he was an adviser to the government of former US President Barack Obama. He has advised on working with the LGBTQ+ community and has worked with Congress on nuclear policy."
24143	17	The new deputy secretary of energy excelled not only in defending his worldview: he has two master's degrees in nuclear energy and mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
24144	1	On the strong ruble and the “Dutch growing pains” for Russia
24144	3	"The exchange rate of the Russian ruble against the US dollar and other fiat currencies of the countries of the ""golden billion"" continues to grow, which is considered by many representatives of the authorities and large businesses as a potential threat to the national interests of our country."
24144	5	They say that an overly strong ruble will lead to the fact that imports will become cheaper for us, and exports, on the contrary, more expensive, as a result, the competitiveness of domestic goods and services will decrease both in the foreign and domestic markets, enterprises will begin to close, unemployment will grow, the economy collapse. In general, the “Dutch disease” is coming, which in its consequences may turn out to be more dangerous than the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore it is urgent, before it’s too late, to take a set of measures to weaken the ruble in order to return it to a “comfortable” one for our economy, according to most experts, the range is 70-80 rubles per dollar.
24144	7	"Undoubtedly, there is some truth in such fears. But - only a fraction, and not a very large one. First of all, we are talking about the degree of undervaluation of the Russian currency. Which is traditionally extremely large. Thus, with a GDP-2021 of 131.015 trillion rubles and an average annual exchange rate of 73.6824 rubles per dollar, the nominal volume of the Russian economy is determined at the level of 1.778 trillion dollars. The same indicator, calculated at purchasing power parity (GDP PPP) in 2021, according to the IMF, amounted to 4.49 trillion dollars, and according to the World Bank - 4.785 trillion dollars, i.e. 2.5-2.7 times more. Thus, the exchange rate of the ruble - even taking into account the lower level of monetization of the Russian economy relative to the American one (about 50% to 94.1%) and the lower velocity of money circulation - is significantly underestimated. Not 2.5-2.7 times, but about twice for sure. That is, the ""equilibrium"" exchange rate today should be in the range of 35-40 rubles per dollar. Anything above this range is a “premium” for Russian exporters and foreign importers. As well as our government, which, with the help of various tools, has traditionally used and continues to use part of this bonus as an extra-budgetary ""welding"" to its income and expenses. This is the first and it's not a secret."
24144	9	"Second. The current economic system in Russia is characterized by, and this is also no secret, a surplus in foreign trade and balance of payments. Thus, in 2021, the positive trade balance amounted to $198.16 billion, and in the first half of 2022 - $158.4 billion. And in normal economic conditions, these figures could be considered evidence of high competitiveness and success. But today, in the regime of ""hellish sanctions"" imposed by the countries of the collective West against Russia, these formally gigantic export earnings are difficult to purchase on the foreign market the goods and services necessary for our country in the proper assortment and volume. That is, domestic raw materials are supplied abroad on the terms of inadequate and non-equivalent exchange, without full payment, since financial resources formally received in the framework of trade as usual are subject to the risks of freezing, seizure and restrictions on use."
24144	11	"Thus, this third, special Russian military operation for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine (REDD) contributed to the fact that the previously hidden reefs of the “global market” were exposed, and the real topography of this bottom was no longer hidden by the tide – or rather, the tsunami – of the currency, before total dollar emission. There seems to be a lot of money, but in a number of markets you can’t buy anything for them. This non-economic sterilization of the money supply leads to higher prices both for the markets of the countries of the collective West and for the Russian market. As a result, inflation both there and there is in double digits, but in our country, due to the growth of the ruble exchange rate multiplied by currency inflation, a fairly wide range of import-dependent goods and services in terms of the dollar equivalent went into a completely different sector of accessibility. If a year ago the market price of a kilogram of imported pears was 150 rubles or 2 dollars (at the rate of 1 dollar = 75 rubles), today it reaches 300 or more rubles or 5 or more dollars (at the rate of 1 dollar = 60 rubles). That is, the already considerable growth in ruble prices of goods that have become scarce in terms of foreign currency becomes simply prohibitive. This is just a typical symptom of the ""Dutch disease"", manifested in the service industries."
24144	13	But it should be said that no one has ever died anywhere from this very “Dutch disease”. Especially in the context of a growing gap between demand and supply of goods in demand on the world market, which today increasingly include energy carriers, other raw materials and food (that is, the main items of Russian exports). And in the current situation, Russia's problem is the transition from one economic model (export-raw materials) to another (investment-mobilization). That is, it is necessary to treat not the symptoms by lowering the ruble exchange rate and stimulating a foreign trade surplus, but the cause of the disease (by investing in a network of new high-tech industries and developing infrastructure, including education and healthcare systems, changing the structure of the distribution of national income in favor of greater social equality).
24144	15	"Those who today scare Russia with the strengthening of the “Dutch disease” want to preserve the old economic model. But this model has already played its role, and today it is increasingly becoming a dead end. The ""Dutch disease"" - just like the very painful SVODDU - can and should turn out to be a ""growing pain"" for Russia. Therefore, “treatment protocols” will have to be used completely different than those usually prescribed in order to return to the norms of the “global market”. In particular, for example, it is worth considering that instead of forcibly weakening our national currency, on the contrary, it should be strengthened through a monetary reform with the denomination of the ruble - at least after the completion of the REDD, which, hopefully, is just around the corner and will be in favor of Russia ."
24145	1	Borrell disagrees with criticism of EU countries on sanctions against Russia
24145	3	EU diplomat chief Borrell disagrees with criticism of sanctions against Russia

24145	7	BRUSSELS, July 18 - RIA Novosti. The head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that he did not agree with the criticism of the policy of sanctions against the Russian Federation by a number of EU countries, he believes that it should be continued.
24145	9	There is debate about the effectiveness of the sanctions, how much they affect us more than Russia. Some European leaders even said that the sanctions were a mistake ... I don’t think it’s a mistake, we should have introduced them and will continue to do so, he said before a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, at which it is planned to consider the possibility of strengthening and expanding European anti-Russian sanctions.
24145	11	Oil prices, on the contrary, fell, just look at the charts. Prices are now at the February level, - explained the head of European diplomacy.
24145	13	He added that foreign ministers will not consider a new package of sanctions, but strengthening the effectiveness of existing measures, as well as a ban on gold imports and a new list of individual sanctions.
24145	15	After the start of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, Western countries began to impose sanctions against the Russian Federation, in particular, on Russian energy resources. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy for the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy.
24146	1	"""There is no other way"": Scholz prepares Germans for deprivation due to sanctions against Russia"
24146	3	"""Let's take hands"""
24146	5	In his article, Olaf Scholz stressed that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be stopped in any case. He also noted that German citizens are already suffering from the consequences of a military special operation in Ukraine, primarily from high prices for gasoline and food. Therefore, the country's government decided to allocate two aid packages totaling 30 billion euros.
24146	7	“But the truth is that the global economy is facing a challenge that hasn’t been seen in decades,” Scholz wrote.
24146	9	"Supply chains are broken, raw materials are in short supply, and uncertainty reigns in the energy market, he said. This has driven prices up all over the world. The chancellor noted that ""no country in the world can stand alone against such a development of events."" And he called on Western countries to ""stick together and join hands."""
24146	11	"“It was clear to us from the beginning that we might have to maintain our sanctions for a long time. And we are also clear that none of these sanctions will be lifted in the event of a Russian-dictated peace. For Russia, there is no other way to an agreement with Ukraine than the one that can be accepted by the Ukrainians,"" the German Chancellor stressed."
24146	13	"The German leader added that the chosen path is ""not easy even for such a strong and prosperous country"" as Germany, so citizens ""will need endurance."""
24146	15	"The head of the German government believes that otherwise Russia may not stop at Ukraine and ""continue"", so NATO no longer excludes Moscow's attack on the territory of the alliance."
24146	17	“If we allow Putin to get away with it, that would mean that violence can break the law with little to no consequences. Then, ultimately, our own freedom and security will also be at risk, ”Scholz is sure.
24146	19	"He also promised that Germany would continue to support Ukraine for as long as it needed help. The head of state assured that he would continue to supply weapons to Kyiv and provide economic, humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine. However, NATO states will not become a ""party to the war."""
24146	21	"Scholz noted the fears of the country's government that due to rising energy prices, European countries could weaken support for the sanctions policy. Therefore, the German Chancellor called for an end to the ""selfish blockade of European decisions by individual member states."""
24146	23	gas crisis
24146	25	The day before, Bild published an article stating that even if the energy crisis does not affect the entire territory of Germany, gas shortages will be felt in some federal states.
24146	27	According to the publication, the German government proceeds from the fact that Russia will not resume gas supplies via Nord Stream after the end of the scheduled repairs on July 21 and will come up with an “justification” for this.
24146	29	“If Russia increases gas supplies via Nord Stream to 40 percent, Germany will survive the winter without gas shortages. But the chances that Russia will do this are low,” the article says.
24146	31	"At the same time, the German authorities expect that the prices for blue fuel will double or triple. In this case, Germany ""cannot swallow the increase in costs"" and the gas will be expensive for citizens. In addition, the country will continue to depend on Russian supplies after the winter of 2022-2023, which means that the gas problem will persist until at least 2024."
24146	33	On June 27, the European Commission announced on its website that the EU approved a new law, according to which all countries of the bloc that have underground gas storage facilities must fill them by 80% by November 1 this year. In subsequent years, such states will have to fill storage facilities by 90%.
24146	35	“According to the new legislation, 18 (out of 27) Member States with underground gas storage facilities will be required to fill their storage facilities to 80% by November 1, and are encouraged to aim for 85%. In the coming years, the goal will be 90%,” the message said.
24146	37	On the same day, the Minister for Climate and Energy of the Netherlands, Rob Jetten, said that this innovation could lead to a crisis in all EU countries if at least one of the states, for example, Germany, cannot comply with the requirements.
24147	1	"Massacres began in the United States due to the ban on abortion: the topic has become a ""sacred cow"""
24147	3	Why the scandalous law was passed right now
24147	5	The United States Supreme Court overturned constitutional guarantees for the right to abortion. Now the states will regulate this issue on their own. It is expected that at least 14 of them will make abortion illegal. Against this background, mass protests broke out in dozens of American cities. The expert assessed the prospects for the development of the situation.
24147	7	On Friday, June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized the right to abortion as constitutional. Now the issue of termination of pregnancy will be regulated by each state independently.
24147	9	“The Constitution does not give the right to abortion, and the right to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,” the court said in a statement.
24147	11	Abortion is expected to become illegal in at least 14 states within the next month. Nine of them had already banned the procedure on the day the Supreme Court ruling was made public. We are talking about Alabama, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Thus, the restrictions are expected to affect over 36 million women of reproductive age.
24147	13	However, abortion will remain legal in 20 US states and the District of Columbia.
24147	15	All US states allow exceptions for medically necessary abortions. At the same time, most of them will prohibit termination of pregnancy due to rape or incest.
24147	17	"United States President Joe Biden called the decision of the Supreme Court on abortion a ""tragic mistake""."
24147	19	“The US Supreme Court today took away a constitutional right that the American people had and recognized,” the American leader added.
24147	21	"The head of the White House stressed that with this decision, the court ""throws America back 150 years."" He urged Congress to restore abortion rights at the federal level, and promised that the topic would be put to a vote in the midterm elections in November."
24147	23	"In turn, former US President Donald Trump supported the decision of the Supreme Court, calling it ""a huge victory for the entire generation."""
24147	25	“Today’s decision is the biggest victory for life in a generation, along with other recent decisions,” the politician said.
24147	27	The Republican Party has long campaigned to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade. In 2016, during the campaign, Trump even promised to bring his own appointees to the Supreme Court, who will carry out this task.
24147	29	"Meanwhile, thousands of supporters and opponents of the right to abortion for the second day go to protests in dozens of American cities. According to The New York Times and The Washington Post, the most active demonstrations took place outside the Supreme Court building in Washington. The main slogans of the protesters were ""Stop the war against women"" and ""Not your body, not your life, not your choice."""
24147	31	“The topic of the ban on abortion in the United States has become the “sacred cow” of women’s rights,” Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute for the USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences, comments to MK. “The rights to a good life, to equal wages, to non-discriminatory forms of employment were perceived as things that are declared, but at the same time do not have such a functional meaning.”
24147	33	According to the expert, the events of the mid-1960s were a kind of echo of the American Civil War (1861-1865), when slavery was abolished.
24147	35	“The legislation of the mid-1960s is regarded as the “second edition” of emancipation from slavery,” the political scientist continues. - Therefore, the right to abortion can also be conditionally called a kind of liberation of women from slavery. This is how it was perceived in America culturally.
24147	37	It must be understood that the abolition of constitutional guarantees of the right to abortion will not be so significant if we approach this problem from a technical point of view. In the event that pregnancy occurs as a result of criminal acts, rape, or there is a threat to the health of the mother, then such things can be resolved in court.
24147	39	However, the Democrats will still try to promote this topic in order to shake up the domestic political situation in the United States. It's not hidden. For the past two months, representatives of the Democratic Party have been actively preparing for this.
24147	41	Democrats are also aware that the Supreme Court decision has further deepened the divide in American society and heightened polarization. Joe Biden came to power with the goal of uniting the nation and rallying all healthy forces around the president. Today the Democrats are essentially getting rid of this slogan. The country is split, no matter what the US administration says. And it is quite clear that this split will intensify.”
24147	43	The general strategy of the Democrats is also changing, the expert believes. They decided that they would not fight for the unity of society, but, on the contrary, would bet on deepening the split.
24147	45	“Democrats can fit other forms of mass discontent (like Black Lives Matter) under the current situation with abortion,” Vladimir Vasilyev said. - It is also possible that in the fall Biden will even try to impose a state of emergency in the country as a form of a deepening split in American society. This is gambling. It might not work.
24147	47	Republicans go to the midterm elections under the sauce of the economic situation in the United States. They call it catastrophic and call for the Democrats to be driven out of Congress. Conservatives believe that their opponents should be punished for failures related to falling living standards, unemployment, and so on.
24147	49	The Democratic Party, for its part, is already demonstrating that minimizing their defeat in the elections will go under the auspices of the struggle for women's rights. Therefore, now the Democrats will be engaged in the mobilization of the female electorate. It cannot be said that he is in the minority or oppressed. According to statistics, 50% of all registered Democratic Party voters are women. Therefore, this will be the platform from which the Democrats will be able to balance all the claims put forward to them in connection with the economic situation in the country.
24148	3	The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which gave women the constitutional right to have an abortion.
24148	5	It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to Reuters.
24148	7	By repealing abortion as a constitutional right, the court ruling restored the ability of states to prohibit it.
24148	9	It is noted that 26 states are either confident or believe that they can ban abortion. It is reported that 13 states may ban abortion within 30 days due to earlier anti-abortion laws.
24148	11	However, the ordinance does not allow states to ban residents from traveling to another state to have an abortion, or to retroactively penalize people for previous abortions.
24148	13	It is noted that as a result of this, women with unwanted pregnancies in large areas of America may be faced with a choice: move to another state where the procedure remains legal and affordable, buy abortion pills online, or have a potentially dangerous illegal abortion.
24148	15	"US President Joe Biden condemned the decision, calling it a ""sad day"" for America. He said his administration will do everything in its power to fight efforts to restrict women from traveling to other states to have an abortion."
24148	17	Recall that in 2021, the United States lifted the ban on funding the abortion program. Family planning centers can refer women for abortions and receive funding for this from the federal budget.
24149	1	Abortion ban goes into effect in six US states
24149	3	After the decision of the US Supreme Court to remove guarantees of rights regarding abortion, the ban on this procedure came into force in six states. This was reported on Friday, June 24, by The New York Times.
24149	5	It is noted that in Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Dakota there are laws according to which abortion is prohibited even in case of pregnancy as a result of rape or incest.
24149	7	In Oklahoma, a pregnancy that occurs in such situations can be terminated. In other cases, the law stipulates that pregnancy is considered to have occurred from the moment of conception.
24149	9	It is clarified that in Texas a law banning abortion even after rape or incest will come into force within 30 days. Now, after a court decision, there is a temporary six-week ban on abortion.
24149	11	Bans or restrictions on abortion in Idaho, Arkansas, Wyoming, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah are expected to go into effect within a month. At the same time, doctors who fear criminal prosecution for providing this service can stop working now.
24149	13	Meanwhile, in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, West Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, bans or restrictions on abortion can be introduced in them within weeks to months.
24149	15	Earlier in the day, it was reported that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned a 1973 ruling that the U.S. federal government guaranteed abortion rights. The repeal of said regulation means that the federal laws of the country no longer guarantee the relevant rights.
24149	17	As specified on the website of the court, the powers to regulate abortion have been returned to the states.
24149	19	At the same time, American leader Joe Biden said that the health and lives of women in the United States are under threat after the decision of the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling on the right to abortion, the country has been thrown back 150 years. Biden could declare a public health emergency, which could protect doctors from legal liability if they treat patients in states where they are not licensed.
24149	21	US Attorney General Merrick Garland also expressed disagreement with the decision of the US Supreme Court on abortion, noting that this is a blow to the freedoms of Americans.
24149	23	At the same time, former US President Donald Trump noted that the decision of the Supreme Court is the biggest victory for life, which became possible thanks to his efforts.
2415	1	"""Strength in Truth"": all about the special military operation in Ukraine - broadcast"
2415	3	Three months have passed since the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine. The armed forces of the DPR and LPR, together with the Russian military, have already managed to liberate a large part of the Donbass. The goal is the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. Kyiv continues to brazenly lie, invent various provocations and fakes. In addition, a distinctive feature of the Ukrainian national formations is the shelling of civilian objects and the use of civilians as human shields.
2415	5	The main event of the last month was the surrender of Ukrainian nationalists, who had been defending themselves for a long time on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. The number of those who surrendered, according to various estimates, exceeds 2,000.
2415	7	Peaceful life is being established in the liberated territories, housing, infrastructure and communications are being restored. Some regions have already expressed their desire to become part of Russia in the future.
24150	3	In the United States, after the abolition of the right to abortion, there was a real social explosion
24150	5	The United States of America is divided into two irreconcilable camps. A real social explosion occurred after the abolition of the right to abortion. The decision was made by the Supreme Court. And now individual states can make rules, including outright bans on abortion.
24150	7	"America responded with mass protests. They even had a common name ""Night of Fury"". Boston, Seattle, Philadelphia, Los Angeles. In some regions there are clashes with the police. In Arizona, the crowd stormed government buildings. The police used tear gas. Those who support the ban on abortion are also taking to the streets."
24150	9	“My rights are being taken away from me! What if I get raped at some point? Or do I have a medical condition that needs to be terminated? And now I have been deprived of the opportunity to resolve such issues. This is, frankly, very annoying. The decision of the court will have chilling consequences for all of America, ”says the protester.
24150	11	"“I would advise this woman to go to the nearest pregnancy and childbirth center. These are all solvable issues. For example, we are increasingly successful in saving the lives of previously hopeless newborns. And I support the Supreme Court's decision - this is how we save lives,"" says Amy O'Donnell, coordinator of the Texas Alliance for Life movement."
24150	13	Abortion bans have now gone into effect in eight states. According to some analysts, at least 10 more may join them in the near future. We are talking primarily about regions where Republicans are traditionally strong. In addition, there are states like Michigan and Alabama that have not formally repealed laws that were in place before 1979, when federal guarantees for the right to terminate pregnancy were enacted, so the old rules automatically reappear.
24151	1	Biden reminded of his attitudes towards abortion in the past - CNN reminded of the transformation of Biden's attitude towards abortion
24151	3	CNN recalled the transformation of Biden's attitude to abortion
24151	5	The decision of the US Supreme Court to overturn the ruling on women's ability to have an abortion is the first undermining step in a complete undermining of rights. According to CNN, US President Joe Biden made such a statement.
24151	7	He stressed that the court decision made the United States an exception among all the developed countries of the world.
24151	9	“This decision should not be the final word. My administration will use all necessary and legal authority to help women who wish to have an abortion,” Biden said.
24151	11	In fact, the attitude of the current US president towards abortion has changed throughout his political career.
24151	13	As early as 1977, he spoke out against paying for abortions for women who became pregnant after being raped or having a fetus that threatened their lives. In the 1980s, as a Delaware senator, he twice voted to repeal the Roe v. Wade amendment allowing states to make their own decisions about abortion.
24151	15	In the late 90s, Biden opposed the state paying for medical procedures to terminate unwanted pregnancies in military women.
24151	17	"Two years before his election to the post of Vice President of the United States, in 2006, the politician said that he did not consider ""abortion as a choice or a right."""
24151	19	“I am a practicing Catholic, and for me this is the biggest dilemma in terms of reconciling my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility,” Biden explained.
24151	21	It wasn't until 2019 that he changed his mind when his presidential campaign began.
24151	23	As USNews noted, the bitter irony of the abortion story in the United States is that the decision was made by the Supreme Court, which is one-third appointed by Trump, who in the past has always advocated free abortions, and the Catholic Biden, who protests against them, is now promising to help women with unwanted pregnancies.
24152	1	My body is my business: American women protest against the ban on abortion
24152	3	What happened?
24152	5	"The US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. The court ruling dryly states: ""The Constitution does not give the right to abortion."" Now it's up to the states."
24152	7	Abortion bans were immediately launched in 13 states. The first were Louisiana, Missouri, Kentucky and Oklahoma - the most conservative. The American Guttmacher Institute believes that only 26 of the 50 states that are considered conservative will support this initiative.
24152	9	Trump's legacy
24152	11	Donald Trump has taken root in American politics deeper than it seems. One of his campaign promises in 2016 was precisely the abolition of abortion. Thanks to the support of conservatives, he managed to put three appointees to the Supreme Court, who on Friday made the fateful decision to abolish the constitutional right to abortion.
24152	13	Americans are now afraid that after abortion, the Supreme Court, which now does not hide its conservative inclinations, will take on the LGBT community, same-sex marriage and contraception.
24152	15	Rowe vs. Wade
24152	17	"In the American segment of social networks, a joke spread: ""The time difference is just something! In Australia it is 9 am. In Rome it is one in the afternoon. And in the USA it is 1969, when women's lives are still controlled by older white men."""
24152	19	For Americans, this meme needs no explanation, because everyone is familiar with the Roe v. Wade case, a lawsuit that began in 1969 and received a historic decision in 1973, which formed the basis of the right to abortion.
24152	21	Jane Rowe is the pseudonym of 21-year-old American Norma McCorvey, who in the late 1960s wanted to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, but was unable to do so because it was against the law. She tried to prove that she got pregnant as a result of rape (then abortion would have been allowed), but she failed. It did not work and illegally to have an abortion: the doctor was arrested a few hours before the operation.
24152	23	Under the pseudonym Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey filed an application in Texas District Court, the defendant was Attorney Henry Wade. The case received such a wide response that it reached the Supreme Court, which in 1973 ruled that the girl had the right to an abortion. Since then, all American women have gained the right to independently control the fate of the fetus - but only up to 7 months, since from that time the fetus was already considered a person, since it could survive without a mother, and an abortion would be murder.
24152	25	No uterus - no opinion
24152	27	"As a result, thousands of American women, outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court, took to the streets with bright slogans: ""Get off my body with your Bible"", ""Regulate weapons, not my ovaries"", ""Stop the war against women"", ""Do not ban abortion - enter mandatory vasectomy."
24152	29	"The Washington Post writes that the issue of abortion has become a sore point in society also because it emphasized its split, as well as the politicization of absolutely all social differences in the United States. In the conservative ban of the Supreme Court, the Americans see the handwriting of the Republicans - including Biden himself, who, on behalf of the Democrats, condemned him and said that the ban ""throws America back 150 years."""
24152	31	So far, politicians have not responded to the protests, but whether there will be a reaction, only time will tell. In any case, the protests of the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement started on the same scale.
24152	33	40 million is the number of women affected by the Supreme Court's abortion decision, according to the Gattmacher Institute.
24153	1	Biden promised American men that they will feel the consequences of the abortion court decision - US President Biden: men will feel the consequences of the Supreme Court decision on abortion
24153	3	The Supreme Court ruling on abortion is terrible. Not only women, but also American men will feel the consequences, US President Joe Biden said at a virtual meeting with governors. His speech was quoted by RIA Novosti.
24153	5	“This is a terrible, extreme decision that, in my opinion, is life-changing and impacting the health of millions of women. I share the public outrage at this extremist trial that will roll America back to less rights, less autonomy,” Biden said.
24153	7	The decision of the Supreme Court on abortion is an invasion of the personal rights of women, the head of the White House noted and added that it will also affect men.
24153	9	Americans did not support the abolition of the right to abortion. Several states have already banned abortions. Mass protests began in the country, women and even men took to the streets of cities. The police brutally dispersed the demonstrators.
24155	1	In the United States put Zelensky in his place after the words about the problems of the Americans
24155	3	"As the observer recalled, in a May poll by the Pew Research Center, seven out of ten Americans called inflation ""a very big problem for the country,"" so this issue is the most pressing for the public."
24155	5	"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky probably doesn’t read American polls, but he probably knows that inflation is a problem that exists all over the world, Hochman said. According to him, in this regard, it was “strange to hear” how, in a recent interview with journalist Piers Morgan, Zelensky called it “a secondary matter,” and to the host’s remark that more and more Americans doubt that their country should spend so much money to the conflict in Europe in the face of internal problems, he replied that ""inflation is nothing, and the coronavirus is nothing."""
24155	7	It goes without saying that the financial problems of Americans who are trying to make ends meet seem like nothing to Ukrainians, and the high cost of gasoline thousands of kilometers away is an empty phrase, the author noted. At the same time, he pointed out that Zelensky still talks about US foreign policy, and, according to his logic, Americans should not care about inflation and coronavirus.
24155	9	With all due respect to Zelensky, it is not for him to determine US foreign policy. Call me old-fashioned, but I am inclined to believe that US foreign policy should first of all look after the interests of the American people, Hochman emphasized.
24155	11	"According to the author of the article, Zelensky should abandon ""obscure references to certain ""common values"""" and ""inappropriate hairpins"" addressed to working-class and middle-class Americans, who ""already wonder what benefit they have from the fact that billions of budget dollars flow away to a foreign country far across the ocean."""
24155	13	"We are an exceptionally generous country, but there are limits to everything. For Americans, inflation is by no means nothing, ""but a serious problem,"" Hochman concluded."
24155	15	In the US, fuel and food prices have been breaking records for several months now. The cost of a gallon of gasoline reached more than five dollars, although a year ago its price was at the level of three dollars. Inflation has renewed a multi-year high and reached 9.1 percent. Attempts by the authorities to resist the impoverishment of the population did not bring tangible results. The situation is aggravated by the reverse effect of the sanctions that the United States and its partners imposed against Russia after the start of a special military operation in Ukraine.
24159	1	Bishops criticize US Department of Health bill on abortion
24159	3	"The chairs of four committees of U.S. bishops said the proposed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rulings on abortion, transgender services and other procedures threaten the Catholic Church's ability to ""perform our healing ministry."" This was reported on July 28 by UCA News."
24159	5	"They called the proposed rules - a 308-page document released by the Ministry of Health on July 25 - ""a violation of religious freedom and a bad remedy."""
24159	7	“They oblige medical professionals to perform life-saving operations to remove perfectly healthy parts of the body,” the bishops said. “Assurances that the Ministry of Health will abide by religious freedom laws are of little comfort as the agency is actively fighting court decisions alleging that the Department of Health violated religious freedom laws the last time they tried to impose such a mandate.”
24159	9	“The proposed rules announce that the Ministry of Health is also considering whether to force medical workers to perform abortions against their will or fire them. We call on the Ministry of Health to expressly renounce any such intentions,” the bishops added.
24159	11	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released a joint statement signed by church hierarchs:
24159	13	Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Laurie, Chairman of the Committee on Action for Life,
24159	15	Chairman of the Committee on Internal Justice and Human Development, Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City,
24159	17	Chairman of the Committee on Laity Affairs, Marriage, Family Life and Youth Archbishop of San Francisco Salvatore J. Cordileone,
24159	19	Chairman of the Religious Freedom Committee, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York.
24159	21	“Catholic health ministries serve everyone, regardless of their race, gender, belief system, or any other characteristics,” the bishops continued. “The same excellent care will be provided in the Catholic hospital to all patients, including patients who identify as transgender, whether it be a broken bone or cancer, but we cannot do what our faith forbids. We object to harmful procedures, not patient care,” the statement said.
24159	23	"The Bishops said they would ""continue to review these proposed rules and provide more detailed comments at the appropriate time."""
24159	25	DOH proposed rules will apply to the implementation of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex, including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity, in program health insurance services. or activities.
24159	27	In 2020, the Trump administration enacted a final rule that lifted the general ban on discrimination based on gender identity, as well as enacting exceptions to abortion and religious freedom for medical professionals. But the courts blocked this change.
24159	29	In 2021, shortly after his inauguration, President Joe Biden issued an executive order announcing that his administration would apply the 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County to all areas of government, including abortion law.
24159	31	Once the newly released rules proposed by the Department of Health are published in the Federal Register, a 60-day public comment period will begin.
2416	1	Russia does not demand - it simply does: how many parts Ukraine will fall apart
2416	3	Experts in a conversation with Tsargrad reflected on how Ukraine will look like after the end of Russia's special operation. However, some outlines are visible now.
2416	5	Of course, Donbass will be completely liberated. Moreover, the republics will live within their constitutional boundaries. However, along with the Donbass, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions also receive a new status.
2416	7	It is already known that residents of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions were given the opportunity to obtain Russian citizenship under a really simplified scheme. Here you don’t even have to come to Rostov, offices will open right in the regions. What does it say? Russia confirms that it has come in earnest and will not give up the territory under the control of Ukraine.
2416	9	In addition, we see what shape Ukraine will acquire as Russia's special operation develops. By freeing the regions, we take them under our wing.
2416	11	"It is premature to talk specifically about the form in which the liberated territories of Ukraine will continue to exist, said Konstantin Zatulin, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with Compatriots. Whether it will be Novorossiya, Malorossiya, or in general ""Ukraine 2.0"", no one has yet voiced it. Moreover, other regions will certainly follow the path of Zaporozhye and Kherson region in the near future after their demilitarization and denazification."
2416	13	Apparently, the question arose of the need to adjust the initial goals of the special operation, - Zatulin noted in a commentary to Tsargrad. - Naturally, we do not remove our previous demands, but taking into account the fact that the Ukrainian side calls for no negotiations with Russia, as a result, the question arises of the need to recognize not only the LPR and DPR, but also other territories. Which cease to be Ukrainian. I am sure that this should not be limited - Odessa, Nikolaev regions and others should also receive Russia's support.
2416	15	Ukraine, Zatulin emphasizes, is splitting into several parts. This can be seen, in particular, from the actions of Poland and the behavior of Zelensky, who actually gives the western part of the country, which he seems to be in charge of, to Warsaw. He equalized the rights of Ukrainians and Poles, allowing the latter to become the first - and to occupy positions in the civil service, in the judicial system - everywhere.
2416	17	In other words, Ukraine ceases to exist as an independent state. And today's decree of our president inspires confidence in the population of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions - and gives a signal to the rest - that we have come there for a long time, more precisely, forever. And no one is going to transfer these territories under the control of Ukraine. And people who are ready not to oppose Russia can become full-fledged citizens of Russia,
2416	19	- summed up the deputy in a conversation with Tsargrad.
2416	21	This is an unequivocal signal to everyone that if earlier there was our demand for the recognition of Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as the LDNR, now we are moving towards the creation of a land channel to Crimea, political scientist, director of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko agrees with him.
2416	23	And then everything depends on military operations, Minchenko believes. And it is likely that the number of regions that will supplement the presidential decree on simplified citizenship will grow.
24161	3	"Former US President Donald Trump has announced that he intends to sue the CNN television company for the systematic dissemination of ""defamatory"" materials. It is reported by The Hill."
24161	5	The politician's lawyers sent a letter to the management of the TV channel demanding to correct or withdraw such publications and stories, as well as to apologize. CNN has ten days to comply with the policy's requirements. After that, the defenders promised that they would seek damages in court.
24161	7	"""I also intend to take legal action against other media outlets that have defamed me and misled the public about compelling evidence of fraud in the 2020 election,"" Trump said."
24161	9	In April 2021, CNN CTO Charlie Chester was accused of using the publication to promote Joe Biden's campaign to the detriment of then-President Donald Trump. Chester also acknowledged that the broadcaster has a predetermined agenda for the future of climate change and the spread of COVID-19.
24163	1	Will Moscow send cavalry to the autumn assault on Kyiv?
24163	3	Scrap metal of the Ministry of Aggression of Russia is running out. Medieval methods of war did not justify themselves. But the Kremlin still craves Kyiv.
24163	5	The Russians still naively believe that without captured German engineers they can modernize their weapons.
24163	7	So a long-term plan for the development of armored weapons and equipment until 2020 provided for extensive unification, new platforms, digital boards, with the possibility of integrating ESU and ACS, but ....
24163	9	Due to the total theft, was completely failed!
24163	11	The new plan until 2027 in terms of nomenclature provided for the modernization of equipment on Soviet platforms. True, this plan was drawn up before the war and before the sanctions, then due to the complete absence of imported kits, it has already been covered with a copper basin.
24163	13	However, no modern reconnaissance and target designation systems, military logistics systems will help scrap metal find a new life.
24163	15	But who was scared when?
24163	17	Having launched even more videos from the Department of Mass Communications, the Ministry of Aggression calmed down the Kremlin senile.
24163	19	All this is fine, but a cartoon army in the second quarter of the 21st century will not fight a fucking thing.
24163	21	And then the question is - does the Putin Administration need it?
24163	23	Or maybe you need to?
24163	25	Maybe Putin puts on manpower?
24163	27	The quality of the officers being trained and the enlisted contract rank and file does not allow the RF Armed Forces to master any modern methods of warfare at all - neither full-fledged with new platforms, nor cut down with old Soviet ones.
24163	29	Which does not prevent at all from sending all the soldiers to slaughter.
24163	31	And to make the picture more juicy, it will be possible to add cavalry units to the hordes of infantry and move this whole coven to Kyiv!
24164	3	The West has allocated $11 billion to help Ukraine, which is less than payments for Russian energy resources, writes Foreign Policy magazine.
24164	4	The publication cited the calculations of the Kiel Institute of World Economy, according to which Western partners have promised Kyiv 31 billion dollars. But, despite the increase in financial support in late June - early July, the Ukrainian budget received only a third of the promised amount.
24164	5	To date, the total amount of assistance provided is about $11 billion, which is still an order of magnitude less than the amount that Russia received for its hydrocarbons over the same period, the article says.
24164	7	Against the backdrop of a Russian military special operation, Western countries continue to pump weapons into Ukraine. For example, in July, Washington announced another $820 million military aid package that includes additional ammunition for the HIMARS MLRS, two Norwegian NASAMS air defense systems, up to 150,000 150mm artillery shells, and four counter-battery radars.
24164	9	Moscow, in turn, has repeatedly stated that the supply of weapons only prolongs the conflict, and the transport of weapons becomes a legitimate target for the Russian Aerospace Forces. As the press secretary of the President Dmitry Peskov emphasized, the actions of the West are not conducive to the success of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations and will have a negative effect.
24165	1	In the Zaporozhye region, they said that the region is leaving Ukraine forever
24165	3	SIMFEROPOL, August 8 - RIA Novosti. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region, said that the region was forever leaving Ukraine, and called on the Kyiv authorities to identify the region exclusively with Russia.
24165	4	Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in his latest video message published on his Telegram channel, said that holding referendums in the southern regions liberated by the Russian Armed Forces would close any possibility for Russia of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world.
24165	5	Zaporizhzhya land forever leaves the structure of Ukraine. The Zaporozhye region has set a course for reunification with Russia and there will be no turning back. Therefore, I advise the Zelensky regime to get used to it now and begin to perceive and identify the Zaporozhye region exclusively with Russia, Rogov told RIA Novosti.
24165	7	According to him, Kyiv knows the mood of people in the liberated territories and their desire to return to Russia, so they are hysterical and trying to threaten the civilian population by shelling civilian infrastructure.
24165	9	No matter how raging the Kyiv authorities and their Western curators may be, they will have to get used to the idea that the inhabitants of the Zaporozhye region will not change their choice, Rogov said.
24165	11	During the special operation, the Russian military took control of the Kherson region and the Azov part of the Zaporozhye region. New administrations have been formed in both regions, Russian TV channels and radio stations are broadcasting, and trade ties with Crimea are being restored. The regions announced plans to become part of Russia.
24167	1	The US is looking for a replacement for Zelensky
24167	2	Columnist Victoria Nikiforova writes that the US is looking for a replacement for Zelensky
24167	4	More recently, the head of the Kyiv regime in his khaki T-shirt was a global icon that the progressive media planted around the world like potatoes. He was even called the second Churchill - this comparison with the drunken alcoholic who launched the collapse of the British Empire is given only to the most distinguished representatives of the colonial elites in a first come first served basis.
24167	5	And suddenly it cut off. Zelensky began to be scolded and scolded by those who loved him so recently: American congressmen, journalists, even human rights activists. It suddenly turned out that in Ukraine everything is somehow not so.
24167	6	"The left-wing elites remembered the Azov*. Yes, they say, there are such fascist bandits in Ukraine, next to whom the Austrian artist is just a baby. American and European Natsiks are going to them today to gain experience. It's good if the Russians denazify them all there. What if someone gets saved? He will return and arrange such a genocide at home that Anders Breivik will become jealous. ""Maybe it's not worth it to roam the Ukrainian Nazis like that,"" left-wing intellectuals timidly asked themselves."
24167	8	"The head of the IAEA deigned to notice that the Ukrainian troops fired on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, and expressed ""concern"" about this. Well, thanks for that anyway. Previously, he preferred point-blank not to see how the ukrovoyaks are trying here and there to provoke monstrous disasters."
24167	10	The legendary Amnesty International suddenly reminded of itself. In their sensational report, human rights activists noted that by placing military equipment in residential buildings, schools and hospitals, Ukraine violates international law.
24167	11	"Even before that, Western human rights activists zealously pecked at Zelensky for violating the rights of such a minority as ""civilian men of Ukraine."" Yes, it's a funny wording, but still. The fact is that a month ago, the head of the General Staff of Ukraine, General Valery Zaluzhny, issued an order prohibiting reservists from leaving their place of residence."
24167	12	Naturally, at the same moment Ukrainians fled en masse abroad. But here's the problem. The border guards let women and children through and rounded up the men. Neither hastily crafted certificates with seals, nor indications of their purely peaceful identity, nor attempts to mow down minorities helped.
24167	14	Genuine tragedies played out on the western border of Ukraine. The men suffered. The influential publication Foreign Policy published the sad story of one such refugee who tried to cross the Polish border with his American husband. My husband was allowed to leave, but he was not. “They didn’t look at the fact that I was gay,” a peace-loving Ukrainian complained to human rights activists. “They looked at whether I had a penis.”
24167	15	This and similar stories were incriminated to Zelensky as a violation of the rights of civilian Ukrainian men. He caught the signal and immediately canceled Zaluzhny's order, but then a new misfortune happened.
24167	16	This time, Zelensky flew in from his compatriot Victoria Kulgeiko (married Spartz). Interestingly, her career has developed almost better than that of Zelensky himself.
24167	17	Kulgeiko was born in 1978 in Nosovka, Ukraine. Pioneer, excellent student, graduated from school with a gold medal. Once, on a train from Kyiv to Moscow, she met an American. She married him in 2000 and became an American citizen in 2006. She made an excellent political career and ended up in the US Congress from the Republicans in 2020. That's good, right?
24167	19	"Today, Kulgeiko-Spartz opens the eyes of fellow congressmen to the fact that Kyiv is stealing their money and reselling almost all of the supplied weapons to the left. She demands that Zelensky stop ""playing politics and theater"" and start fighting for real. And then, look, Ukrainians are sitting in cafes - no, no, urgently to the front, general mobilization!"
24167	20	"Inside the United States, Spartz is raising the topic ""we won't let Ukraine turn into a second Afghanistan."" Republicans PR it from all irons. Democrats criticize but also cite profusely."
24167	21	It is not strange that American money is being stolen in Kyiv and Western weapons are being resold. It is strange that the Americans are talking about this, but how loudly. In Afghanistan, such a drank went not only for years, but for decades, and no one cared. The leaders of Afghanistan were replaced one by one, and no one prevented them from taking a small share from the cuts and kickbacks. Zelensky was much less fortunate.
24167	22	I’m not at all sure that the President of Ukraine is what the Western media portray him to be,” Sky News anchor Corey Bernardi said just now. — The Western media hush up all the horrors that are happening under Zelensky with ethnic Russians in Ukraine… He promised to end the civil war in Ukraine, but he clearly failed. Amazing, isn't it? Have they finally matured?
24167	24	No, it is pointless to hope for some kind of high morality of the American partners. The global regional committee simply began looking for a replacement for Zelensky. The artist clearly does not cope. Today, his place in the progressive media has been taken by the same General Zaluzhny, with whom Zelensky already had counters.
24167	25	"Icon of the Ukrainian resistance, ""legend"", ""iron general"" - in this style they write today in the West about Valery Zaluzhny, the head of the Ukrainian General Staff. A photo shoot with the general was just done by Ukrainian Vogue. ""Ukrainian children use his name in their games,"" reports the Straights Times about him, and I'm even afraid to think what the journalists have in mind. In general, in the West he is positioned as a new hope for Ukraine. Now he will win the Russians, don’t go to the grandmother."
24167	26	This is how Western experts who once loved Zelensky are ironic about his jealousy of Zaluzhny. But the thing here is not only the jealousy of a slender intellectual to a tall, pumped-up military uncle. Everything is much worse.
24167	27	It's no secret that Zelensky has always been disliked by local nationalists. But over the past few months, he has developed a lot of haters inside the Ukrainian army. It is not difficult to imagine how Zaluzhny felt when Zelensky canceled his order, and even issued a public reprimand.
24167	29	"By the way, returning to Churchill. Exactly sixty years ago, the colonial administration of South Vietnam was headed by a protege of the Americans - a local boy from a good family, Ngo Dinh Diem. He was a very intelligent man, joking aside. He was the first third world politician whom the Americans elevated to the rank of ""new Churchill"". It was said by Democratic Vice President Lyndon Johnson, the comparison was liked by everyone, it was reprinted in all the newspapers."
24167	30	The United States pumped up South Vietnam with weapons and forced them to fight North Vietnam. However, the South Vietnamese military did not like Ngo Dinh Diem. Most of all, he was disliked by Duong Van Min (Big Min), a tall and beefy general who believed that the president was corrupt and deliberately leaked military operations.
24167	31	By 1963, the New Churchill was noticeably fed up with its American masters. Until now, historians are arguing whether the CIA participated in a conspiracy against him or not, but two points are crystal clear: the American intelligence services learned about the military conspiracy against Ngo Dinh Diem and removed their guards from him. The coup was led by General Duong Van Minh. On November 2, 1963, New Churchill was kidnapped, taken to the basement, and shot in the temple. Nobody really took pity on him. Lyndon Johnson was not up to it: just twenty days later, Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas, and Johnson became president of the United States.
24167	32	"It is interesting that Big Min passed through all the ups and downs of the Vietnam War unharmed. In 1975 (after the flight of the next president), he announced the surrender of South Vietnam and surrendered his affairs to the North Vietnamese comrades, after which he was released to all sides and lived quietly in his villa, where he bred birds and orchids. He died of natural causes at the age of 85. In the 1990s, the Vietnamese leadership even discussed whether to award him the title of ""Hero of Vietnam""."
24168	2	Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Medvedev said that the Russian Federation will seek peace with Ukraine on its own terms
24168	4	"Russia is conducting a special operation in Ukraine and is seeking peace on its own terms, and not on those that are trying to be imposed by the ex-""partners"" in the international community, who are longing for the military defeat of the country. Deputy head of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev spoke about this, TASS writes."
24168	6	According to the politician, the conduct of a special military operation was a harsh but well-thought-out response to the Russophobic policy of Western countries. “We have our own national interests, and we will ensure them by all available means,” Medvedev stressed.
24168	8	Earlier, the deputy chairman of the Security Council said that the future of Ukraine is very different from how it is seen in Kyiv. As an illustration of his thesis, the politician attached to the post two pictures showing maps of Ukraine - according to Kyiv and according to the West.
24168	10	Medvedev also stated that Ukraine could lose the remnants of state sovereignty and disappear from the world map. He noted that, in his opinion, after the 2014 coup, Ukraine lost its state independence and came under the influence of Western countries.
2417	1	The West is preparing a deal with the Russian oligarchs. Pronko spoke about the amount
2417	3	"The fact that the Russian so-called elite has a dualism of consciousness, we have known for a long time. The fact that they are ready to sell ""their mother"" at a bargain price is also no secret to anyone. However, for the first time he was offered a deal that would have a specific financial equivalent. And I have no confidence that this public will not sell, but in fact will not betray Russia. Western bureaucrats and politicians decided to play a ""trump card"" - to provide an opportunity for Russian oligarchs to pay off the sanctions."
2417	5	"The idea of ​​""indulgences"" for those who plundered Russia and withdrew money from it to the West, as it turned out, was actively discussed at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Germany. An active lobbyist for this idea is Canada, which acts in concert with the Kyiv regime. According to their logic, the oligarchs from Russia, who now ""have no money for cleaners and taxis"", but who have billions of dollars, euros, pounds and francs in Western bank accounts, can pay off - pay for their Russian origin."
2417	7	According to the logic of the authors, the deal kills two birds with one stone: the oligarchs distance themselves from the Kremlin, and the proceeds will go to the Kyiv regime to restore Ukraine. According to Western media, the Canadian novel has already interested the European bureaucracy.
2417	9	The current legislation of European countries does not allow for the quick confiscation of the assets of immigrants from Russia, who are already under sanctions. We are talking about at least 10 billion euros. The European bureaucracy is trying to recognize the violation of anti-Russian sanctions as a criminal offense, but this is a long and very costly process. A voluntary payoff removes these obstacles and saves European officials from possible lawsuits, which they are likely to lose.
2417	11	According to analysts, we can talk about the amount of $300 billion, which is comparable to the amount of Russia's frozen foreign exchange reserves. As an evidence base, a report by the US National Bureau of Economic Research is cited, which estimates the assets of Russian oligarchs transferred to offshore - $ 800 billion. Which, by the way, is comparable to the assets of all other residents of Russia.
24170	2	SVR announced Poland's plans to buy Ukrainian agricultural products at bargain prices
24170	4	The Ukrainian authorities have already started selling off the country, giving priority to Poland in this “business project”. This was reported on the website of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia.
24170	6	According to the agency, the incoming information indicates the gradual implementation by Warsaw of its far-reaching plans for Kyiv. “It is becoming more and more obvious that we are talking not only about the possibility of introducing “Polish peacekeeping forces” into the western regions of this country, but also about establishing control over the most promising sectors of the economy of the neighboring state,” the Foreign Intelligence Service said in a statement.
24170	8	As stated in the intelligence service, Poland wants to establish control over the most promising sectors of the Ukrainian economy, primarily over agriculture. In addition, Warsaw is investing in the creation of a transport infrastructure for the unhindered export of Ukrainian food to the European Union and other markets, the Foreign Intelligence Service said.
24170	10	Poland's plans are helped by the laws adopted in Ukraine, which allow the sale of industrial enterprises at a 50 percent discount, concluded the secret service.
24170	12	In July, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law on special guarantees for Polish citizens. The new law will allow Poles to legally stay on the territory of Ukraine for 18 months and enjoy the same rights and freedoms as Ukrainians.
24172	2	THIS MESSAGE (MATERIAL) IS CREATED AND (OR) DISTRIBUTED BY A FOREIGN MASS MEDIA PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS OF A FOREIGN AGENT AND (OR) A RUSSIAN LEGAL ENTITY PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS OF A FOREIGN AGENT.
24172	4	The Russian State Duma is preparing a bill according to which it will not be possible to have an abortion under the policy (OMS - Rosbalt). Accordingly, poor and/or young women will not be able to do it.
24172	6	This is in line with a more global trend - the terrible abortion law in Poland, the restriction on abortion in a number of states in the United States. The logic of the state is clear here: we need more bodies that can pay taxes, especially in a situation where the birth rate is declining. And it is decreasing in general due to the second demographic transition: women (most often educated) give birth to few children and late.
24172	8	But such prohibitions have far-reaching consequences. In 2001, the famous work of economists John Donoghue and Stephen Levitt, The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime, was published. This study almost lynched the authors, and it showed an important connection: the prohibition of abortion is directly related to the increase in juvenile delinquency in increments of 15-18 years.
24172	10	The authors studied the rise and fall of crime in various US states that allow and prohibit abortion over a period of 30 years. The conclusion is very simple: the legalization of abortion is responsible for reducing crime by 50%. Why? Women often go for an abortion when they have nothing to feed their child or they live in a very socially disadvantaged world. If they give birth to children, especially against their will, these children are then more likely to end up in orphanages or on the streets, leading to an explosion of juvenile delinquency when they grow up.
24173	2	Foreign Minister Liz Truss promised to defeat Russia in the chair of British Prime Minister
24173	4	British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, whose name is associated with a number of high-profile scandals, made a number of promises to voters after announcing her intention to compete for the seat of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. To do this, she wrote a column in The Telegraph newspaper.
24173	6	"Truss paid a lot of attention to relations with Russia: on the one hand, she called Moscow one of the main modern threats to London along with Beijing, on the other hand, she promised to ""ensure Ukraine's victory in the war."" In addition, the minister promised to “immediately get down to business” in her post and start rebuilding the country’s economy, which has suffered from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reverse effect of anti-Russian sanctions. Finally, an important point in Truss' ""program"" was a promise to cut taxes."
24174	3	The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), according to the preliminary version, purposefully fired at a brewery in Donetsk, the DPR representative office at the Joint Center for Control and Coordination (JCCC) of the ceasefire regime said.
24174	5	“Presumably, they hit with 152 mm shells, they will put out the fire, fix it, there will be more accurate data. Judging by how it happened, according to the preliminary version, they were targeted [at the brewery],” a source told TASS.
24174	7	According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the DPR, during the shelling of the brewery in Donetsk, 32 people were on its territory, previously, one was killed, two were injured. The area of ​​the fire that broke out after the shelling is 600 square meters. meters.
24174	9	"Earlier it was reported that the armed forces of Ukraine fired at the Donetsk brewery, resulting in an ammonia leak. The Ministry of Emergency Situations of the DPR asks residents to ""take measures to additionally seal their apartments (houses), premises."" The department indicated that it was necessary to “breathe through cotton-gauze bandages moistened with a five percent solution of citric or acetic acid.”"
24175	1	KISSINGER: US IS ON THE VERGE OF WAR WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA
24175	3	The US is on the brink of war with Moscow and Beijing over issues that they have partly created themselves. This was stated by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
24175	5	We are on the verge of war with Russia and China on issues that we have partly created without any idea of ​​how it will end or where it should lead, he said.
24175	7	"Kissinger noted that the only way out is not to add fuel to the fire and at the same time create options for resolving disagreements, but for this there must be some purpose. Speaking about Ukraine, the former US Secretary of State noted that earlier the role of a NATO member was more suitable for Finland. Now, because of the special operation being carried out by the Russian Federation, he ""believes that one way or another (officially or not) Ukraine should now be treated as a member of NATO."""
24175	9	The settlement of the Ukrainian conflict itself will eventually keep Crimea and parts of the Donbass for Russia, writes the author of the publication, referring to the opinion of Kissinger.
24177	2	Philosopher Alexander Dugin called the death of his daughter Daria in a car explosion on Mozhaisk highway a terrorist attack
24177	4	Philosopher Alexander Dugin called the death of his daughter Daria in a car explosion on Mozhaisk highway a terrorist attack. Dugin's statement was published on his Telegram channel by businessman Konstantin Malafeev.
24177	6	"Dugin wrote that the ""Nazi Ukrainian regime"" carried out the incident. According to him, Daria Dugina never called for violence and war, writes NSN."
24177	8	“She was a rising star at the beginning of her journey. Enemies of Russia meanly, surreptitiously killed her. But we, our people, cannot be broken even by such unbearable blows. They wanted to crush our will with bloody terror against the best and most vulnerable of us. But they won't get it. Our hearts yearn for more than just revenge or retribution. It's too small, not in Russian. We only need our Victory. My daughter laid her maiden life on her altar. So win, please! We wanted to raise her to be smart and a hero. Even now, she inspires the sons of our Fatherland to a feat, ”Dugin emphasized.
24177	10	Filosov added that a civil memorial service for his daughter will begin at 10:00 on August 23 at the Ostankino television center in Moscow.
24178	2	"Philosopher Dugin said that his daughter Daria ""died for Russia and in the name of victory"""
24178	4	"Philosopher and political scientist Alexander Dugin during the farewell ceremony said that his daughter Daria ""died for Russia and in the name of victory"" and spoke about the main desire that she had during her lifetime. He is quoted by RBC."
24178	6	“She would have one desire: do not remember me, do not glorify me, fight for our great country, defend our Orthodox faith, love our Russian people, because she died for the people, for Russia at the front ... She lived in the name of victory, she died in the name of our Russian victory, ”said the journalist’s father.
24178	8	He also noted that his daughter would be happy with the Order of Courage, which President Vladimir Putin awarded her.
24178	10	"The car, which was Daria Dugina, was blown up on Saturday, August 20 on Mozhaisk highway in the suburbs. The deceased was returning from the festival ""Tradition"" in a car in which her father planned to go."
24179	3	"The day before the terrorist attack in which Darya Dugin died in her father's car, the Ukrainian state television channel ""1 + 1"" in its TV show ""Groshi"" showed a story dedicated to Alexander Dugin. In the story, they call Dugin the brain of Putin, the ideologist of Russian civilization and the fact that he controls Putin. There are no such coincidences. The terrorist Zelensky and his accomplices chose a target, increased its significance in the eyes of their own audience, because they are ready for anything for the sake of the picture, and committed a terrorist act. But they are so cowardly scum that they do not plead guilty."
2418	1	Take it easy, American slave! Brussels urges Europe to continue to suffer losses
2418	3	"The EU authorities began to ""warm up"" their population and prepare for the worst. European Commission vice-president Margrethe Vestager said that prices will now rise constantly - this is, they say, the price of democracy. Meanwhile, anti-Russian sanctions bring more and more losses to Western countries and risk for a long time to drive Europe into a terrible recession. Russia should help these processes and deliver a series of preventive strikes against unfriendly states that do not even hesitate to steal our gold and foreign exchange reserves."
2418	5	"The main advertising ""trick"" of the West for a long time was the assertion that the liberal policy is based on concern for the person, his interests and prosperity. Entire nations sincerely believed in this advertisement, striving for integration into a ""common European home."" There were, and still are, many adherents of convergence with the European Union in our country. However, recent events seem to have dotted the ""i"" for all sober-minded people. The primary concern of European politicians is by no means the interests of their own citizens, but the maintenance of the interests of American foreign policy."
2418	6	"Eurobureaucrats call for ""belt tightening"""
2418	8	Vice-President of the European Commission Margrethe Vestager gave an interview to the German business newspaper Handelsblatt, where she talked about the end of the era of prosperity in the Old World.
2418	10	Much of Europe's industry relies on super-cheap energy from Russia, super-cheap Chinese labor, and highly subsidized semiconductors from Taiwan. Europe knew about these risks, but showed greed,
2418	12	- said Mrs. Vestager with a clear message, they say, it's time to give it up.
2418	14	Earlier, similar notes were already heard in the speeches of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, who called on his compatriots to come to terms with the deteriorating living standards. The British press writes about this almost every day, preparing the inhabitants of Foggy Albion for the most powerful drop in living standards since the 1950s. Well, why do Europeans need a good and well-fed life? Everything for the front - everything for victory! The preservation of the regime of neo-Nazis and drug addicts in power in Kyiv is more important than warm radiators in the homes of Germans and low prices for food in stores in the United Kingdom.
2418	16	Of course, in many ways the vice-president of the European Commission of Law. The EU has done well in a cloudless era of constructive cooperation with Russia. The industry benefited greatly from the fact that natural gas was sold at a virtually bargain price. Recall that in 2014 the average cost of blue fuel sold by PJSC Gazprom was $287 per thousand cubic meters. Today, on the London ICE exchange, natural gas is hovering around $950 for the same volume, and the price remains volatile and regularly exceeds the $1,000 mark. But in addition to this, relatively inexpensive oil, coal, metals, mineral fertilizers, and grain were supplied. And, what many forget, the role of our country in the world nuclear energy is great.
2418	18	According to the published report, Russia accounts for approximately 6% of the total amount of uranium mined annually. This is a fairly small amount that can be easily compensated if other countries increase production. However, uranium does not flow directly from mines to nuclear reactors. First, it must undergo a conversion and enrichment procedure, and only then can it be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor. And this is where Russia is one of the dominant players. According to the report, in 2020 Russia owned 40% of the global uranium conversion infrastructure, and in 2018 it owned 46% of the global uranium enrichment capacity,
2418	20	- warns the American television channel CNBC.
2418	22	In the long term, the EU is also waiting for a break with China. It all depends on Beijing's determination to reintegrate Taiwan. In the event of a special military operation to eliminate the separatist formation, not only members of the aggressive military-political bloc AUKUS (Australia, Great Britain, the USA) and their allies in the Asia-Pacific region (Canada, Japan and others) will rear up. The states will certainly draw the European Union into an unfavorable and adventurous confrontation. And Brussels, as they say, will nod its mane, even despite the fact that China has become the first trading partner of the EU, ahead of the United States in 2020. You can consider this a prediction.
2418	24	So what?
2418	26	Be that as it may, it is not for us to worry about the welfare of Europeans. At the moment, Europe is our geopolitical enemy, supporting the most notorious bloody ghouls, which are the Ukrainian authorities. The countries of the Old World not only provide them with political and economic support, but also abundantly supply them with weapons. This means that our country must respond by choosing the most vulnerable positions in European foreign trade.
24180	2	Greece, Denmark, Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia are blacklisted by the Russian government
24180	4	The Russian government has updated the list of foreign states that commit unfriendly actions against Russian diplomatic and consular missions abroad.
24180	6	According to the press service of the Cabinet of Ministers, the list includes Greece, Denmark, Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia. The list approved by the government, in addition to the names of countries, indicates the number of citizens on the territory of the Russian Federation with whom the diplomatic missions of unfriendly countries and their consular offices can conclude employment contracts. So, according to the new order, Greece has a limit of 34 people, Denmark - 20, Slovakia - 16. Slovenia and Croatia will not be able to hire employees in their diplomatic missions and consular offices.
24180	8	"This order was adopted as part of the implementation of the decree of President Vladimir of April 23 ""On the application of measures of influence (counteraction) to unfriendly actions of foreign states."" The decree involves limiting up to a complete ban for unfriendly countries the ability to hire embassies, consulates and representative offices of state bodies from among persons located on the territory of Russia."
24180	10	"""The list approved by the government is not final and, taking into account the ongoing hostile actions of foreign states directed against Russian missions abroad, it may expand,"" the press service noted."
24181	3	"The head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, expressed confidence that ""terrorists of the Ukrainian regime"" were behind the explosion of the car of the daughter of public figure Alexander Dugin, Darya, in the Moscow region."
24181	5	- Vile scoundrels! The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter. In the car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl! — the head of the region wrote in his Telegram channel.
24181	7	"The explosion of a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado in the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy near Moscow occurred on the night of Sunday, August 21. According to preliminary information, the daughter of the ideologist of the ""Russian world"" Alexander Dugin, Daria, was in the car. The owner of the vehicle, who was driving, died at the scene."
24182	3	The US State Broadcasting and Television Committee has banned channels from showing or mentioning interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian journalists due to significant violations in the ideological sphere.
24182	5	According to Axios, citing its own sources, the official wording is racially motivated - in an interview, four white men ask questions to the fifth. Not only women are not represented, but also other races, as well as minorities.
24182	7	“There are five whites in one frame. If this was brought to me on the editing table, I would answer: are you crazy? This is not the 1940s,” a CNBC staff source said.
24184	3	In connection with the events in Ukraine, the UK has sent an application to the European Commission to join the European Union under an accelerated procedure by the end of 2022.
24184	5	“Today's events require all Europeans to unite in order to survive in this difficult time. The UK really needs the support of the EU to maintain high rates of economic development and fight inflation. More recently, the UK was a member of the EU and fully complied with its standards. Then we were forced to leave, but now we have decided to return to the big European family,” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
24184	7	The European Commission confirmed receipt of the British application and promised to study it carefully.
24184	9	"“It's a long process. All 27 states must examine the UK application and decide whether it satisfies the European requirement. Still, this is, firstly, an island, not continental Europe, and secondly, enough time has passed since Britain left. We need to study all this,"" said the head of the EC, Ursula von der Leyen."
24187	3	In the city of Sosnovoborsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory, a group of pensioners who purchased a solution of clonidine in pharmacies was uncovered. According to investigators, they did this in order to hijack the bomber.
24187	5	The impending crime was discovered by accident. The district inspector went into the pharmacy and heard a 73-year-old woman asking the pharmacist for clonidine in a 0.125% solution. Shortly before this, the officer read a message on the Internet that a group of foreign intelligence officers, led by the Bulgarian journalist Khristo Grozev, intended to hijack a Russian combat aircraft, using clonidine for this.
24187	7	“The drug is added in a small amount to vodka, after which the plane is hijacked. However, thanks to the vigilance of the district police officer, the preparation for the crime was disrupted,” the official press release says.
24187	9	The audit identified 27 buyers of clonidine aged 67 to 89 years. They all claimed that they needed clonidine eye drops to treat glaucoma, but the investigator calculated that the clonidine they bought would be enough to hijack all the equipment of a heavy bomber regiment stationed in the Amur Region. Also, the fact that they're all talking about the same story speaks volumes about collusion.
24188	3	The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, turned to Russia with a demand to compensate for the damage to the EU states caused as a result of visa restrictions for Russians. According to experts, at the end of the year this amount will amount to 35 billion euros.
24188	5	The debt, according to Brussels, must be paid off before January 1, 2023, otherwise its amount will grow, and a penalty interest will be charged for each day overdue.
24188	7	“Statements that it was Europe that introduced visa restrictions are inappropriate. If Russia were a civilized state, we would never take such measures. The countries that have introduced restrictions are understandable,” the EC President is sure.
24188	9	The official stressed that the disconnection of most Russian banks from the SWIFT system would not be considered a mitigating circumstance, because alternative forms of payment are acceptable.
2419	3	"The Kremlin this week was actively spreading the narrative about the ""inevitable victory of Russia"" and the need for Ukraine to make concessions. To do this, the aggressor country uses ""loyal Western experts."""
2419	5	It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the Telegram channel of the Center for Counteracting Disinformation under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine.
2419	7	"For example, the French Center for Intelligence Studies published an analytical summary that partially promotes the Kremlin narratives about ""inexperienced Ukrainian soldiers"" and ""a professional Russian army."""
2419	9	"In addition, ex-US Senator R. Black, in an interview with English-language media, spoke about the inevitable victory of Russia, since ""the Russian Federation cannot afford to lose because of the threat of NATO expansion."""
2419	11	"Also, Italian General L. Tricarico called on the EU to abandon the ""crazy idea of ​​winning the war in Ukraine"" and persuade Ukraine to capitulate so as not to provoke Russia to use weapons of mass destruction"
2419	13	"At the same time, the German Schiller Institute held an international discussion on the threat of World War III, the participants of the event came to the conclusion that ""a confrontation with Russia is disastrous for Germany and the EU."""
2419	15	As explained in the National Security and Defense Council, all these statements are an attempt by Russia to impose on the world the point of view necessary for the Russian Federation. Recall that President Volodymyr Zelensky said that some geopoliticians offer Ukraine to make concessions to Russia and give up territories for the sake of the illusion of peace.
24190	3	On August 30, an online referendum will be held in Russia on the launch of the Nord Stream gas pipeline after the completion of scheduled repairs. If the Russians speak out against it, gas supplies to Europe will not be resumed.
24190	5	Alexei Miller, General Director of PJSC Gazprom, explained that the gas concern is a national asset, and therefore the issue of export should be decided by the Russian people. Miller recalled that the results of the referendum have a higher priority than the international agreement on the supply of blue fuel to the EU countries - this directly follows from the amendments to the Constitution.
24190	7	You can vote on the State Services website or in person, for which you need to come on August 30 to the Gazprom office at the place of registration. You must have a passport and a certificate of no debt for gas with you.
24191	3	More and more countries are trying to distance themselves from the aggressive policies of the United States and Great Britain, which could cause the outbreak of the Third World War. On August 11, 2022, it became known that the Liechtenstein government decided to leave NATO and officially declare its neutrality.
24191	5	“We are a small European country, the militaristic aspirations of Washington and London are alien to us. Liechtenstein has never had any contradictions with Russia and China, if the Americans want to make a big war - this is their right, but we will not participate in this, ”said Prime Minister Daniel Risch.
24191	7	According to experts, Liechtenstein may become the first sign of the collapse of NATO - the aggressive policy of the alliance is dissatisfied with an increasing number of Europeans who want a peaceful and peaceful life.
242	3	On the issue of arms supplies to Ukraine, Moscow leaves Germany no choice. This, according to Münchner Merkur, was announced by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the congress of the Association of German Trade Unions.
242	4	“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin leaves us no other choice,” he said.
242	6	The statement of the German Chancellor was discussed in the Telegram messenger.
242	8	“Not Moscow [leaves the FRG no choice], but Washington,” German Chancellor Gerakl corrected.
242	10	"""Isn't it time to close the valve?"" ""A"" asked."
242	12	"It’s high time,” Nataliya answered him.
242 14 “It is high time to stop gas supplies! And oil! And let the grandson of an SS man explain to the citizens of Germany why their prices for goods are rising and it’s cold at home, ”wrote Svetlana.
242 16 “I wish I could ask the Germans who elected him what they want. Even those who were dumbfounded on February 24 have already orientated themselves and understand that the States want to ruin the advanced economy of Europe - the German economy, ”writes Elena S.
242 18 ""Don't the Germans want the Banner of Victory over the Reichstag 2.0?"" Dmitry S asked sarcastically.
242 20 “Which side is Germany on? What is Russia threatening her with? Although it is clear that all the scum of the collective West was waiting for the moment to pounce on Russia. Only stupid Ukraine is in no way able to realize its place and role in this confrontation, ”Galina noted.
242 22 “They lie in warm beds and think they are playing a computer game in which they can roll back. Late. Power is in the truth. But they don’t have it and never had it, ”Alexander reacted.
242 24 “Of course, Russia is “to blame”. Why did she supply them with cheap gas? Now there is no choice, we have made weapons, but we need to put something somewhere (it is necessary. - O.P.),” Evgeny Sh wrote sarcastically.
242 26 “Yes. Merkel was smarter,"" Lyubov added.
242 28 “Basta, it's time to stop trading with the devils. No gas, no oil, no grain - nothing!” called Alimag.
242 30 “Fascist solidarity,” Andriukha reacted.
242 32 “Hasn't Germany wiped itself from Zelensky's spitting yet? Damn, well, how dependent they are ... ”- wrote Olga r.
242 34 “Destroy it economically, so that they don’t produce weapons for Nazi Ukraine,” Serhiy urged.
242 36 “Fascists are fascists even after 77 years…” summed up Denis.
2420 1 Zelensky explained what would happen in the world if Russia wins
2420 3 If Russia is allowed to win the war against Ukraine, the whole world will be in danger. Because all autocrats will understand that they can also make territorial conflicts and destroy peoples.
2420 5 It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the advisor to the head of the Office of the President Mikhail Podolyak on Twitter.
2420 6 Why is the world paying more attention to Ukraine than to Africa and the East?"" - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents of influence. Only Russian barbarians can weigh tragedies on the scales,"" Podolyak wrote."
2420	8	He noted that the war in Ukraine is not a local conflict or a humanitarian crisis, but a question of what the world will be like tomorrow.
2420	10	Allowing Russia to win would open a Pandora's box and send humanity back to the dark ages. Every hypocritical autocrat will be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries, destroy peoples. To stop is a joint mission of civilized countries. There is still time, but time to hurry up, - Podolyak stressed.
2420	12	"Recall that this week the Kremlin was actively spreading the narrative about the ""inevitable victory of Russia"" and the need for Ukraine to make concessions. To do this, the aggressor country used ""loyal Western experts."""
2421	3	In the occupied Genichesk, Kherson region, the invaders are trying to start the tourist season. For greater persuasiveness, machines are used.
2421	5	It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the message of the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova.
2421	7	"Armed Russian servicemen broke into the private recreation centers ""Bely Lebed"" and ""Arabatka.club"" in the village of Genicheskaya Gorka on the Arabat Spit,"" she said."
2421	9	"According to her, the invaders forbade local guards to let people into the bases, threatening that ""in the near future these territories will become Russian property."""
2421	11	At the same time, according to Denisova, the invaders themselves in military uniform post posts on their pages on social networks about how they bask in the sun on the shores of the Sea of ​​Azov.
2422	2	English journalist campaigns for everyone to lower the temperature in their homes
2422	4	British journalist Chris Giles appealed to all concerned Europeans to “freeze for the sake of Ukraine” – in his opinion, lowering the temperature in their homes will help Europe cope with dependence on Russian gas.
2422	6	In order to contribute to the fight against hated Russia, the journalist is sure, it is necessary that the temperature in the apartments does not exceed 18 degrees.
2422	8	- House temperatures in the United Kingdom have risen by five degrees over the past 40 years. We can wear more layers, use blankets and buy efficient battery-heated jackets,” Giles said.
2422	10	According to calculations by the consulting company Cambridge Energy, lowering the temperature in residential premises by only 2 degrees Celsius (from 20 to 18) can save energy by 20-25%.
2422	12	Many Europeans do not agree with such calls: they believe that a competition has been announced in civilized Europe for the most inadequate ways to fight Russia. So, in order to save fuel, citizens are encouraged to drive more slowly, in order to save gas - to swim less often (it turns out that this is even very good for the skin), and also to eat less. In particular, meat, the production of which takes a lot of energy.
2424	3	Not so long ago, Arestovich said, addressing the inhabitants of the territories liberated by Russia, that they were not forgotten by the Kyiv regime.
2424	4	Source: vmiresmi.ru
2424	6	However, even without Arestovich, the inhabitants of these places know that they are remembered in Kyiv. For example, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue shelling the Nikolo-Vasilyevsky Monastery in the already liberated village of Nikolsky, Volnovakha District, DPR. And recently, as Father Feofan, a resident of the monastery, said, Ukrainian artillerymen competed in accuracy, knocking down crosses from the domes of the temple.
2424	8	The monastery suffered a particularly severe blow on April 11, 2022, the day after the Nazi fighters had to retreat from the village. Then, people died under enemy shells, the temple, outbuildings, and the fraternal corps were damaged. Thus, the Ukrainian government regularly tries to remind people who have escaped from under its dictates about themselves.
2424	10	So, on May 22, Bandera from the territory of the Nikolaev region hit the village of Belozerka, Kherson region, with cluster munitions from the Uragan multiple launch rocket system. Two people were killed, including a fourteen-year-old teenager. About ten people were injured of varying severity, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.
2424	12	A blow to an ordinary village, where there are no military and infrastructure facilities, is not an accident, but a trend. The fact is that, knowing the desire of the Nazis to kill as many residents of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions as possible, Russian troops are trying to reliably cover with air defense systems not only military facilities, but primarily cities, as well as critical infrastructure facilities. Therefore, the Bandera people today have redirected to small settlements, where there is less chance that the missiles fired by them will be intercepted.
2424	14	However, the shelling of their former fellow citizens, although they allow them to vent their hatred and desire to kill, is not very advantageous in terms of propaganda. Out of old habit, the Nazis declare that the Russians themselves not only fire at the settlements they have liberated, but also intercept their own rockets above them. However, not only do they not believe such feeds even in Ukraine, the Bandera people themselves in such a scheme are nothing more than extras, which, of course, does not suit them.
2424	16	They consider terrorist attacks to be much more advantageous, which, on the one hand, provide an opportunity to demonstrate their subjectivity, and even in the lost territories, and on the other hand, to attribute everything to “people's avengers”.
2424	18	Thus, representatives of the Nazi regime in Zaporozhye proudly acknowledged the terrorist attack in Energodar, saying that the attempt on the life of the mayor of the city, Andriy Shevchik, was “a pinpoint action by partisans.” Recall that the terrorists set up an IED in the entrance of a residential building where the mayor's mother lived.
2424	20	Meanwhile, today in the territories of the former Ukraine, still controlled by the Nazis, sociologists state that they are tired of the military agenda. And this is a very alarming sign for the regime, since speculation on the military theme allows them to manipulate public consciousness, mask and “justify” their failures and crimes, and even explain their lies as “military necessity”.
2424	22	And now the effectiveness of this universal method is decreasing, and soon it will stop working altogether, since it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract attention with the theme of war. There are no military victories and are not expected, it is not even possible to blind a more or less plausible picture of some kind of “overcome”. About the “ghost of Kyiv” and something like that, it’s better not to even stutter.
2424	24	How to be? Media experts of Zelensky’s office claim that it is the terrorist attacks and reprisals against “collaborators” that are of the greatest interest to the audience. Why not in relation to Russian troops? For the Ukrainian layman, Russians are depersonalized, in addition, Zelensky’s office “killed” so many of them that people stopped believing these figures.
2424	26	"It is a different matter if the victim of terrorists is a former “friend”, who may even be a famous person, a politician or a journalist. You can't lie here anymore. In addition, the murders, according to the ""political technologists"" from the Ze-team who order them, should intimidate the population and keep them from going over to the side of the liberators. Plus an archetype."
2424	28	"Recall that those Bandera people who acted in the 40-50s, first of all, killed their own, often even fellow villagers, teachers, priests, workers of collective farms and local administrations, “hawks” and policemen. In short, the same Ukrainians who wanted to build a peaceful life and therefore were considered ""hot spots""."
2425	3	International business has at the corporate level to recognize as unacceptable cooperation and trade with countries such as Russia, which unleashed a bloody war and is engaged in the murder and terror of civilians according to all the norms of international law.
2425	5	This was reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to DTEK CEO Maxim Timchenko at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum.
2425	7	Every dollar paid to Russia today for gas, for oil, every piece of equipment delivered to Russia is automatically converted into bullets that kill Ukrainians. Can there be a higher price for 137 children's lives that were cut short due to Russian aggression. What justification can there be for these companies that are still cooperating with Russia, Timchenko said.
2425	9	The head of DTEK thanked the companies that had already stopped cooperation with Russia, as well as for the help Ukraine receives from its European partners and for the imposition of sanctions.
2425	11	I am convinced that already now respect for freedom should become part of the corporate policy of Western companies, a ban on cooperation with aggressor countries, such as Russia is today, should be written in corporate values, - Timchenko emphasized.
2426	1	Could monkeypox become a new pandemic?
2426	3	Around the world, the number of cases of monkeypox infection is now rapidly increasing. Six episodes have already been identified in the Netherlands, five people are under suspicion in the United States, 20 confirmed cases in Spain, and the diagnosis is questionable in another 16 patients. Just in this country now they are waiting for a large-scale outbreak of the disease. Is it really a new pandemic, the correspondent of REN TV in Spain found out.
2426	5	Almost the first major European rave party since the coronavirus may be the prologue to a new pandemic. Almost all of those who fell ill with monkeypox last week were participants in a huge disco in the Canary Islands. For a week, it was visited by about 80 thousand people from all over Europe, the USA and some Asian countries.
2426	7	Only now it becomes clear that, along with vivid impressions, a rare and, as it turned out, very contagious virus was taken away from the party.
2426	9	In the center of Spain, the number of cases is approaching fifty, this is the most difficult situation in the world. The authorities have already declared a state of emergency. Now doctors are on duty around the clock, tracking every suspicious case and checking everyone who has recently been to the Canary Islands.
2426	11	The panic has grown so much that many, just in case, put on masks again, which they had just been allowed to take off after severe coronavirus restrictions.
2426	13	Now we can prevent such severe consequences that we faced in the previous pandemic. More or less, we already know how to behave, how to protect ourselves and our loved ones, - said David, a local resident.
2426	15	Until now, all cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have been recorded only in African countries. One of the main centers of the European party is located in the Canary Islands. Ill - in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain. Monkeypox has even reached Argentina. WHO calls for urgent action!
2426	17	We are all very vulnerable now, we are again faced with a situation that is out of control. And we need to create a real, working mechanism as soon as possible to stop the spread of the monkeypox outbreak, said Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh, President of the 75th WHO Assembly.
2426	19	The Europeans were clearly not ready for a quick and joint response. Of all the countries, only one Belgium decided to introduce restrictive measures and prescribed strict quarantine for all sick people after the first three detected cases. Other countries are just monitoring the spread of the disease. But the authorities of Russia quickly reacted, where so far not a single case of monkeypox has been identified.
2426	21	In order to prevent the importation of this disease into Russia, Rospotrebnadzor has strengthened sanitary and quarantine control measures at the border.
2426	23	Our country also has a unique, Soviet, experience in the fight against smallpox. It could well be used against a new variety, experts say. They don't see anything terrible in monkeypox at all.
2426	25	There should be no surprises, unless one of the military microbiologists worked on it, - says the head of the laboratory of especially dangerous infections of the Federal Research Center for Fundamental and Translational Medicine, Professor of Virology Alexander Chepurnov.
2426	27	However, WHO experts urgently studied the history of monkeypox in recent years and identified a very alarming trend.
2426	29	We have followed closely the increasing outbreaks of this disease in Cameroon, CAR, Congo and other countries. There, smallpox became an almost constant disease, it began to spread more often not in a rural environment close to wild animals, but in an urban environment - among people, - said Rosamyn Louis, an expert in rare diseases.
2426	31	That is, according to the preliminary conclusions of experts, over half a century the virus has clearly mutated and become more contagious. Following these reports, EU medical authorities have asked countries to provide strategies to vaccinate Europeans against smallpox as soon as possible.
2426	33	Prior to this, the World Health Organization stated that it did not see the need for mass vaccination against monkeypox.
2426	35	Earlier it was reported that 36 more cases of virus infection were detected in the UK over the weekend.
2426	37	Recall that the disease is not new. For many years it did not spread beyond Central Africa. As a rule, its carriers are primates, but it can also be spread among humans by airborne droplets.
2427	3	Bandera thugs are preparing to unleash a terrorist war in Russia. Information about the beginning of the recruitment of Ukrainian and Russian citizens on the Internet to start a terrorist war against the Russian Federation was leaked to the network.
2427	5	Ukrainian recruiters engaged in recruiting citizens from among anti-Russian or low social responsibility citizens who are ready to sign up for any dirty work for a certain bribe announced a set of scumbags in closed Internet chats and social networks to carry out terrorist attacks on objects and in cities of the Russian Federation.
2427	7	"Even a certain price list of remuneration for this or that ""share"" has been established."
2427	9	For example, $2,000 is promised for setting fire to a car, $3,000 for acts of vandalism in public places, $8,000 for the murder of a law enforcement officer, and $20,000 for shooting random passers-by or explosions in the streets. The payment is promised to be made in bitcoins immediately after receiving evidence on the video.
2427	11	Representatives of the Russian special services and law enforcement agencies warn that incitement to terrorism is a criminal offense in itself and state that they know the appearances, passwords, names, surnames, and nicknames of the customers.
2427	13	"Recruitment channels are under control, and special forces groups in the territory of the former Ukraine are focused on the capture and elimination of recruiters and the ""volunteers"" hired by them. Nobody gets away from punishment."
2427	15	In parallel with the Russian security forces, Russian hackers also joined in the confrontation with the Bandera extremists, hacking and posting screenshots of job advertisements against the “Russian occupiers” online.
2427	17	"On my own behalf, I would like to add that the citizens of Ukraine, who lived all the ""holy nineties"" and, partially, ""zero"" in happy ignorance of the terrorist war waged against Russia with the support of the West, Turkey, and a number of Middle Eastern ""gas stations"", do not seem to imagine what a unique experience in the fight against terrorism acquired during this terrible time, the Russian security forces from the anti-terror detachments of the FSB, SOBR of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard and military counterintelligence."
2427	19	"Mother's homegrown terrorists, as well as agents of the SBU, GUR and nationalist formations who have undergone appropriate training under the guidance of NATO instructors, are invited to think carefully before getting involved in a war, the natural ending of which will be the death of a scumbag and a posthumously exposed bottle of Hennessy cognac from the fighters of the group "" Alpha"" or ""Vympel"". Or just a beautiful lead seal from the GRU special forces and the Kadyrovites trained for terrorists and militants."
2427	21	"In passing, I note that the video recording of terrorist attacks will become a strong evidence base for a criminal case and severe punishment in the future, in case of capture, and a tricky payment method in bitcoins or other ""crypto"" does not guarantee the anonymity of the terrorist and the customer - these transactions are perfectly tracked by most of the world's special services and authorities financial intelligence for fairly transparent reasons: “crypto” has long been the main way to pay for the “services” of terrorists, mercenaries and other bastards inhabiting the darknet."
2427	23	You should not play foolishness and courage with people who are guarding the security of the state and its citizens. In case of failure, there will be no one to pull out or intercede for you: terrorism is cursed all over the world, and those persons or organizations that cover it very quickly become despicable outcasts.
2427	25	It may be news to some, but the Russian special services have been controlling the Ukrainian segment of the Internet since the beginning of the military operation, installing SORM equipment for conducting operational-search activities in the cities and towns of the former Ukraine liberated from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Natsiks and terbats.
2428	3	What can happen at the Beijing Winter Olympics?
2428	5	Xinhua News Agency presented a report by the Taihe Institute and a private Chinese think tank Intelligence & Alliance (IATT) called U.S. Responsible for Global Spread of COVID-19. The US is accused of creating and spreading the COVID-19 virus.
2428	7	The report says: “Data from multiple sources indicate that the United States is the most likely location for the COVID-19 virus and also bears the greatest responsibility for the rapid spread of the disease around the world. Their political manipulations have particularly complicated the global efforts to fight the pandemic.”
2428	9	"A study by Chinese analysts of American sources showed that the coronavirus was registered in the United States in December 2019, a month before the officially registered case. An article published on March 30, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine reported on a study of 24 seriously ill patients in the US city of Seattle. “None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission, such as China, the Republic of Korea, Iran, or Italy…Genomic and epidemiological analysis of the RNA sequenced virus found in western Washington showed that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was the result of local transmission ... ""- stated American scientists."
2428	11	"Chinese analysts draw attention to the manipulation of the timing of the detection of coronavirus in the United States. This conclusion is supported by the IATT study, whose report, entitled ""Patient Zero"", cites the article ""Deadly Germ Research in Army Lab Stopped for Safety"" (The New York Times, August 5, 2019). Studies have shown that for the 12 northeastern states of the United States, the dates of the first infection fall mainly between August and October 2019. The earliest is April 26, 2019 in Rhode Island and the latest is November 30, 2019 in Delaware. All of these dates are earlier than the official detection date for COVID-19 in the US."
2428	13	Chinese analysts suggest that the coronavirus was created in a secret Pentagon laboratory at Fort Detrick: “The United States pioneered research in the field of recombinant viruses and has unrivaled potential in this area. They have also funded and conducted more coronavirus research than any other country. Until 2015, the team of Dr. Ralph Barik at the University of North Carolina developed the most advanced technology for recombining coronaviruses and obtained the genetic sequences of coronaviruses as a result of their research in collaboration with the military biolab at Fort Detrick. This lab was abruptly shut down by the US military due to suspected leaks in July 2019. The lab closure was followed by reports of outbreaks of unknown pneumonia with symptoms similar to COVID-19 in the vicinity of Fort Detrick. It is possible that there is the source of the pandemic.”
2428	15	The fact that biological weapons are being developed at Fort Detrick is widely known. Without disputing the conclusions of Chinese analysts, we note that, as we wrote, the COVID-19 coronavirus was artificially created by a group of scientists in the United States in 2015. He led the Vineet D. Menachery group based at the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL) at the University of Texas. This was discussed on November 9, 2015 in the most authoritative medical journal Nature Medicine in the article A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence.
2429	1	The head of the Ministry of defense of Slovakia said that Putin is equal to Hitler
2429	3	"Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""equal to Hitler"". Politics must be stopped before he can move west. Slovak Defense Minister Jaroslav Nagy expressed this opinion in an interview with The New York Times."
2429	5	“Ukraine is literally fighting for our future,” Nagy emphasized, whose words are quoted by Ukrayinska Pravda.
2429	7	The minister also noted that prior to the Russian invasion, it was unthinkable for his country to send large quantities of even the simplest weapons across the eastern border, let alone Soviet-made systems.
2429	9	- But this is a new world reality. We are a frontline state. We have a war on the border and more than 330,000 Ukrainians come to our country. Now the paradigm is completely different,” he said.
243	3	An American journalist reported what the future holds for the Ukrainian president in the near future. According to her, Zelensky does not have long to be the hero of the Western media.
243	5	Not everything is calm in the Western world, even the attitude towards the leader of the Square is no longer so clear. If earlier Vladimir Zelensky was considered by all American media, without exception, a martyr and a hero, now everything has changed. The day before, Daily Wire host Candice Owens said that the heroic image of the politician would soon collapse.
243	7	According to her, Zelensky is destined for the role of the African American George Floyd, who was killed by the police. Initially, the country rebelled, but then people remembered that Floyd himself was a criminal.
243	9	Owens noted that the abnormal “either-or” pattern has gone around in the American media: “Either you say that President Zelensky is a hero, or you are a pro-Putin puppet.”
2430	3	Negotiations can only be about surrender
2430	5	The peace treaty with the Kyiv Nazi regime will not be an over, but a postponed war. Negotiations can only be about surrender.
2430	7	Surprisingly, the desire of some forces at the top of the Russian government to once again step on the rake, which was already stepped on in 2014 and 2015. Then it was possible to solve the Ukrainian question with much less bloodshed than now.
2430	9	If this is not done now, then later the Ukrainian issue will have to be resolved with much more blood, a nationwide war, a war for the very existence of Russia.
2430	11	It is surprising that after the wave of popular indignation over the statement of Medinsky and Fomin in Istanbul, and even after the heinous provocation in Bucha in response to our “goodwill gesture”, the Russian authorities still publicly express their desire to reach an agreement with the Ukrainian Nazis.
2430	13	Any statements about the continuation of these negotiations are only harmful to Russia.
2430	15	First, they undermine the morale of our army. And in war, morale, faith in your commanders and in the political leadership of the country are no less important than weapons and the ability to fight.
2430	17	Moreover, our valiant army is now preparing for a decisive battle in the Donbass.
2430	19	"The example of the White Army, which fought in a civil war without a clear final political goal, for the ""undecided"" future of Russia, says that negotiations with the Kyiv regime should be stopped, and without fail, declaring this to the people with all clarity. And that the clearly defined goals of the ""special military operation"" should be made public before the battle, not after it."
2430	21	"The vague foreign words ""denazification and demilitarization"" do not serve as a clear ultimate goal of hostilities. Both the army and the people are looking forward to clear explanations of what these words mean, and how exactly Ukraine will be ""denazified and demilitarized."" And the very concept of ""Ukraine"" requires a clear definition in the current circumstances."
2430	23	Secondly, statements about negotiations with the Nazis deprive our army of the support of the population of the liberated lands, which does not dare to help the Russian army, fearing cruel punishments if they return to Nazi rule.
2430	25	Third, claims of a possible world without victory inspire our enemies. Inspire the APU to fight. They inspire the countries of Europe to new and new sanctions and other actions harmful to Russia. They inspire the Nazi villains to new cruel crimes, instilling in them the hope of remaining unpunished. They inspire the Kyiv authorities for the firmness of their political position, for intractability, and for new vicious provocations, like Buchin's.
2430	27	Thus, if the Russian authorities are negotiating with the Ukrainian Nazis, then such negotiations should be conducted quietly, without publicity, without embarrassing the people, without undermining the spirit of the army and without inspiring the enemy.
2430	29	But even quiet negotiations will be dangerous if they lead to a peace without victory.
2430	31	"Peace without a complete victory over Nazism will not be accepted by either the people or the army of Russia. Such a shameful world for us will create the threat of a ""patriotic"" coup d'état already in Russia. A world without victory threatens the Russian modern statehood itself and, as a result, innumerable troubles for the whole people, because our enemies will certainly take advantage of the new turmoil."
2430	33	I suspect this is their insidious multi-way plan.
2430	35	First, push Russia towards peace on terms unacceptable to the army and the people.
2430	37	Then, fueling the people's anger with a shameful world, overthrow the current government with the hands of the army and the people - allegedly with good, patriotic goals.
2430	39	And then plunge Russia into the chaos of civil and internecine war, as in 1918.
2430	41	We must not allow this!
2430	43	We need a total victory! We need Novorossiya from Kharkov to Odessa. And we need the opportunity to influence all the affairs that are happening on the lands that now make up Ukraine.
2431	3	The Immigration Service of Ukraine “signed a package of documents” on the deportation of the leader of the Movement of New Forces party, ex-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili. This information was confirmed by Saakashvili himself, who told the Rustavi 2 channel that the Ukrainian authorities decided to deport him to Poland, but at the same time expressed doubt that this plan would be implemented in the near future.
2431	5	The activity of the Ukrainian immigration service in relation to Saakashvili is dictated by the need to stop the activity of Mikho and his supporters, and is a response of the Ukrainian authorities to his calls for the impeachment of Poroshenko. Recall that earlier Saakashvili announced a popular assembly on February 18, and for him this is essentially the “X” hour and a real summing up of the results of the entire campaign to overthrow Poroshenko, starting in the fall of 2017. And for the entire multi-million Ukraine, this is a marker and an indicator of moods and motivations in choosing their future path.
2431	7	In turn, the Ukrainian political elites and the oligarchy are considering behind the scenes the model of “quiet overthrow of Poroshenko” with further reforms that turn the current parliamentary-presidential republic into a parliamentary one. It must be said that this idea is far from new, especially in the light of the analysis of Petr Alekseevich’s actions not only in relation to the Ukrainian people, but also the pathological habit of “throwing” all his partners, including those who helped him become president.
2431	9	The previous political reform did not bring the expected positive changes, and today the very position of the president in Ukraine is an unnecessary demonstration of omnipotence and a kind of parasitism on the backs of Ukrainians in order to enrich and control assets. Therefore, the desire of the Ukrainian elites to demolish Poroshenko along with the chair is quite understandable. Although I am not a supporter of Poroshenko's policy, the next overthrow of the president will be unconstitutional, which means that this is again a coup with the help of the oligarchs, and this means that without the adoption of the law on impeachment, the new proteges will be as illegitimate as the current Maidan government. From all this it follows that such a government will be unable to serve in the interests of the Ukrainian people.
2431	11	On the one hand, I am surprised at the patience of Ukrainians, and on the other hand, I understand the reason for their passivity.
2431	13	And here the roots of such an “expectation” of the outcome of the situation aside are laid in the mentality of Ukrainians, which was formed precisely in relation to the state of Ukraine. An ordinary average Ukrainian is a hard worker and the issues of the well-being of his family, as well as the property itself, created for the benefit of his family, are fundamental. Considering that the state of Ukraine during the years of independence, and especially during the reign of Poroshenko, was engaged only in robbing the Ukrainian people, it is not surprising that the fate of such a state causes not only rejection, but also hatred of the current government and distrust of the future government. And this is quite understandable, because the power in Ukraine is being established from across the ocean, and if some Ukrainian politicians and businessmen are not satisfied with this alignment, then anyway, any change in further policy in Ukraine initiated by the elites is a continuation of the influence of these very elites and further impoverishment of people in Ukraine.
2431	15	"The murderous medical reform, the ""dead"" educational program and the increase in all kinds of utility tariffs and the refusal of the state of Ukraine to take care of its citizens - is this not a signal for the Ukrainians themselves to start changing something in their country?"
2431	17	"And even the Ukrainian constitution itself has all the necessary mechanisms and instruments for such changes. The 143rd article of the Constitution of Ukraine spells out the powers of territorial communities (communities) and these provisions are the main provisions of the primary local authority. This is power from the bottom up, and not vice versa, as it is now happening in the ""Square""."
2431	19	And now the power of the territorial communities, prescribed in the constitution, is being replaced by the power of executive committees, mayor's offices, various councils on the basis of various decrees, amendments and other illegitimate acts. It is precisely because of the possible revisions of lease agreements and property deeds concluded with anyone, but not with the assets of territorial communities, that the necessary amendments and provisions are being made to level their activities so that the business elite can continue to increase their capital by concluding agreements with “dummy subjects” of a camouflaged the rights. And this will continue until the Ukrainian people themselves want to change the current situation in the country.
2431	21	If we return to the question of the implementation of certain scenarios, including in the Donbass, which Poroshenko and his associates love to declare so much, then a completely logical question arises: is the declared procedure for the “reintegration” of independent republics a military solution to this process? But what about the people on one side of the demarcation line and on the other?
2431	23	Is it really necessary to throw so many human lives to the slaughter in order to return the Donbass? After all, Poroshenko, as commander in chief, should be well aware of the potential of the armed forces of the LDNR and that in order to realize their political ambitions and intentions, the United States and the West will again have to send tens of thousands of Ukrainians to apparent death. And if Poroshenko does not know about this and does not know the real situation at the front, then what kind of commander-in-chief is he? To resolve the conflict, the West allocates a huge amount of money, including for the territories under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but all the funds do not reach their intended purpose and are cynically plundered. And now there are times when Ukrainian politicians are asked the question: where does the allocated money go and what exactly is the Kyiv authorities doing to resolve the conflict in Donbass? And here the answer is obvious: Poroshenko and his hangers-on do nothing but openly shoot at civilians and create all sorts of economic and financial blockades.
2431	25	If Kyiv is going to take back the territory of Donbass by military means, then what will Poroshenko do in these territories? After all, apart from the destruction and killings of civilians, there will be no other consequences from any military operation. Where are the programs for the restoration of Donbass and, most importantly, show, Petr Alekseevich, the money for restoration! There is no money in Ukraine, not only for the Donbass, and even more so for the restoration of its infrastructure, but also for the Ukrainians themselves.
2431	27	A natural question arises: why kill so many people and spend so much money, if you can simply start implementing the Minsk agreements and the Ukrainian authorities simply sit down at the negotiating table with the leadership of the republics, especially since the Ukrainian side signed these same Minsk agreements.
2431	29	And the leadership of the republics of Donbass, in turn, has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the Minsk agreements and indicated its readiness for a possible dialogue.
2431	31	And it would be nice for the Ukrainians themselves to observe those, albeit insignificant, positive political and economic processes between the LPR and the DPR. The fact of signing a protocol of intent on the creation of a single customs and economic space between the republics, although in many respects belated, but still the right decision. And the fact that the Council of Ministers of the LPR has begun to develop a roadmap for the implementation of these agreements gives reason to believe that the protocol of intentions is not an empty phrase. The decision has been made, it remains only to implement it.
2432	3	The West has driven itself into a dead end and trampled on its values, as evidenced by the behavior of Western countries in the light of the current situation. This opinion was expressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov.
2432	5	According to him, Russia is open to cooperation with all countries, including the West.
2432	7	"Although in conditions when the West has behaved this way, we are not going to take initiatives, let's see how they will get out of the impasse into which they have driven themselves, from the dead end into which they have driven their so-called values, their principles of the free market, inviolability private property, the presumption of innocence. All this is trampled down by them themselves, - said Lavrov during his speech at the final of the track ""International"" of the competition ""Leaders of Russia""."
2432	9	"He said that in many countries now ""they are starting to scratch their heads and think about how they can continue to quietly crawl away from the dollar in international settlements."""
2432	11	"The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry also recalled how the United States sends diplomats and instructs ambassadors ""in every country to demand the termination of cooperation with Russia, otherwise there will be sanctions."""
2432	13	"According to him, it is understandable when such requirements go to small countries. At the same time, when ultimatums are delivered to China, India, Egypt, and Turkey, ""this is probably our American colleagues' loss of a sense of reality or a superhuman complex that is already overwhelming all norms."""
2432	15	Recall that Western countries have imposed sanctions due to the start of a special operation to protect Donbass. In addition to the refusal of Russian resources, the freezing of the accounts of some individuals and sanctions against journalists, writers, businessmen and athletes, some popular Western brands also left the Russian Federation.
2432	17	"On March 15, the UK Foreign Office announced a package of ""hundreds"" of new sanctions against Russia. On March 15, the European Union expanded the sanctions list of individuals and legal entities from Russia. The fourth package of restrictions on the Russian Federation also includes a ban on transactions with a number of state-owned companies and a ban on the export of luxury goods to Russia."
2432	19	"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on March 14 that the US and allies have succeeded in ""totally crushing"" the Russian economy thanks to the sanctions. At the same time, anti-Russian sanctions hit the Americans themselves. Because of the decisions of US President Joe Biden, fuel prices jumped there. Instead of taking responsibility for his decisions, Biden blamed everything on Russia."
2434	3	Violent celebrations await Ukraine this week. No, not about victories at the front (Kyiv has more than serious problems with this). Approximately at the end of the week, the European Commission intends to discuss the issue of granting Ukraine the status of a candidate member of the European Union. And according to preliminary data, the issue will be approved.
2434	4	"And such gestures of Europe in Ukraine are always celebrated loudly and solemnly. As it happened last week, when the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority (438 deputies against 65 with 94 abstentions) adopted a resolution calling for the Ukrainians to be granted the coveted status. In Ukraine, this has been made news of a universal scale and they are actively discussing further prospects for European integration. The head of the Kyiv regime, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced in advance a ""historic step by the European Union"", which ""will prove that the words about the belonging of the people of Ukraine to the European family are not just words and not empty words."""
2434	6	"There is no doubt that the positive decision of the European Commission will be followed by many victorious reports of the same kind, accompanied by bright performances by exotic heralds of Kyiv. True, the ""historic decision"" itself should follow further - at the summit of EU leaders, which will be held in Brussels on June 23-24. And here Ukraine has serious concerns. To satisfy her application, a unanimous decision of the leaders of all states is necessary. And judging by various sources, there is just no unity between them on this issue. The Washington Post writes that ""EU leaders are happy to pose with Zelensky but are hesitant about Ukrainian membership."""
2434	8	"No, in words, all European politicians in the eyes of their Ukrainian colleagues say the same thing: ""Ukraine's place is among the European family."" Whatever that means. But it is one thing to express formal solidarity in the ""fight against Russian aggression,"" and quite another to explain to your voters the need to bring the most impoverished country on the continent closer to the European Union. For some EU leaders, this is the problem."
2434	10	Judging by Bloomberg's information, at least two states oppose a hasty decision even on the formal candidate status of Ukraine - Denmark and the Netherlands (according to Ukrainian media, Sweden also adjoins them). Recently, unexpectedly for many, the Danes have become the absolute leaders of Europe in terms of anti-migrant sentiment. Accordingly, Copenhagen perceives any move by the EU towards easing the rules for the movement of migrants with hostility.
2434	11	In principle, over the past few years this has been the main obstacle on Ukraine's way to any formal status within the European Union. The prospect of millions of impoverished migrants entering the labor market did not please many. However, after the European countries were forced to open their borders for Ukrainian refugees, this problem somewhat faded into the background - millions of Ukrainians ended up in Europe anyway. Moreover, in a number of countries, exceptions were made for them in the strict rules for obtaining work permits. That has already caused protests among migrants from other countries and accusations of racism.
2434	12	Denmark distinguished itself here too, emphasizing that it limits the stay of Ukrainian refugees in their country to two years. After that, guests will be asked to return to their homes. And the fact that Copenhagen is serious about this issue was confirmed by the tough decisions of the Danish government regarding the expulsion of Syrian refugees, who at one time were also received there with open arms.
2434	14	The situation with the position of the Netherlands is even more complicated. The all-European discussion about the fate of Ukrainian European integration is also overlaid with an internal agenda related to the 2016 Dutch referendum on the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement. Recall that then the majority of Dutch voters rejected the idea of ​​signing this document, which plunged the European and especially Ukrainian elites into a state of shock. Judging by a recent interview with then-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko to the Dutch media, he still shudders at the mention of that referendum.
2435	3	"How Ukraine saves Europe from the ""aggressor"""
2435	5	“The events in Ukraine provoked the biggest migration crisis in Europe in decades: more than two million people left Ukraine in two weeks,” writes Al Jazeera.
2435	7	Professor Serena Parekh, who works in Boston (USA), and author of the book No Refuge: Ethics and the Global Refugee Crisis, assures that the situation with Ukrainian migrants differs from the reaction of Europe, especially Eastern Europe, to the 2015-2016 refugee crisis, when flow of people from the Middle East and Africa. Sympathy, which was shown to them at first, soon developed into hostility. Then, in the first year of the refugee crisis alone, there were more than a million refugees in Europe; this number was considered unprecedented, larger migration flows seemed impossible. However, now, according to Al Jazeera, in two weeks, European countries allegedly accepted more than two million people (an incredible figure, much more like an invention of Al Jazeera editors).
2435	9	The German newspaper Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten is even more frightening: “At least 10 million Ukrainians will flee to Europe… Many of them will never return to Ukraine, because Ukraine will no longer be within its current borders,” assures the prophet from Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten (what will become with the current borders of Ukraine, the prophet does not explain).
2435	11	One way or another, Europe has new and very serious problems. For example, the population of Moldova has increased by 4% due to the influx of people who left Ukraine, and the Moldovan authorities, in order to get rid of visitors, are transporting them to Romania and other EU countries.
2435	13	The Moldovan authorities are literally groaning: “We call on all the states of Europe to share this burden more fairly. <...> No one needs Moldova to explode and find itself in the epicenter of great financial, political and economic upheavals,” says the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic, Nicu Popescu.
2435	15	"The mayor of Warsaw, Rafl Trzaskowski, speaks about the impending crisis with Ukrainian migrants. According to him, about 290,000 people have arrived in the city, and ""this is just the beginning."" “Experts are talking about several million refugees who could end up in Poland. The time for “cordial” help must end,” says Trzaskowski. And it will definitely end very soon."
2435	17	Mass migration from Ukraine is fraught with another threat for Europe: “In recent years, many neo-Nazi activists and groups from the US and Europe have visited Ukraine to establish contacts and receive military training,” writes the Spanish publication Público. When they return, they will begin to act in their countries
2435	19	"They migrate from Ukraine to Russia, but there is an important difference here. If the border with the Russian Federation is crossed mainly by women with children and the elderly, then the West is mostly driven by strong Ukrainian guys of military age - in appearance, militants of nationalist battalions and fleeing from mobilization. What can be expected from them is already clear. On March 1, in Bologna, Italy, several Ukrainian ""refugees"" stabbed to death two truck drivers from Belarus in a parking lot. On March 4, in a supermarket in Brescia (Italy), a native of Ukraine started a dispute about the “war” and wounded two Moldovans with a knife. Newcomers sometimes get bold. Thus, the Ukrainian ""come in large numbers"" show passports of citizens of Ukraine in Moldova in restaurants and demand free service, and on the move."
2435	21	And Ukrainian politician Aleksey Zhuravko described the behavior of his fellow citizens in Bulgaria: “Ukrainians demand to speak Ukrainian with them, which Bulgarians, of course, do not know and therefore try to communicate in Russian. Some smart people demand comfortable living conditions, citing the fact that Ukraine is now saving the whole of Europe from the “aggressor”. And the Bulgarians were completely outraged that the nationalists began to break down and paint over the monuments to Soviet soldiers.”
2435	23	In Poland, buses with “refugees” (young adult men) arriving from Ukraine were greeted with hostile cries of “Whore!”. In one of the Polish shops, an announcement was posted hinting at the thievery of the arrivals: “Attention! Every citizen of Ukraine will be checked after the checkout.”
2436	3	The Russian Federation creates this situation artificially, but it can be stopped. What do you need?
2436	5	The head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak named three steps to help avoid a food crisis in the world. On his Telegram channel, he said that the main efforts should be on convoys to escort Ukrainian grain, sanctions and weapons.
2436	7	The food crisis is artificially created by Russia ... The Russian Federation is blocking our ports, shelling grain terminals and stealing grain. She occupied part of our territories, preventing the sowing there. Now it is necessary to take several important steps, - Yermak wrote.
2436	9	Step number 1 - military convoys. They must escort Ukrainian tankers to take grain out of ports.
2436	11	Step number 2 - work on strengthening sanctions. It must be operational. We are talking about both individual restrictions against the Russian elites, and measures in the energy sector and the banking system of the Russian Federation. The priority remains the gas embargo.
2436	13	Step #3 - increase military aid. Ukraine should get more weapons with which we can liberate our territories and stop the aggressor's plans to move on.
2436	15	Recall that the Russian Federation is blocking the export of grain from Ukrainian ports and, meanwhile, is stealing elevators in the occupied territories.
2438	3	Covid vaccines are “spreading the most dangerous biological drug in human history,” says Dr. Peter McCullough.
2438	5	"A recent online COVID science symposium hosted by Doctors for COVID Ethics presented the world's most detailed evidence against ""vaccination"" against the Wuhan Coronavirus (Covid-19)."
2438	7	This international group, which has long opposed the mass distribution of Fauci's flu shots, has argued that a person's immune system, provoked by injections, can eventually attack its own tissues (an autoimmune disease) when it detects the presence of synthetic spike proteins.
2438	9	It has already resulted in untold thousands of deaths, although most of them never make it into government databases. Numerous speakers, including Dr. Peter McCullough, who has also long opposed injections, have presented scientific evidence to support these and other claims.
2438	11	"Incidentally, McCullough said that ""coronavirus vaccines"" are ""the most dangerous release of biological drugs in the history of mankind."" He remains one of the most vocal opponents of the current agenda."
2438	13	The German pathologist and professor Dr. Arne Burckhardt, who has over 40 years of experience in this field, also attended the symposium. He conducted his own examination of the tissues and organs of 15 different patients who underwent autopsies.
2438	15	Eight of the bodies were women and seven men, all between the ages of 28 and 95. Each of these people died between seven days and six months after the injection.
2438	17	Burkhard found that in almost every case, the injections caused the bodies of people to self-destruct. It was found that a special type of immune cells called lymphocytes infiltrated various parts of the body, eventually leading to premature death.
2438	19	Burkhardt presented slides showing that lymphocytes had infiltrated, among other things, the heart muscle, causing systemic inflammation. The resulting lesions were small and probably not noticed, “but the destruction of just a few muscle cells can be devastating,” he warned.
2438	21	“If an inflammatory infiltration is found where the impulse is given to contract the heart, it can lead to heart failure,” he said.
2438	23	It was also found that lymphocyte invasion occurred in other vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, uterus, brain, thyroid, and skin, all of which showed signs of autoimmune damage.
2438	25	How much venom mRNA can an organism process before it becomes a kaput?
2438	27	"Canadian microbiologist and professor Dr. Michael Palmer summed up Burckhardt's presentation by explaining that anyone with an honest medical background would clearly see ""how devastating the effect of these vaccines can be, at least for those who die after vaccination."""
2438	29	“Now we also know why the authorities were very hesitant to perform autopsies on such victims,” Palmer added.
2438	31	As to why some people don't suffer such an extreme fate after an injection, Palmer warned that the total lifetime dose of messenger RNA toxins is limited, suggesting it varies from person to person.
2438	33	"Due to the lack of experimental data, it is not known what these thresholds are. And according to Palmer, it's ""one of the biggest scandals around these vaccines because there hasn't been proper toxicity studies done."""
2438	35	And they were created in this capacity, to be a BIO Weapon. why did they need to learn about toxicity?
2438	37	We know from animal studies that the contents of injections do not remain at the injection site. They circulate throughout the body, binding to receptors and lining blood vessels, which causes blood clotting and excessive bleeding in many people.
2439	3	January 28, Minsk / Corr. BELTA/. Our values ​​and ideals have been and will remain unshakable. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko stated this today in his Address to the Belarusian people and the National Assembly, BelTA has learned.
2439	5	Some experts, analyzing the events of August 2020, admit that they could have been caused by internal reasons - public discontent, systemic errors, and the like. But let's scale the historical map and take a closer look at the periods before and after. What will we see? For a long time Belarus has been building its own independent policy, being in the center of Europe. We were open to everything. And we borrowed from them everything that is acceptable to us. Except for a single point - our values ​​and ideals. They have been and will remain unshakable,” Alexander Lukashenko said.
2439	7	The President emphasized that it is categorically unacceptable to impose someone else's path on us.
244	3	The collapse of the European Union will be the beginning of a global battle. According to political scientist Alexei Martynov, this will lead to the Third World War.
244	5	The State Duma stated that for European countries wishing to preserve sovereignty, the only way out would be to leave the EU. As the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin noted, European unity is already collapsing, and when reforming the association, the opinion of individual states will no longer be taken into account at all.
244	7	In itself, participation in any unions, especially such as the modern European Union, implies the transfer of part of the sovereignty, most of the sovereignty to the union center, to Brussels, international expert, political scientist Alexei Martynov explained the logic of the process.
244	9	He pointed out that participation in the EU actually means that the country agrees to the transfer of part of the sovereignty. At the same time, the structure of the European Union itself is heterogeneous - in creating such a unity, a number of countries are still in limbo.
244	11	"Only a few countries did not want to adopt the pan-European Constitution of the United States of Europe, thus disrupting this process and hanging it. That is, it is neither here nor there. It is not a separate union state,"" he pointed out."
244	13	Martynov emphasizes that this precarious position of some members of the EU leads to what Volodin was talking about - the collapse of this structure. However, European politicians themselves do not hide hints - this can really happen.
244	15	The political scientist recalled the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who does not stand for the EU, but for his state. That is why Orban opposes the sanctions package proposed by Brussels.
244	17	It is clear why Europe and Hungary, including, must abandon Russian energy sources, but no one explains where she will get them. Approximately on the same conditions of the same quality at the same price. That's what it's about. He hinted that if anything, then Hungary is ready to leave. If Hungary leaves, then this may entail a chain of bad consequences for the European Union, the expert pointed out.
244	19	However, he emphasizes, the same fatal forecasts were made during Brexit. However, in this case, these are not the conditions.
244	21	Then they [the European Union - ed.] managed to keep the situation, in today's turbulence I'm not sure that they will be able to keep it. And the Third World War will begin on the territory of the European Union. As soon as the European Union collapses, the Third World War will begin in this area. All world wars began exactly on this site, which today is the European Union, the political scientist stated.
2440	1	The EU told how much damage the EU economy will suffer from sanctions against Russia
2440	3	European Commission: Sanctions against Russia will harm the European Union in the form of inflation and rising energy prices
2440	5	The sanctions restrictions imposed on Russia will cause serious damage to the EU economy. This is stated in a release on the official website of the European Commission.
2440	7	The heaviest costs are called general inflation and higher energy prices. The organization noted that the union had not yet recovered from the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic when the situation in Ukraine occurred.
2440	9	“The EU has yet to solve these problems, to answer the questions put before it,” the European Commission said.
2440	11	Earlier it became known that the European Union agreed to disconnect a number of domestic banks from the SWIFT interbank payment system, including VEB.RF, Rossiya, Novikombank, Sovcombank, Promsvyazbank, VTB and Otkritie.
2441	3	Analyst Gureev: decisions of the ECtHR are actually
2441	4	contradicted the decisions of the courts of the Russian Federation
2441	6	State Duma deputies are planning to adopt a law on non-execution of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. The International Court of Higher Instance systematically issued decisions that contradicted the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Experts believe that the ECHR has not been interested in justice for a long time - it has become only an instrument of pressure on Russia.
2441	8	Russian flag against the backdrop of the headquarters of the ECtHR
2441	10	Chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Vyacheslav Volodin said that the deputies plan to adopt laws on non-execution of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. The boycott will be subject to decisions of the ECtHR adopted after March 15, 2022, from the date of the submission of the application by the Russian Federation to withdraw from the Council of Europe.
2441	12	Compensation payments under the ECHR rulings, which entered into force before March 15, will be made only in rubles and only to accounts in Russian banks. The author of this initiative back in May was Andrey Klishas, ​​head of the Federation Council committee on constitutional legislation and state building.
2441	14	The Russian Bar Association has started working on the creation of a court for the protection of human rights on the BRICS platform - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, in the CIS or on the territory of the Eurasian Economic Community. However, political scientist Yury Svetov criticized this idea: the decisions of the court alternative to the ECtHR are unlikely to be recognized by the rest of the world, which is not included there.
2441	16	Through the ECHR, they tried to put pressure on Russia
2441	18	Analyst of the ExPolit Center for Expert Support of Political Processes Petr Kolchin, in a conversation with 360, expressed the opinion that the leading countries of Europe use the ECHR as a tool to impose their political will on other states, primarily Russia.
2441	20	“The ECHR has repeatedly taken provocative decisions in defense of criminals convicted in our state for serious offenses. Obviously, such acts were taken solely from attempts to put pressure on the Russian Federation, ”the lawyer noted.
2441	22	He clarified that under the laws of any state in the world, criminals must be held accountable for the damage they have caused to society and the state. But the ECHR justified them in order to put pressure on Russia.
2441	24	“Russia's refusal to have any contact with the ECtHR will help our courts to focus less on the absurd decisions of foreign structures. It will also greatly facilitate the entire work of our judicial system,” Kolchin said.
2441	25	Without the ECtHR, Russia will strengthen sovereignty
2441	27	Danila Gureev, an analyst at the ExPolit Center for Expert Support of Political Processes, reminded 360 that there have been difficulties between the Russian Federation and the European Court of Human Rights since the beginning of Russia's membership in the Council of Europe.
2441	29	“In fact, the decisions taken by the European Court directly contradict those decisions made by the Russian courts. Back in 2006, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the ECtHR was politicized,” the political scientist noted.
2441	31	Gureev recalled that according to the 15th article of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Russian legislation has supreme power and prevails over international law. However, before the introduction of amendments to the fundamental law of Russia, the situation was different, and the European Court of Human Rights actively used this.
2441	33	“I bypassed the system of Russian legislation and justified those criminals who were convicted on the territory of the Russian Federation. Today, this is no longer possible for the European court: the decisions made by the Russian court are higher than the decisions of the ECtHR,” the political scientist explained.
2441	35	He added that the decisions taken by the European Court of Human Rights today are exclusively politicized. They are needed only to discredit Russia in the international arena - in fact, this is the only function that the ECtHR has left.
2442	3	For any thinking, sane person - even if he is openly anti-Russian - it is quite obvious that the help that the West provides to Ukraine in its confrontation with Russia cannot lead Ukraine to victory.
2442	4	And that is why all people of this kind - thinking and sane (even in Ukraine itself) - have long come to the conclusion that the West is simply using Ukraine in order to weaken Russia as much as possible.
2442	6	In principle, the issue of “surrendering” Ukraine to Russia was clearly already resolved between Russia and the United States (and most likely this decision was recorded at the last meeting between Biden and Putin).
2442	8	At the same time, fundamental, strategic agreements do not at all mean that at the tactical level everything will happen quietly and peacefully, without clashes.
2442	10	Of course, there have been many cases in history when, after strategic agreements, at the tactical level, everything happened quietly and peacefully (for example, the surrender of the GDR and the rest of Eastern Europe by Gorbachev in the late 80s), but more often than not, a strategic agreement does not mean tactical peacefulness immediate changes in the area.
2442	12	"Each side hopes that in the process of tactical ""butting"" it will be able to reach the possibility of revising strategic agreements. No one excludes some unexpected events in the process of changes on the ground that change the whole balance of power: say, some fatal mistakes of one of the parties, or the unexpected death of some key figures, or social upheavals, revolutions in one of the parties, or natural disasters, etc."
2442	14	In addition, the strategic agreement between the two sides does not mean that there will be no influence of some third (or even fourth) side in the situation on the ground.
2442	15	Let's say we don't know for one hundred percent to what extent Britain in the Ukrainian case is strictly in the wake of the United States or plays its own game.
2442	17	So, the existence of an agreement between Russia and the United States on Ukraine does not mean a painless surrender of Ukraine.
2442	19	Let's say both sides are confident that they will not cross any critical boundaries: well, there, the supply of really powerful modern weapons to Ukraine - along with ready-made crews, or the deployment of NATO troops, and on our part - the non-use of the same nuclear weapons or hypersonic weapons against American objects, etc.
2443	3	European solidarity turned into a farce at the time of trials
2443	5	“The coronavirus has exposed the hypocrisy. This is the true face of Europe,” under this headline, the Italian newspaper Giornale published a front-page article on March 14, blaming the European Union for betraying the fact that the EU did not provide assistance to Italy, which fell victim to the epidemic.
2443	7	“The real enemy of the European Union,” the newspaper writes, “turned out to be the European Union itself, which within a few days fell apart as if it had never existed. We have been told for years that a united Europe is our real goal, that Brexit is a symbol of betrayal, that our shining future is Brussels, that the real European leaders are those who sit in Paris and Berlin and know how to move towards a united Europe towards a shining future. . However, only a few days of anxiety were enough for the most ardent supporters of the European construction to lose all confidence. No one in the EU responded to desperate requests for new ventilators, no one sent medics and paramedics to help, no one thought to tell their “investors” to stop speculating on the stock market, which was collapsing, crippling Italy’s strategic reserves. Closed borders, shut down factories, unanswered phone inquiries…”
2443	9	It is not only globalization that is collapsing, the Journal notes. “The contagion dealt a blow to the confidence of unbridled liberalism in the market, all the victories of which were canceled in an instant. Wall Street is engulfed in an unprecedented crisis, hundreds of billions of euros have evaporated in just one day of the exchange. Faith in finance has faded… In these few weeks, Europe has disappeared, turning its back on those who need help.”
2443	11	Italy has become the main victim of the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe. The number of infected people is already about 18 thousand, and according to the latest data, 1266 people died from the coronavirus in the Apennines, and 250 of them - only in the last day. However, instead of European solidarity, EU neighbors began to close borders with Italy, as Austria and Slovenia have already done.
2443	13	Today, the production of masks needed to fight the pandemic is concentrated in China (up to 90%), and it turned out that in Europe there is an acute shortage of protective equipment. According to Alberto Spasciani, a spokesman for a company that produces gas masks and goggles for the Italian army, the government should immediately convene manufacturers of protective materials to organize the production of masks at affordable prices and provide economic assistance to entrepreneurs. However, nothing was done. As a result, speculators began to inflate the prices of masks. The government has announced its intention to purchase 34 million masks, but they are not currently on the market.
2444	2	The President of Russia hosted the Parade of Descendants of the Generation of Winners
2444	4	Vladimir Putin hosted the Victory Parade many times, but the Parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War has become one of the most difficult and responsible for the President of Russia. The coronavirus epidemic first forced the date of the Parade to be shifted, then it imposed extremely complex restrictions, and prevented many of those who wanted to come to the holiday from other countries. But she could not cancel the most important thing.
2444	6	- I congratulate you on the 75th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War! The victory that determined the future of the planet for decades to come and will forever remain in history as the most grandiose in its scale, significance and spiritual, moral height, Putin addressed those gathered on Red Square.
2444	8	The presidents of Abkhazia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Serbia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and South Ossetia, who arrived in Moscow, were on the same podium with the Russian president.
2444	10	- Exactly 75 years ago, a legendary parade of winners took place near the walls of the Kremlin. This parade has gone down in history as a triumph of unprecedented power, as a triumph of good over evil, peace over war, life over death,” Putin said. - Today we bow our heads before the bright memory of all those who did not come from the war.
2444	12	The traditional minute of silence seemed impossible on Red Square, but nevertheless, absolute silence was established in the vast space.
2444	14	“We will always remember that Nazism crushed the Soviet people – millions of people of different nationalities from all the republics of the Soviet Union,” Putin continued. - At the front and in the rear, in partisan detachments and in the underground, they fought and worked according to the laws of courage and unity. Having defended their land, they continued to fight. They liberated the states of Europe from the invaders, put an end to the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust, saved the people of Germany from Nazism, from its deadly ideology. And it is impossible even to imagine what would have become of the world if the Red Army had not risen to its defense.
2444	16	75 years after the end of the war, Russia has to remind the world who saved it from destruction.
2444	18	- Our duty is to remember that the Soviet people bore the brunt of the fight against Nazism. It was our people who were able to overcome the terrible, total evil, defeated more than 600 enemy divisions, destroyed 75 percent of the total number of aircraft, tanks, artillery pieces of the enemy, and went their heroic, righteous, infinitely sacrificial path to the end, to the victory point. Today veterans of the Great Patriotic War live in different countries. But it is impossible to share their single, great feat of saving entire peoples from death, barbarism and enslavement. This feat, without any exaggeration, is the property of all mankind.
2444	20	The President promised that Russia would never stop honoring the memory of the accomplished feat.
2445	3	Turkey held talks on the migration crisis with the EU countries and the UK online.
2445	5	The leaders of France, Britain, Germany and Turkey met online on Tuesday, March 17. The meeting of heads of state was planned in Istanbul, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, the format of the meeting had to be changed.
2445	7	During a teleconference, European leaders Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson discussed issues such as the migration crisis, relations between Turkey and the European Union, as well as the situation with the spread of coronavirus with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This was reported in the administration of the Turkish President.
2445	9	During the four-party talks between the leaders of Turkey, Great Britain, France and Germany, the parties discussed joint efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus, as well as humanitarian assistance to the residents of Syrian Idlib, the problem of migrants, the situation in Libya and Turkey's relations with the EU.
2445	11	Who is on what?
2445	13	Turkish President Erdogan stands firm in his position. Turkey will comply with the agreement on the containment of migrants only if Europe assumes part of the responsibility for resolving the situation. There are already 4.5 million refugees living in Turkey now. In addition, Turkey's borders opened since the end of February did not help thousands of refugees to cross the EU border in the region of Greece.
2445	15	"“Greece didn’t let anyone cross the border. People were met with tear gas and water cannons, and as a result, more than 10 thousand of them are now sitting in tents on a strip of no-man’s land several kilometers near the Pazarkule border post. Ankara is pushing them forward. But Athens does not need them "", - writes the French edition of Le Figaro."
2445	17	"The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Greece of violating international law and human rights. ""Greece is preventing the movement of refugees across its border, contrary to the 1951 Geneva Convention and EU law,"" the diplomatic mission said."
2445	19	Erdogan hopes to persuade the European Union to increase pressure in Idlib and support his project to build housing in northern Syria to resettle displaced people there.
2445	20	Where are you, mother? Syrian refugees sent from Germany back to Latvia
2445	21	Evacuation of a large migrant camp in Paris
2445	23	"The European Union, in turn, declared Turkey a blackmailer who uses migrants as a lever of political pressure on the European Union. Brussels is confident that Erdogan intends to ""attract migrants with open doors"" - not only those who fled the latest armed conflict in Idlib, but also migrants who lived in Turkey under the 2016 containment agreement."
2445	25	"""They (EU leaders - approx. Baltnews) do not like that he (Erdogan - approx. Baltnews) calls the Greeks ""Nazis"" and wages an information war with Athens. They remind that the granting of visas is due to a number of criteria that have not been met (observance rule of law and freedom of speech in Turkey)…"" writes Le Figaro."
2445	27	The past quadripartite summit has pushed for a slight détente in relations between Turkey and the European Union, in particular, in terms of humanitarian assistance to refugees from Idlib and the observance of a ceasefire, Le Figaro reports. However, now each of the parties will wait for the initiative from the partner.
2445	29	“An agreement at a meeting of the European Council on March 26 is possible only if Ankara stops the exodus of people it has begun. <…> With all this, the EU needs to improve the measures taken to settle refugees,” expert Mark Pierini cites Le Figaro.
2445	31	Controversial migration treaty
2445	33	On February 29, Turkey opened its western border to refugees. With this decision, Turkey violated the agreement with the European Union on the control of the movements of migrants, concluded in 2016. The Turkish authorities explained that they were not able to cope with the Syrian refugees on their own.
2445	35	"Turkish President Erdogan blamed Europe for the incident. He said that he was forced to ""remove the locks from the doors"" by European countries that did not comply with the terms of the agreement."

2445	37	A migrant wearing a mask at the Turkish border crossing point of Pazarkul, Greece, March 5, 2020
2445	39	The joint plan to combat the migration crisis meant that the European Union undertook to help Turkey with financing, return to Turkey all refugees caught on the Greek border, and also accept legal migrants from Syria on a one-for-one basis.
2446	3	"The head of the public relations department of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, Borukh Gorin, condemned actor Yegor Beroev for comparing covid restrictions in Moscow with the Holocaust. He appreciated the words of the artist in an interview with the publication ""Rise""."
2446	5	"Gorin stated that comparing the ban on visiting crowded places with the Warsaw Ghetto ""does not indicate high intellectuality."" “And it’s bad taste to stick a golden six-pointed star without realizing that this is a vulgarization of a catastrophe, genocide, the murder of children,” the source added. He also noted that Beroev exposed himself to reproach and ridicule, and his words are ""a sign of a neglected state of moral and ethical feelings."""
2446	7	"On Tuesday, June 22, Russian actor Yegor Beroev made a statement about coronavirus restrictions at the TEFI - Chronicle of Victory award ceremony. He took the stage in a jacket with a large yellow star, similar to those that the Nazis forced Jews to wear in German-controlled territories during the Holocaust. The artist urged ""to prevent the segregation of society into smart and stupid, Jews and non-Jews, vaccinated and unvaccinated."" Beroev also announced that he had not been vaccinated and wondered why the “descendants of the victors” allowed the covid bans."
2447	2	Ambassador of Ukraine Melnyk: German authorities do not provide proper hospitality to refugees, so Ukrainians leave
2447	4	The German authorities do not provide proper hospitality to Ukrainian refugees, said Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk.
2447	6	The Bild newspaper writes about another criticism of the German authorities by the Ukrainian ambassador. In an interview with the publication, Melnik urged Berlin to think about why Ukrainians do not want to stay in Germany.
2447	8	Most return from Germany without receiving proper hospitality, Melnik said.
2447	10	"In addition, the ambassador spoke about the likely timing of Ukraine's entry into the European Union, stressing that it ""could take years."""
2447	12	We don't need a back door entrance, we need a fair process,” the ambassador summed up.
2447	14	"This is not the first time Melnik has criticized the German authorities for delaying arms supplies to Ukraine. In an interview with the German media group Funke, he was outraged that ""the promised 15 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns can be delivered at the earliest at the end of July, and another 15 only at the end of August."" Melnik noted that the FRG is able to supply the Armed Forces of Ukraine with at least 100 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and 88 Leopard-1 tanks."
2447	16	"The Ukrainian ambassador accused former Chancellor Angela Merkel of lacking self-criticism, and called her successor Olaf Scholz ""an offended liverwurst."""
2448	3	The events in Ukraine have plunged the world into an energy crisis. Since Russian troops began crossing the country's borders, oil prices have risen by more than a quarter. Gas prices have almost doubled. And the outlook for both markets is not promising; as Western countries use sanctions to limit Russia's ability to fund its operation with oil and gas revenues, energy prices are likely to remain high and volatile. Wartime uncertainty is consistent with fears about climate change, raising more worries about the future of global energy. Countries should have started moving away from fossil fuels decades ago to protect the planet. Now they must do so at a time when people are paying ever higher prices.
2448	5	As states seek to reduce high energy prices and reduce dependence on Russia while combating climate change, many are showing renewed interest in nuclear power. It's easy to see why. Nuclear power is already one of the world's largest sources of carbon-free energy, accounting for 25% of the European Union's electricity. Unlike most forms of renewable energy such as solar and wind, nuclear power can reliably produce large amounts of electricity every hour of the year. And it has already helped Europe move away from fossil fuels produced elsewhere in the world, including natural gas from Russia.
2448	7	But in the short term, Europe's growing reliance on nuclear power will not free the continent from Russian fuel. Just as Europe has become dependent on Russian oil and gas, much of the world has become dependent on Russia for the materials needed to produce nuclear power. Russia has nearly half the world's uranium enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel production, and 40% of the nuclear energy produced in Europe depends on uranium from Russia or Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, close allies of the Kremlin. Approximately half of all US nuclear power plants—about 10% of total US electricity generation—are powered by imports from these three countries (this fact may explain why the US nuclear industry has lobbied to remove uranium from sanctions on energy imports from Russia).
2448	9	Russia also dominates the market for the export and construction of nuclear power plants, especially in emerging economies. Its closest competitor is China, another autocracy. States that enter into contracts with China or Russia can depend on them for decades for nuclear fuel and services.
2449	3	The Western world continues to be in a situation where reality is daily waging a fierce and stubborn battle with the world of fabulous fantasies. UN Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking at the Austrian World Summit (this is an annual climate conference in Vienna), said that the policy of investing in the exploration and production of fossil fuels is unacceptable and absurd.
2449	4	It should be noted that this is not the first such attack by Guterres in the direction of states desperately trying to keep afloat the increasingly hesitant world and national economies.
2449	6	In May, the Secretary General, discussing the results of the UN annual report on climate change, lashed out at all countries that are either increasing their consumption of natural gas, oil and coal, or postponing the so-called green transition until better times. Guterres lamented that states that officially set themselves the goal of complete decarbonization by 2050, instead of allocating four trillion dollars annually for the production of alternative energy sources, prefer to keep hydrocarbons in the energy base and balance position for much less money. Such a policy, according to the head of the organization, is a dead end from which there is no way out, and there is no need to talk about the fight against global warming.
2449	8	In March, Mr. Secretary General made a no less odious speech in which he called investments in the extraction and consumption of coal a dangerous folly.
2449	9	These words were sounded at the height of the anti-Russian hysteria, when, in the wake of regular sanctions, Western countries rushed headlong to look for alternative energy suppliers. True, it quickly became clear that it is one thing to want and quite another to be able. There is virtually nothing to replace coal from Russia, the world's third largest exporter. Australia, which occupies the first place in the sale of its black gold, is physically unable to close the market hole that has formed, moreover, production there has fallen significantly after China introduced a complete ban on the import of Australian coal. Indonesia did not help either. When in December it became clear that the country had critically low (virtually zero) coal reserves at power plants, Jakarta, without further ado, introduced a total ban on exports. Later it was removed, but the volume of deliveries did not even come close to the figures of the previous year.
2449	11	Guterres was so upset at the time that he called the world's leading economies lunatics on their way to a climate catastrophe.
2449	13	Here we will probably for the first time stand up for the leaders of Western countries.
2449	14	It is easy to speak and denounce the UN Secretary General, an organization that does not earn a single cent, but exists solely on the generous donations of the world community and no less generously spends this (other people's) money at its own discretion. The world economy, which, after a sudden Covid uppercut (to use sports terminology), went into a deep knockdown, with the start of a special military operation in Ukraine and the sanctions war against Russia, finally collapsed into the ring already in a knockout.
245	3	Putin's Russia today is like Nazi Germany 80 years ago, and Putin is the same as Hitler.
245	5	It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to a video message from Petro Poroshenko on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation.
245	7	Poroshenko also stressed that the world should have restrained the Russian Fuhrer even when he only gave the first hints of his revanchist plans.
245	9	"Never again should the horrors of the Second World War, the destruction of innocent people, the destruction of the very foundations of civilization, be repeated. Never again"" was heard again and again. Already after the attack on Georgia, after the capture of the Crimea, after the aggression in the east of our state. But the repetition of words could not replace actions in defense of peace. For more than one year, the creeping appeasement of the aggressor, who on ""Never again"" answered - ""we can repeat,"" Poroshenko said."
245	11	Now Russian aggression has spread to the entire territory of Ukraine, he adds.
245	13	Once again the aggressor denies our right to exist, declares its right to reshape borders by force. And we, Ukrainians, are taking away the right to life. At the same time, he uses all the tools of Nazism: the bombing of cities and villages, the genocide of civilians, total lies in the media,” Poroshenko said.
245	15	"Poroshenko notes that the destruction of educational institutions, libraries and museums was copied from Hitler's ""OST"" plan, which provided for the transformation of Ukraine into a source of raw materials and slave labor. And the export from the occupied territories is a repetition of the Holodomor."
245	17	Today, as in the days of World War II, we are at the forefront. Today the free world is again in mortal danger. The irresistible evil will not stop in Ukraine. This is very well understood by the peoples who made a decisive contribution to the victory in World War II. It is these peoples and governments who now support us and continue to develop support for Ukraine, have already formalized a powerful anti-Putin coalition. Arms, sanctions, opposition to Russian propaganda, humanitarian aid, shelter for refugees, strengthening the unity of NATO and the EU - these are no longer slogans, these are concrete actions. We defeated Nazism and fascism - we will also defeat rashism, - he sums up.
2450	1	Andrey Soyustov: Authors of Russophobic agitation became European trendsetters
2450	3	"Russia should continue to pursue the goals of a special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine. The destruction of the neo-Nazi regime on its territory will be Moscow's most effective response to the Russophobic insinuations of the West. A typical example of such insinuations is the article by the British historian Neil Ferguson ""The Seven Worst Scenarios for a War in Ukraine""."
2450	5	Epidemic of Russophobia
2450	7	"The longer the special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine continues, the higher the degree of the Russophobia epidemic observed in the West becomes. Which, in general, is quite understandable. For many in the West, it was a real shock to realize that after the collapse of the USSR, Russia not only “rose from its knees”, but also dared to defend its national interests by force. The presence of strategic nuclear forces in the Russian Federation deprived Moscow's opponents of the opportunity to deal with the ""rebel"" according to the Yugoslav scenario. The consequence of this impotence was the inflating of Russophobia abroad as a European mainstream. Those who had a positive or at least neutral attitude towards Russia were ostracized in Europe or simply relegated to the background. The European trendsetters turned out to be those who were emphatically negative about the Russian Federation."
2450	9	"One of the brightest representatives of this cohort of public opinion leaders can be considered the famous British historian, writer and journalist Neil Ferguson. To be honest, as a serious scientist, Ferguson has not proven himself very much. For example, Russian sociologist Alexander Tarasov called Ferguson a falsifier of history, and Nobel laureate in economics Paul Krugman characterized the Briton as follows: “He is a poseur ... when it comes to economics, he does not bother to understand the basics, relying on sarcastic comments and a superficial mind to convey an impression of wisdom."""
2450	11	Nevertheless, it is this “falsifier and poseur” who is now actively commenting on the events of the Ukrainian crisis in the Western media, thereby imposing his views on the European public. In particular, recently Ferguson published an article in Bloomberg under a very eloquent title: “The Seven Worst Scenarios for a War in Ukraine.”
2450	13	I think it will be interesting for the domestic reader to get acquainted with the conclusions of Mr. Ferguson, since they are also characteristic of other Western leaders of public opinion.
2450	15	"""Pulling an Owl on a Globe"""
2450	17	"Speaking about current events in Ukraine, Ferguson is trying to draw parallels with the events of the German-Polish war of 1939, which, in fact, from a historical point of view, looks like a frank “pulling an owl on the globe.” However, such ""little things"" of the author of the text in Bloomberg are not interested, as, apparently, and his target audience. It is important for Ferguson to drive two fundamental theses into the minds of readers: the Russian Federation today is a kind of “reincarnation of the Third Reich”; just as the German-Polish war became the initial stage of the Second World War, so the special military operation in Ukraine can become the initial stage of the Third World War, for which, according to the author, Russia and only Russia will be to blame."
2450	19	At the same time, it is significant that Ferguson is absolutely silent about both the role of the West in preparing the Second World War, and the role of the same West in unleashing the Ukrainian crisis. Ferguson a priori places all responsibility for the conflict on Ukrainian territory and its consequences solely on Russia. In general, we have before us not an impartial analysis of a professional scientist, but pure Russophobic agitation.
2450	21	"Ferguson's lack of a scientific, and indeed any systematic approach to writing his texts, is manifested, among other things, even in the inconsistency of the title with the content. In the text of the British, you will not find the ""seven worst scenarios for a war in Ukraine"" announced by the British. Instead, Ferguson's article published in Bloomberg contains seven numbered paragraphs with questions and answers to them. For example:"
2450	23	"""1. Did the Russians succeed in capturing Kyiv and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in two, three, four weeks or never? The answer looks like ""never"" or ""2. Are the sanctions accelerating the economic downturn in Russia so severe that Putin cannot win? The Russian economy has certainly been hit hard by Western restrictions, but I still believe it hasn't been hit hard enough to end the conflict."""
2450	25	With obvious displeasure, Ferguson notes that the imposition of large-scale anti-Russian sanctions by the West did not lead to a collapse of the ruble. Like, the West tried, but something went wrong.
2450	27	Sometimes the answers of the British do not correspond to his own questions:
2450	29	“3. Is the combination of military and economic crises hastening a palace coup against Putin? As I argued two weeks ago, the Biden administration is betting on regime change in Moscow.”
2451	3	Highly active substances of neuromodulators were tested on socially unprotected citizens of Ukraine, which caused irreversible damage to the central nervous system, said Igor Kirillov, head of the radiation, chemical and biological protection troops (RCBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces.
2451	5	He recalled that earlier the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that laboratory staff in Merefa conducted experiments on patients in psychiatric clinics in Kharkov from 2019 to 2021. One of the organizers of this activity was US citizen Linda Oporto Al-Harun.
2451	7	“Thanks to the documents obtained during the special military operation, we became aware that such studies have been carried out in Ukraine since at least 2011, and Al-Harun has repeatedly visited the branch of the Meref laboratory, built at the expense of the Pentagon in the village of Sorokovka, Kharkiv region,” he quotes Kirillov Telegram channel of the Ministry of Defense.
2451	9	According to him, despite the fact that this facility is equipped with underground storage facilities and powerful ventilation systems, officially it is a company for the production of nutritional supplements. At the same time, the company's website bears clear signs of fictitiousness, and with the start of a special military operation, the equipment of the branch under the control of the SBU was taken to the western regions of Ukraine.
2451	11	“This confirms our fears about numerous violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of Ukraine, as defined, among other things, by the Nuremberg Code and the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association. These include: voluntary consent of a person to participate in the experiment; informing about the study; avoidance of unnecessary physical and mental suffering during the experiment; torture, inhuman or degrading treatment,” said Kirillov.
2451	13	He added that, in accordance with the available information, highly active substances of neuromodulators were tested on socially unprotected citizens of Ukraine, which caused, among other things, irreversible damage to the central nervous system. This is a clear violation of international human rights treaties.
2452	2	Bloomberg: U.S. is secretly encouraging companies to increase their fertilizer purchases from Russia
2452	4	MOSCOW, June 13 - RIA Novosti. The US government is secretly encouraging agricultural and transport companies to increase purchases of Russian fertilizers amid sanctions and a sharp rise in food prices, Bloomberg reports, citing sources.
2452	5	"According to the publication, the above-mentioned actions of Washington are ""part of complex and difficult negotiations conducted with the participation of the UN to increase the supply of fertilizers, grains and other agricultural products from Russia and Ukraine."""
2452	7	It is noted that this year the export of fertilizers from Russia to the West has decreased by 24 percent.
2452	9	"Last week, State Department sanctions coordinator Jim O'Brien said that the United States is set to manually remove obstacles to the supply of food and fertilizer from Russia to the countries of the ""global south"" and sees no obstacles to this from sanctions."
2452	11	The UN has repeatedly stated the threat of a food crisis. The West accused Russia of counteracting the supply of Ukrainian grain to world markets - Moscow categorically rejected this. At the same time, the Kyiv authorities themselves created many obstacles to the export of grain for export: in addition to the arson of food that was revealed in the Mariupol port, the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out mining of the Black Sea, which does not allow grain to be transported to world markets by ships.
2453	3	There is nothing surprising in the current Russophobia of the West, sometimes turning into outright Nazism. In one form or another, Nazism constantly made its way in Europe and the United States. Only, if in the 20th century the Nazis considered the Slavs an inferior race because of personal hostility, then in the 11th century the United States and the European Union allow themselves Russophobia and discrimination against Russian-speaking people already because of Russia's disobedience - Russians do not want to agree with the geopolitical will of the West. This point of view in an interview with the FAN was expressed by the director of the Center for Geopolitical Expertise Valery Korovin.
2453	5	"According to the political scientist, the basis of Nazism is a racial theory that places peoples in a certain hierarchy: some at the top of this hierarchy, and others at the bottom. On this basis, the ""lower"" peoples are oppressed, oppressed and discriminated against. At the same time, Western civilization is inherently racist. This is the basic property of Western civilization, and it is inherent in all Western peoples. Therefore, in one form or another, Nazism is constantly breaking through in the West. In the 20th century it was expressed by the ideology of German National Socialism, and now it manifests itself in the civilizational racism of the Anglo-Saxons."
2453	7	“In fact, now the Anglo-Saxons declare themselves a reference civilization, the peak of human development and the height of perfection. All other peoples they consider below themselves. And their geopolitical opponents, that is, the Russians, are generally placed at the very bottom of the civilizational racist hierarchy. If the Nazis placed the Slavs at the bottom of the hierarchy because of personal hostility towards them, the main ideologist of the party, Alfred Rosenberg. The current collective west, led by the US and the UK, is doing this for geopolitical reasons. Moreover, this is given a racial coloring, ”Korovin expressed his opinion.
2453	9	As the political scientist explained, the Russians are “subhuman” for the collective West, because they do not agree with the geopolitical will of the United States. America and Western countries brought the same racism to Ukraine by imposing an artificial construction. On the territory of Ukraine, they declared the supremacy of Ukrainians, and placed national minorities down.
2453	11	“This approach is generally consistent with the Western arrogant worldview. It has always been and always will be. As long as the West claims to dominate the world and Europe, racism, racial theories and Nazism will dominate its politics. And this will be a problem for all the peoples of the world,” Korovin concluded.
2454	2	Foreign Policy: Germany does not want to humiliate Russia and conducts secret negotiations with it on Ukraine
2454	4	"MOSCOW, June 20 - RIA Novosti. Germany opposes the ""humiliation"" of Russia and is ready to neglect assistance to Ukraine for this, Peter Raf, an expert at the Hudson Institute in Washington, wrote in an article for Foreign Policy magazine."
2454	5	"In his opinion, this is evidenced by the ""secret negotiations"" that Berlin is allegedly conducting with Moscow."
2454	6	The fact that Berlin is awash with rumors of secret negotiations with Russia suggests that Germany would rather disappoint Ukraine than humiliate Russia, whatever that means, Raf said.
2454	7	The analyst believes that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz probably shares the position of French President Emmanuel Macron on a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
2454	9	"Of course, Scholz did not go as far as Macron, who suggested that Ukraine give up part of the territory and warned the West against humiliating ""Russia. However, the German reaction to the escalation in the form of building diplomatic interchanges speaks for itself,"" the expert noted."
2454	10	Raf drew attention to the insignificance of military assistance that Berlin provides to Kyiv.
2457	3	"Vladimir Ilyichev said that Russia ""is not going to close itself off from the world and break traditional ties"""
2457	5	GENEVA, 12 June. /Corr. TASS Konstantin Pribytkov/. Russia, which is a major world food exporter, does not intend to leave this market. This was stated in an interview with TASS by Deputy Minister of Economic Development Vladimir Ilyichev, who heads the Russian delegation at the 12th ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that opened on Sunday in Geneva.
2457	6	Causes of the food crisis
2457	8	We, as a major supplier of food on the world market, intend to continue to remain on it, to supply our products to partners, our traditional consumers, and we are ready to take all the actions available to us for this, as we have repeatedly stated. But in order for the system to work, it is necessary that all participants in the process strive for results, - said the head of the delegation.
2457	10	"The topic of food supplies will be discussed at the current WTO conference. However, views on the causes of the food crisis ""differ significantly,"" Ilyichev continued. Russia proceeds from the fact that the reasons for the rise in food prices on the world market ""are largely related to inflation, which was caused by the injection of money not backed by goods to eliminate the consequences of the pandemic in developed countries."" “Even last year, there were big problems with the level of prices for wheat and some other goods. This, of course, is also connected with the destruction of supply chains during the pandemic, but now, unfortunately, this has been superimposed by an essentially sanctions war,” the deputy minister continued. - When they try to blame us for the food crisis and its possible intensification in the foreseeable future, we say: ""Gentlemen, first, eliminate the consequences that you artificially create yourself by breaking supply chains, preventing grain from being transported and food transport insurance to be carried out."""
2457	12	"We do not really expect that some solution [of the food problem] will be found at the WTO site,” the agency’s interlocutor noted. He drew attention to the fact that at the time of the discussion of this issue at a number of other international platforms, the European Union adopted the sixth package of sanctions against Russia, and one of the largest banks in the country, Rosselkhozbank, was disconnected from the SWIFT system. ""How then should food supplies be carried out at all, if it becomes extremely difficult to pay for it,"" the head of the delegation said."
2457	14	Anti-Russian sanctions
2457	16	"According to the deputy minister, the topic of anti-Russian sanctions ""obviously will be discussed in different formats"" at the current WTO conference. At the same time, representatives of Western countries, apparently, will again try at the forum to present the problems that have arisen on world markets as a consequence of Russia's actions. ""We do not agree with this. We are trying to calmly explain that we intend to continue participating in the international trade system,"" Ilyichev explained. Russia ""is not going to shut itself off from the world and break traditional ties."" Moscow still sees ""an advantage in participating in international trade and the division of labor."""
2457	18	"Answering the question whether Western countries should be expected to try to use the WTO platform to impose, as they do in other international organizations, a politicized discussion about events in Ukraine, Ilyichev said: “Yes, we proceed from the fact that [they] will make exactly the same speeches that they have been making in recent months, but in our opinion, now it is necessary to agree on a return to the normal application of the rules of trade. The sanctions policy of the states included by Russia in the list of unfriendly, in fact, destroys this system, the Deputy Minister stated. Moscow believes that ""it is necessary to discuss how to preserve this system, because no one will benefit from the breakup of the world into blocs."""
2458	2	Senator Pushkov called Nord Stream 2 the biggest failure of Merkel
2458	4	MOSCOW, June 13 - RIA Novosti. The suspension of the certification of Nord Stream 2 was due to the fault of the Ukrainian policy of the ex-Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany Angela Merkel, and this was its biggest failure, Senator Alexei Pushkov said on Telegram.
2458	5	The parliamentarian recalled that the former head of the German government supported the violent change of power in Kyiv, and was also a supporter of the Western path of development of Ukraine.
2458	6	"As a result, Merkel's brainchild, Nord Stream 2, which she was convinced of the necessity and usefulness for Germany, became a victim of her own policy of encouraging aggressive forces in Kyiv. This was probably her biggest failure - in terms of genuine, and not far-fetched interests of Germany,"" Pushkov wrote."
2458	7	According to Pushkov, Merkel is also directly responsible for the current events in Ukraine.
2458	9	After the start of the Russian special operation to liberate Donbass, the West stepped up sanctions pressure on Moscow. Some countries announced the freezing of Russian assets, many brands left the country. The European Union has already adopted six packages of sanctions, which, in particular, provide for the gradual introduction of an embargo on the import of coal and oil.
2458	11	The Kremlin called what is happening an economic war, the likes of which have not yet been. As Vladimir Putin stated, the policy of containment and weakening of Russia is a long-term strategy of the West, and the sanctions dealt a serious blow to the entire world economy. According to him, the main goal of the United States and Europe is to worsen the lives of millions of people.
246	1	"Are you saying ""never again""? Tell Ukraine about it: Zelensky recorded an appeal from Borodyanka"
246	3	President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the Ukrainians on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. The head of state recorded his appeal from the ruined Borodyanka, in the Kyiv region.
246	5	It is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the Office of the President.
246	7	"This year we say never again"" differently. We hear ""never again"" differently. It sounds painful, tough. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. Do you say ""never again""? Tell Ukraine about it. On February 24, the word never was erased, shot and bombed. Hundreds of rockets at 4 in the morning, which woke up the whole of Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard again,"" Zelensky said."
246	9	"The President noted that after 77 years since the end of the Second World War, ""evil has revived."""
246	11	"Unfortunately, there are those who survived all these crimes, having lost millions of people who fought for victory and won it, today desecrated the memory of their exploits. The one who allowed shelling the cities of Ukraine from his land. The one who spat in the face of his Immortal Regiment, ""putting executioners from Bucha next to him and challenged all of humanity, but forgot the main thing: everyone ends the same way - it ends,"" the guarantor added."
246	13	Zelensky called on Ukrainians today to honor the memory of all the fighters against Nazism and the victims who died during World War II.
246	15	Recall that today, May 8, Ukraine celebrates the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation.
2460	1	The highest gasoline prices are in a country sitting on an oil and gas needle
2460	3	The cost of automotive fuel is without a doubt one of the most hotly debated topics in any society on any side of the ocean. Western media suddenly published data that, in theory, should reassure the European and American society. The most expensive motor gasoline in the Western Hemisphere is reportedly sold in Norway.
2460	4	A liter of local fuel costs 27 crowns, which is 155 rubles at the current exchange rate.
2460	6	Fun fact: the initial publications on this topic were widely distributed in the American segment. Apparently, in this way, overseas publications are trying to save the uncontrollably diving rating of the incumbent president. Americans, the most automobile nation on the planet, are now forced to buy gasoline at five or six dollars a gallon, which is one and a half times higher than at the beginning of the year. Judging by the fact that Joe Biden is currently supported by only 39 percent of American citizens, and 47 percent are categorically dissatisfied with the results of his work, it is becoming increasingly difficult to write off the growing figures of fuel costs as the machinations of Vladimir Putin.
2460	8	However, let's leave the issues of politics to specialized specialists and talk about the ambiguity of perception of long-familiar paradigms and some deeply rooted myths.
2460	9	Norway, like other Scandinavian countries, in the mass consciousness of our fellow citizens from the time when the Internet was not yet invented, and all the news and gossip was transmitted orally in the kitchens, is covered with an almost fabulous halo. Here is a fantastic (the most progressive) system of school education, which at the same time cannot even boast of winners of international Olympiads, and roads that have not required repairs for decades and do not know holes and potholes, and much more. One of the most enduring myths: all the inhabitants of the Western world - and the Scandinavian countries in particular - are very wealthy people.
2460	10	Do not rush to close the page, today no one is going to destroy this confidence.
2460	11	In relation to Norway, one can really say that this is a very rich country with a high standard of living, however, there is one thing here that will not particularly appeal to all those who are used to feeling sorry for themselves because fate threw him into a country that is sitting on a raw material needle.
2460	13	The fact is that the welfare of Norway is entirely based on the production and export of oil and its products. According to the results of last year, this northern country produced two million barrels of oil per day, which seems to be a little compared to, for example, Saudi Arabia or Russia, where 10.5 million barrels are extracted daily. If we take only general figures, then Norway closes the top ten oil-producing countries, yielding even to Brazil. But, as we have already said, it is completely wrong to operate only with general production figures here, the picture must be looked at in a complex way.
2460	14	The population of Norway is a modest five million people, which is equal to the number of inhabitants of the Krasnodar Territory. Accordingly, if we compare the population of our countries, then there will be almost thirty times fewer Norwegians than Russians. As it is easy to calculate, per capita in Norway there are six times more income from the sale of hydrocarbons.
2460	15	The fact that these are not malicious conjectures of envious people is also confirmed by official statistics.
2460	16	The profit from oil exports alone in Norway is about five percent of the gross domestic product, although in the rest of the world this figure is on average 2.7 percent.
2460	17	Also keep in mind the fact that 60 percent of all Norwegian exports are natural gas and the already mentioned crude oil. Norway in terms of blue fuel exports is second only to Russia and Qatar, firmly occupying the third line in the global supplier table.
2460	19	For understanding: every fourth cubic meter of gas burned in the European Union and the UK for the production of electricity, heat and other needs is of Norwegian origin.
2460	20	Again, for clarity of comparison, we add that over the three months of the special military operation, Russia earned about $ 90 billion from the sale of natural gas and oil, while Norway over the same period, taking advantage of the raging Russophobia, put 35 billion in its pocket.
2460	21	Only three times less with, we recall, a thirty-fold smaller population and an incomparably smaller area of ​​\u200b\u200bterritory, the length of borders, the number of remote settlements where food and fuel need to be delivered, and many other items for which budget money is spent.
2462	2	Expert Evseev: NATO attempts to capture Kaliningrad will force Russia to use nuclear weapons
2462	4	MOSCOW, June 20 - RIA Novosti. Hypothetical attempts by NATO to invade the Kaliningrad region could provoke Russia to use nuclear weapons, Vladimir Yevseev, a military expert at the Institute of CIS Countries, suggested in an interview with Ukraina.ru.
2462	5	According to him, the likelihood of an armed conflict in the Baltic is not very high, but it exists.
2462	7	I do not rule out that at some point Poland will aggravate the situation on the border with the Kaliningrad region. But one must understand that if Russia has even the slightest doubt that Kaliningrad will be captured by NATO countries, then Russia will use nuclear weapons and create a land corridor through the territory of Lithuania. If the West is ready for this, then let it aggravate the situation,” Evseev said.
2462	8	The analyst believes that the effectiveness of the military special operation in Ukraine will lead to the fact that the desire of the North Atlantic Alliance to engage in hostilities with the Russian army will weaken.
2462	10	Russia has been conducting a military operation in Ukraine since February 24. According to the Ministry of Defense, the Russian army has already completed the main tasks of the first stage - it has significantly reduced the combat potential of Ukraine. The main goal in the department was called the liberation of Donbass.
2463	1	"Surrendered military battalion ""Aidar"" began to testify against colleagues"
2463	2	Surrendered soldiers of the Aidar battalion testify against their colleagues
2463	4	Servicemen of the Ukrainian Aidar battalion, who had previously surrendered to the soldiers of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), began to testify against their colleagues, who are currently blocking the Azot plant in Severodonetsk, a source close to the People's Militia of the LPR told TASS.
2463	6	“Now information received from the Aidarovites who surrendered in Metelkino is being used for negotiations with the militants,” he said.
2463	8	Volodymyr Dzhabarov, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, emphasized that when representatives of the elite units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) begin to surrender, it can be concluded that the morale of the Ukrainian army is significantly reduced due to the successes of the Russian army and the forces of the DPR and LPR.
2464	3	Analyst Evseev said that NATO's attempt to capture Kaliningrad would force the Russian Federation to launch a nuclear strike
2464	5	Military analyst of the Institute of CIS Countries Volodymyr Yevseev, in an interview with Ukraina.ru, admitted the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in provocation of NATO. He stated that a hypothetical attempt to seize the Kaliningrad region would force Moscow to strike.
2464	7	He noted that the likelihood of an armed conflict on the coast of the Baltic Sea is small, but it exists, since Poland at some point may begin to aggravate the situation on the border.
2464	9	“But one must understand that if Russia has even the slightest doubt that Kaliningrad will be captured by NATO countries, then Russia will use nuclear weapons and create a land corridor through the territory of Lithuania. If the West is ready for this, then let it aggravate the situation,” Evseev stressed.
2464	11	According to a military expert, the effective conduct of a special operation in Ukraine will weaken the desire of the North Atlantic Alliance to enter into a confrontation with Moscow.
2465	3	Journalist Zygar in an article for Der Spiegel called international support for Ukraine an illusion
2465	5	Russian journalist and writer, former editor of the Dozhd TV channel (included by the Ministry of Justice in the register of media outlets acting as foreign agents) Mikhail Zygar called international support for Ukraine an illusion. He spoke about this in an article for Der Spiegel.
2465	7	According to the journalist, he recently spoke with a high-ranking Ukrainian diplomat who represents his country in one of the most important international organizations. “My interlocutor was very depressed. He said that unequivocal international support for Ukraine is an illusion, ”he said.
2465	9	Zygar stressed that the lively political gestures of European leaders, especially in the first months of the Russian special operation, created the impression that the whole world was rallying around Ukraine and condemning Moscow's actions. “However, it is clear to diplomats that this is by no means the case,” he stressed.
2465	11	"According to the journalist, the special operation in Ukraine made the split of the world even more obvious. Thus began the Cold War - a new division of the world into two camps, ""one of which is anti-American, anti-Western and anti-liberal."""
2465	13	"Forbes previously said Western public financial support for Ukraine had fallen to ""disappointing"" levels in just four months. It is noted that in the early days of the special operation, people sought to support Ukraine, but now their focus is on more pressing issues."
2466	1	Australia sends first M113AS4 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine
2466	3	Australian Ministry of Defense: the country sent Ukraine the first four armored personnel carriers M113AS4
2466	5	MOSCOW, June 20 - RIA Novosti. Australia sent the first four M113AS4 armored personnel carriers out of 14 to Ukraine, according to the Australian Ministry of Defense.
2466	6	The first four M113AS4 armored personnel carriers transferred to Ukraine left the Royal Air Force base in Amberley last week. Loaded onto a Ukrainian An-124 aircraft, the four vehicles are the first of 14 M113AS4 armored personnel carriers to be provided by Australia, according to a statement on the ministry's website.
2466	7	It is noted that the package of Australian assistance to Ukraine includes support worth more than 285 million Australian dollars (about 198 million US dollars), it included Bushmaster armored personnel carriers, M777 howitzers, anti-tank weapons, ammunition, unmanned aerial vehicles and personal equipment.
2466	9	"Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. President Vladimir Putin called its goal ""the protection of people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years."" For this, according to him, it is planned to carry out ""demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine"", to bring to justice all war criminals responsible for ""bloody crimes against civilians"" in Donbass."
2467	1	"Vice-Chancellor of Germany spoke about the gas ""arm wrestling"" with Russia"
2467	3	Vice Chancellor Habek: Decrease in Russian gas supplies makes the situation in Germany tense
2467	5	"MOSCOW, June 20 - RIA Novosti. Germany's energy situation remains ""serious and tense"" amid declining gas supplies from Russia, German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said on the air of the ZDF TV channel."
2467	6	"The Minister of Economy of Germany compared what is happening with ""arm wrestling"" with Moscow."
2467	7	"It's a kind of arm wrestling. In the past, Russia had a longer hand at first,"" but this does not mean that we cannot get a ""stronger hand"" through the efforts made,"" Khabek said."
2467	8	"According to him, now the gas storages are 57 percent full, while the required 90 percent. He proposes to achieve the goals set by the winter by buying blue fuel and ""frugality""."
2467	10	Not too bad for this time of year, but it's not enough, and we need to fill them over the summer, the Vice Chancellor specified.
2467	12	"Earlier, Gazprom announced that due to restrictions at the Portovaya compressor station, it will be able to supply gas through the Nord Stream in the amount of up to 100 million cubic meters per day, against the planned 167 million. The reason was the delay in the work of Siemens, which was unable to return the gas pumping units from repair in time. The German concern confirmed this information: the turbine was repaired ""for technical reasons"" at the Siemens Energy plant in Montreal and cannot be returned due to Canada's sanctions against Russia."
2467	13	Germany, like other Western countries, faced rising energy prices and a surge in inflation due to the imposition of sanctions against Russia after the start of military operations in Ukraine. At the same time, Berlin, according to its leading politicians, is trying to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.
2467	14	Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov has repeatedly noted that Moscow has never used gas supplies to punish anyone, but sells fuel solely in its own interests, to increase the welfare of Russians, and on a commercial basis.
2468	1	Projects to help Donbass received support for 244 million rubles
2468	3	The Presidential Grants Fund supported projects to help Donbass for 244 million rubles
2468	5	MOSCOW, June 20 - RIA Novosti. The Presidential Grants Fund has supported 91 Russian projects to help Donbass worth 244 million rubles, Anton Dolgov, executive director of the fund, told RIA Novosti.
2468	6	A decision was made to support 91 projects that received the highest ratings from independent experts. The total amount of grants for these projects will amount to 244 million (roubles), Dolgov said.
2468	8	Applications for the last competition of the fund were accepted from February 1 to March 15. According to Dolgov, among the applications, at least 350 initiatives were related to assistance to citizens from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.
2468	10	This is at least 3% of the total number of submitted projects. Social activists requested 847 million rubles for the implementation of their initiatives,” he added.
2468	11	The projects concerned the reception and adaptation of refugees, humanitarian aid, medical support, including psychological support.
2468	12	In February of this year, from the beginning of the evacuation of civilians from the DPR and LPR to Russia, new challenges arose, and non-profit organizations immediately began to respond to them, as it was during the pandemic, - said the Executive Director of the Fund.
2468	14	In addition, he said that there were projects to assist the residents of Donbass before.
2468	15	The events in Donbas did not start yesterday. It is important to understand that the very essence of the work of NGOs is a lively reaction of living people to the needs of those who need help. Therefore, projects related to the support of the residents of Donbass have existed before, Dolgov said.
2468	16	"He cited as an example the project ""To live! To war and death in spite of"" the charity organization ""Fair Help of Doctor Lisa"", which received support from the Foundation in 2021."
2468	17	Then the project team processed 824 appeals from Donbass residents with requests for specialized medical care. 100 people underwent planned medical examinations, 70 children underwent elective surgeries, another 40 people received life-saving medicines, Dolgov noted.
2468	19	"Also, according to him, in the last competition, the number of ""quality projects has greatly increased"" compared to previous years."
2468	20	The Coordinating Committee was forced to decide to increase the level of passing scores in order to keep within the funds that were at the disposal of the fund. Not all good projects received support, but the best of the best,” he said.
2470	3	Daily Mail readers ridiculed the meeting between Zelensky and Ben Stiller

2470	6	The Daily Mail published photos and videos of Stiller and Zelensky's greeting.
2470	8	Just another reason to take a photo,” wrote one commenter on the DM site.
2470	10	Exactly. Now Ben Stiller will save the day. Everything you need to know about Zelensky. He is not a leader, but an actor. He surrounds himself with clearly the wrong people during a crisis,” added another.
2470	11	I see two comedians playing their roles in front of the lens, — said the user.
2470	12	The narcissism of these people is amazing. All this is PR and advertising, - they concluded in response.
2470	13	"Earlier, American actress Angelina Jolie, who is a special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Lviv as part of a ""personal"" visit to the region. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, noted that Jolie's visit to Ukraine was organized in order to divert attention from the Azovstal tragedy in Mariupol."

2471	13	Chernomorneftegaz
2471	14	Ukraine on Monday morning delivered three strikes on three Chernomorneftegaz drilling platforms installed at the Odesa field. According to Crimean senator Olga Kovitidi, platform BK-1 suffered the most; there were no casualties on platforms BK-2 and BK-3; five people were evacuated, three of them were injured, seven more are being searched.
2471	15	The entire territory of Crimea is covered. From the point of view of air defense, the entire land part of the peninsula is covered as much as possible, including the Crimean bridge. Nothing threatens anyone here,” Aksyonov said on the air of the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
2471	16	Shelling of Donetsk

2471	18	On Monday, at 2:05 pm Moscow time, Ukrainian troops fired six 155-millimeter shells at the Petrovsky district of Donetsk, the DPR representative office at the Joint Center for Control and Coordination of the ceasefire said.
2471	20	The intensity of shelling of Donetsk by Ukrainian troops has not decreased this week, the city continues to be actively bombed, said Mayor Alexei Kulemzin.
2471	21	Russian investigators sent the first ten criminal cases on the crimes of the Kyiv regime against civilians to the prosecutor's offices of the DPR and LPR, RIA Novosti was told in the press service of the Investigative Committee of Russia.
2471	22	International agenda
2471	23	The UN is ready to expand its presence in Ukraine, said Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the organization's secretary general.
2471	24	"We are ready to further expand our presence, but we need the parties (to the conflict) to do their part, he said at the briefing. According to Dujarric, the UN receives information about the massive shelling of territories, both controlled by the Ukrainian government and not controlled by it. ""The UN calls on the parties to respect (international) law,"" he said."
2471	25	The option of involving the CSTO forces in a special operation in Ukraine was not considered, press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
2471	26	German Foreign Minister Annalena Burbock called for the opening of humanitarian corridors for refugees in eastern Ukraine.
2471	27	My urgent appeal is that humanitarian international law must be respected at all points in this war. This means, first of all, access to humanitarian supplies, to medicines, so that the people who are now captured in eastern Ukraine could get out. Humanitarian corridors are needed, and we will continue to work every day to support the International Committee of the Red Cross, Burbock said on the sidelines of the meeting of the EU Foreign Minister in Luxembourg.
2471	28	The German authorities are negotiating with Poland and Romania on the export of grain from Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock told reporters in Luxembourg.
2471	30	"The draft US defense budget provides for $450 million to support Ukraine in intelligence and security, according to a document published by the relevant committee of the House of Representatives. According to the document, the Pentagon chief is proposed to grant the authority ""to provide support in the field of intelligence and security to the government of Ukraine"", for this, in fiscal year 2023 (expiring October 1, 2023), it is proposed to allocate $ 450 million. This amount is $150 million more than previously requested by US President Joe Biden."
2471	31	US President Joe Biden accused Russia of a record increase in the number of refugees in the world, follows from a published statement by the head of the White House.
2471	32	As a result of Russia's war against Ukraine, we have recently reached a grim mark: according to the UN Refugee Agency, more than one hundred million people are now forcibly displaced, more than at any time in history. We have already shown by hosting more than 80,000 Afghans in our country over the past year and by committing ourselves to providing temporary shelter to tens of thousands of Ukrainians that we will continue to be an example,” Biden said.
2471	33	"Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov called the Americans captured in Ukraine ""soldiers of fortune"" who participated in attacks on the Russian military, and made it clear that they cannot count on the protection of the Geneva Convention. ""They are soldiers of fortune and participated in illegal activities on the territory of Ukraine. They participated in the shelling of our military. They threatened their lives and must be held accountable ... for the crimes they committed,"" Peskov said in an interview with MSNBC."
2471	34	The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, in his message to the European leaders, said that he would call on them at the upcoming summit on June 23-24 in Brussels to grant the status of an EU candidate to Ukraine and Moldova.
2472	3	Ukraine has huge debt obligations to external creditors
2472	5	The IMF strategy for “fragile and conflict-affected states” was released in March 2022 and will remain in effect until 2025.
2472	7	The summary of the paper states: “Instability and conflict are exacerbated by climate change, food insecurity, and gender inequality… The impacts of instability and conflict are critical and directly related to the IMF’s mandate… specific manifestations of instability and conflict”.
2472	9	The document determines that 42 countries belong to the NCG list, which is about 20% of the IMF members. The strategy was developed by a group of experts led by Frank Bosca; Prior to joining the IMF, he was Senior Director of the Fragility, Conflict and Violence Group at the World Bank. He is also a regular participant in the Davos Economic Forum.
2472	11	The document states that countries from the NCG group need to modernize the tax system and customs fees, restructure public administration, anti-corruption laws, manage debt assets, oversee the functions of regulatory authorities, and combat money laundering.
2472	13	There is nothing new here - all the same methods that the World Bank Group (WB) used in the 90s. to restructure the economies of developing countries.
2472	15	By the way, the work of the World Bank Conflict Group has already been criticized by independent think tanks. A key problem facing the Bank's analysis - and even the UN's analysis of conflict and instability - is the lack of conclusions about the effects of neoliberal economic policies on conflict and instability. It is these consequences, including rising inequality and poverty, and declining human development indicators, that are causing unrest in many countries.
2472	17	There are no answers in the WB analysis to the questions of how macroeconomic shocks, inequality and unemployment (all these are factors of instability) will be eliminated. How is the Bank transforming its financial incentive directives to support the development of the NCG countries?
2472	19	And the most interesting question concerns Ukraine: how the World Bank and the IMF are going to carry out their policy towards this country, where hundreds of thousands of refugees, tens of thousands of dead, destroyed infrastructure.
2472	21	If this is not a country affected by conflict, then what is?
2472	23	"However, it is interesting that neither the World Bank nor the IMF qualify Ukraine as an ""unstable and conflict-affected state."" In early March 2022, the Bank approved an additional $489 million loan to Ukraine and created a multi-donor trust fund. A week later, the Bank allocated another $200 million to Ukraine and promised to help put together a $3 billion support package for Ukraine in the coming months."
2472	25	Ukraine is classified by the World Bank as a middle income country. As such, it can only borrow from the Bank's lending arm in this area, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and not from concessional lending, the International Development Association (IDA). If Ukraine were included in the NCG list, it could have access to financing with favorable maturities, or would be transferred to the IDA group, receiving concessional lending and the right to debt relief.
2472	27	"However, classifying Ukraine as an IDA (low-income country) country will deter foreign investors. And, in order to maintain ""investor confidence"", the Ukrainian government goes out of its way to maintain its current status in relations with the WB/IMF."
2472	29	According to Eliot Dolin-Evans of Monash University (Australia), “the main problem with reclassifying Ukraine as a country in conflict is that it would be very problematic for international financial institutions and creditors, since Ukraine is one of the largest borrowers of IMF money and World Bank, and the country has huge debt obligations to countries and external creditors around the world. A proper classification of Ukraine could mean that lenders, the IMF and the World Bank would waive interest and fees on loans made to the country, with the demand for debt forgiveness becoming much more weighty if Ukraine were an NCG country. The IMF and international lenders … take into account the World Bank classification, and they too would need to consider Ukraine for debt relief or concessional lending if the Bank classified Ukraine as an NCG country.”
2472	31	"That is, the World Bank turns a blind eye to what is happening with Ukraine, it is interested in usurious schemes, including the return of debts with interest. The same additional World Bank loan was provided on the condition that the government of Ukraine ""reaffirm commitments to resume ... reforms after the end of the war."" Ukraine will continue to be credited at market rates, which will burden it with an even more unsustainable external debt."
2474	1	The ice is melting between us. In the United States, they figured out how to push Russia on the Northern Sea Route
2474	3	MOSCOW, June 21 - RIA Novosti, Nikolai Guryanov. Russia could lose control of the Northern Sea Route if the ice in the Arctic melts, US climate scientists and lawyers say. RIA Novosti examined the validity of their forecasts.
2474	4	The climate opens the way
2474	5	If global warming cannot be contained by 1.5 degrees in the next 43 years, then by 2065, new trade routes may appear in the ice-free Arctic. According to American scientists, this can weaken Russia's control over the region.
2474	7	The authors of the study, climatologists at Brown University in Rhode Island and a legal scholar at the University of Maine School of Law, note that Arctic trade routes are 30 to 50 percent shorter than those through the Suez and Panama Canals. Transit time will be reduced by about 14-20 days, shipping companies will not only save money, but will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 24 percent.
2474	8	Of greatest economic interest is the Northeast Passage, also known as the Northern Sea Route. It can connect the largest ports of the countries of Southeast Asia and Northern Europe, between which there is the main world cargo flow.
2474	10	The Northern Sea Route is called an alternative to the transportation of goods through the Suez Canal. But in fact, if widely used, it will compete with a longer route - bypassing Africa. This is how a significant part of the goods are delivered, for example, from Shanghai to Rotterdam.
2474	11	No ice - no laws
2474	12	The Northern Sea Route runs through the exclusive economic zone of Russia and is actually used by one country. The reason is not only the most powerful icebreaking fleet in the world, but also international laws that give the Arctic coastal states the right to control a ribbon 200 nautical miles wide from the coast. Now a foreign vessel cannot pass along the route without coordination with Russia, without pilotage or icebreaking escort.
2474	13	"American lawyers want to directly link the spread of Russian laws to this water area with the fact that there is ice there. One of the co-authors of the study, director of the University of Maine Center for Oceanic and Coastal Law and lawyer Charles Norci, cites article 234 of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The document states that in order to protect the environment from pollution, ""coastal states have the right to adopt and enforce <...> laws and regulations"" that regulate the movement of ships in areas where ""especially severe climatic conditions and the presence of ice covering such areas during most of the year, create obstacles or increased danger to navigation."
2474	14	The effect of the article extends to the exclusive economic zone - areas 200 nautical miles wide from the coast.
2474	16	According to Norcia, Russia has used this article for decades in its own economic and geopolitical interests. But if there is no ice cover in the Arctic regions for a significant part of the time, then the country will no longer be able to extend its laws to this territory. Although he will try, the American lawyer believes.
2474	17	Moreover, with the melting of ice, shipping will leave Russian territorial waters and enter international ones. Russia will not be able to prevent this, adds Norci.
2474	18	Ice, but not that
2474	19	However, with this article of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, everything is not as simple as a lawyer from the United States is trying to present. First of all, now there is no generally accepted delimitation of the Arctic spaces - there are several points of view at once on the delimitation and legal regime of the northernmost region of the planet.
2474	20	In the 1970s, the prevailing theory was that the Arctic was divided into five sectors between Russia, the US, Canada, Norway, and Denmark. At the same time, the sovereignty of states extended to the lands and islands located within the sector, the top of which was the North Pole.
2474	21	But such an approach practically excluded the possibility of applying to a large area of ​​the Arctic Ocean the provisions of Part VII of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which guarantees freedom of navigation, flight, fishing and other activities on the high seas outside the exclusive economic zones and territorial waters.
2474	23	A way out, albeit far from ideal, was proposed in Article 234, Vladislav Belyakov, an expert on the law of the sea, an associate partner of AB SPb Inmarine, tells RIA Novosti.
2474	24	"The document does not clearly define what is considered ""ice-covered areas"". “But in the world doctrine and practice, the point of view that this is the entire Arctic has become quite widespread,” the lawyer explains."
2474	25	"According to him, the provision on ice covering in the article cannot be considered as a necessary condition for the emergence or disappearance of special rights for coastal states. In fact, it is only ""a means of geographically defining the area in which such rights apply, that is, the Arctic."""
2474	27	As the expert notes, the alternative reading of this rule proposed in the new American study is in conflict with the object and purpose of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. All means of interpretation indicate that the article must be applied without any connection with the change in the ice cover of the Arctic.
2474	29	It should also be remembered that the main purpose of the norm is to preserve the fragile marine environment of the Arctic Ocean, Belyakov emphasizes. - Therefore, the melting of the Arctic ice does not cancel this task, but makes it even more urgent. According to scientific studies, this process only increases the vulnerability of the Arctic region.
2476	3	Really unusual news is coming from Britain. Foreign media burst into alarmist publications on the topic that the collective Western world lives in unacceptably luxurious life and it is time to choose between personal vehicles and food. There is not an iota of exaggeration here.
2476	4	Specifically, British publications write that the inhabitants of Albion daily consume 17 thousand tons of vegetable oils (equivalent to 19 million bottles), burning them in the engines of personal and public transport. As part of the same studies, it was found that, in addition to liquids based on rapeseed, the British pour another 14 million bottles of palm and soy oil into the tanks of their cars every day. Naturally, not in its pure form, but as a fuel and all kinds of related products like additives.
2476	6	This topic has been raised on the shield due to the fact that the cost of oils and oil products based on rapeseed, soybeans and palm fruits has increased two and a half times over the past year. Concerned experts draw attention to the fact that more than 58 percent of rapeseed and about nine percent of sunflower oil in the kingdom is spent specifically on the needs of road transport, including truck tractors, the backbone of British logistics. Ecologists, unexpectedly awakened from hibernation, add that the use of so-called biofuels and oils based on plant components is - all of a sudden - not a panacea and not a cure for global warming. What's more, these same environmentalists now believe that plant-based fuels and oils have a significantly worse impact on the atmosphere and air quality than conventional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines.
2476	8	The unexpected epiphany of all kinds of fighters for decarbonization is easily explained. In everything, as always, big money is involved.
2476	9	The same sources cite disheartening statistics, from which it follows that the hype provoked by the soaring prices for vegetable oils in the food sector has led to the fact that local supermarkets are sometimes even forced to limit their sale to the population. People of the older generation at this moment could probably experience a feeling of strong deja vu with a reference to the 90s of the last century, but, fortunately, today we are not talking about what is happening in Russia.
2476	11	"The Western press, squeezed into the vise of the age-old dualism of ""who is to blame"" and ""what to do"", habitually blames Vladimir Putin for everything in the first case, but there is still a hitch with the second question."
2476	12	The fact is that the supply chains of edible oils to Britain and continental Europe collapsed with the start of a special military operation. Ukraine alone supplied half of all rapeseed oil consumed by the European Union. In comparison, the second major supplier, Australia, occupies a niche of only 27 percent. This happened, among other things, because Ukraine, over the three decades of its independence, has systematically increased the area under rapeseed, although the usefulness of this crop and its impact on the level of soil fertility are extremely doubtful. Kyiv, however, was very proud of the fact that it was the biofuel breadbasket of Europe, which was purely true, because rapeseed and oil based on it almost completely went to the West.
2476	13	With the beginning of the NMD, the agricultural sector of Ukraine staggered a lot, especially since, at the behest of geography, the main sown areas are, to one degree or another, within the zone of active clashes. Simply put, the European Union and Britain are now actively burning past biofuel stocks with the illusory hope of replenishing them this year.
2476	15	The surreal paradox of the situation lies in the fact that in the territories controlled by Russia, the sowing campaign has been carried out almost everywhere, and for certain fruit and vegetable positions, farmers are already selling their products with might and main. At the same time, Britain is acting as the main warmonger, pumping Ukraine with weapons and aggressive rhetoric of an early victory over Moscow, thereby depriving itself of the main supplier of such an important product.
2476	16	At the same time, London is well aware of the prospects and is beginning to carefully prepare the population for the inevitable choice between a strong rise in fuel prices, which will lead to the destruction of the British way of life, when a car is not a luxury, but an item of daily use, and hunger. There is no distortion here.
2476	17	All the same British and other European experts are carefully introducing the paradigm into the mass consciousness that fuels based on vegetable oils should be abandoned, even if at the expense of the usual comfort. In particular, some studies have been published, according to which, if the UK refuses biofuels, this will save food in an amount sufficient to feed three and a half million people. The same forecast says that if the United States, the European Union and Britain halve the consumption of vegetable oils and fuels (which ideally coincides with the volume of Ukrainian exports), then this will allow 125 million people to be fed without any problems.
2476	19	It is noteworthy that until quite recently, appealing to the need to strangle Russia with sanctions and stop hostilities in Ukraine, the Western press threatened hunger and massive food shortages in Africa and Asia. Today, there are no longer any geographic references, which very clearly hints at what kind of audience the foreign media machine frightens and processes.
2476	20	In order not to be accused of inflating an elephant from a local news fly, we add that, according to Western sources, the issue of a radical reduction in the consumption of biofuels and biooils for the needs of the automotive industry will be raised at the next G7 summit, which will be held on June 26-28 in Elmau Castle, which in the Bavarian Alps.
2476	21	"Before us is a clear and demonstrative collapse of the entire so carefully built environmental agenda. The entire media, and with it the political machine of the Western world, has been aggressively hammering theses into the heads of the mass layman for years about how beneficial fuels with the prefix ""bio-"" are for the environment, and therefore they need to be massively introduced as soon as possible, even if they are more expensive conventional gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. In fact, an entire industry was created from nothing, which received mega profits purely on the suggestion and processing of the philistine consciousness, while completely ignoring the fact of the extremely dubious usefulness of the product being sold. After all, it would be foolish to think that environmentalists only learned in the summer of 2022 that biofuels are not only not more useful, but even more harmful than good old hydrocarbons."
2477	3	In the West, they believe that Vladimir Putin is set for a protracted war with Ukraine, and is counting on his victory in it.
2477	4	On the hundredth day of the war against Ukraine, Russia has not achieved any of its goals, but still is not going to stop the aggression. The Washington Post believes that under the pressure of economic problems, the decisiveness of the West in support of Ukraine may weaken.
2477	6	Ukrainian victory
2477	9	Ukraine will definitely win this war,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Dutch television this week.
2477	11	Russia's war machine is already under attack from Western sanctions. Ukraine received long-range artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. The scenario of an effective Ukrainian counterattack is quite possible in order to make politicians think about the possible consequences right now. After all, if Putin is threatened with defeat, would he want to aggravate the conflict by using chemical or even nuclear weapons?
2477	13	It seems unlikely to me that Putin would admit defeat in a conventional war when he has nuclear weapons, historian Niall Ferguson recently said at a seminar at King's College London.
2477	16	Dead end
2477	19	Russia and Ukraine may come to the conclusion that they can no longer achieve anything militarily. Russia's military and economic losses are irreplaceable. The Ukrainian people are also tired of the war, people no longer want to risk their lives for the sake of an illusory victory. What if the leadership in Kyiv, not believing that the West will continue to support Ukraine, decides that it is time to sit down at the negotiating table?
2477	21	US President Joe Biden openly says that the goal of the Americans is to make sure that Ukraine has the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. Many say that the West's desire for Russia to lose is not the same as its desire for Ukraine to win.
2477	23	However, a stalemate on the battlefield can be expected for many more months, and it will be extremely difficult to achieve a political solution to the conflict. And not least because Kyiv does not trust Moscow: they believe that any agreement with Putin will be used by him as a respite to gather strength and prepare for a new attack. So the peace treaty may not last long, and hostilities will resume with renewed vigor.
2477	25	War of attrition
2477	28	The war could go on for months, or even years, while Ukrainian and Russian troops systematically grind each other down.
2477	30	The Russian president believes he can succeed by demonstrating strategic stamina and betting that the West will tire of helping Ukraine and focus on its own economy and the Chinese threat.
2477	32	"The West, however, has so far shown determination and continues to supply Ukraine with weapons. On the battlefield, front lines have practically taken shape, the war is gradually developing into a positional ""endless war""."
2477	34	"Putin “believes the West will run out,” one well-connected Russian billionaire, who spoke to the publication on condition of anonymity, told WP. According to him, initially Putin really did not expect a strong and united reaction from the West, “but now he is trying to change the situation and believes that in the long term he will win,” the billionaire said. Western leaders are vulnerable to important phases of electoral cycles, and Putin is ""convinced that public opinion can change overnight,"" the source told the dictator's train of thought."
2477	36	“The mood in the Kremlin is such that, they say, we cannot lose – and no matter what the price will be,” the source said.
2477	38	"This stance suggests that the Kremlin is counting on its ability to outlast the West in an attempt to weather the onslaught of economic sanctions. Putin has no choice but to continue the war in the hope that the grain blockade of Ukraine ""will lead to instability in the Middle East and provoke a new flow of refugees,"" said Sergei Guriev, a former chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
2477	40	truce
2477	43	"Putin could claim that his ""special military operation"" has achieved its goals: the Kremlin-backed separatists in the Donbass are securely protected, and a land corridor has been laid to Crimea. After that, he could try, from a position of moral superiority, to force Ukraine to stop hostilities."
2477	45	Russia could use this technique at any time if it wanted to play on Europe's desire to convince Ukraine to lay down its arms and give up part of its territories in exchange for a conditional peace, says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) .
2477	47	This point of view has already been voiced in Paris, Berlin and Rome: why continue the war, it's time to put an end to global economic problems, let's seek a truce.
2477	49	However, this is opposed by the United States, Great Britain and most of the countries of Eastern Europe, whose politicians are sure that the Russian invasion must fail in the interests of both Ukraine itself and the rest of Europe, as well as the international order.
2477	51	Russian victory
2477	54	The West emphasizes that Russia, despite previous failures, still has not given up plans to seize Kyiv and subjugate most of Ukraine. According to one of the government officials, no one canceled this maximum program.
2477	56	Russia can use its success in the Donbass to free up troops for action in other directions, for example, to move again to Kyiv.
2477	58	As President Zelensky himself admitted, up to a hundred Ukrainian soldiers die every day in the war, and about 500 more are injured.
2478	3	"Plan B provides that the conditions will be put forward now, and until they are met, Ukraine will be a ""candidate for candidates."""
2478	5	The European Union is considering two options for the development of the situation with granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership.
2478	7	"This is stated in the article ""European Truth""."
2478	9	Plan A provides that the European Commission will provide a conclusion that Ukraine meets the criteria, and the EU recognizes its candidate status now. All subsequent steps, such as the start of negotiations, will be subject to reforms.
2478	11	"Plan B, which is being promoted by several capitals, stipulates that the conditions will be put forward now, and until they are met, Ukraine will be a ""candidate for candidates."""
2478	13	"The list of conditions is proposed to be written in the conclusions of the European Commission, so that it does not look like the idea of ​​the member states, but of the European Commission itself. At the summit in June, in this case, Ukraine will be informed that it becomes only a ""potential candidate"", and also receives a legally recognized membership perspective, which has not yet been formally recorded in any document."
2478	15	"There is an opinion among individual officials of the European Commission and among individual member states that Plan B will not be ""bad"". It is even ""leaked"" in the media, preparing for a likely negative development. Thus, a number of media outlets disseminated Bloomberg messages with the heading Ukraine Likely to Win Initial EU Backing for Path to Membership."
2478	17	"But in the form of this victory, ""a source in the EU told reporters exactly about Plan B, which will become an unconditional defeat for Kyiv. This has already been publicly stated both in the government and on Bankova. Ukrainian reform experts who sent a letter to the EU unanimously speak about this. this cause, which has garnered unprecedented broad support,"" the article says."
2478	19	According to European Pravda, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Ukraine in the coming days. The purpose of her visit is to personally explain to Zelensky the state of affairs and suggest how Kyiv can prevent a negative decision of the summit.
248	3	"Pope Francis has announced his readiness to travel to Moscow to meet Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. During an interview with Corriere della Sera, he noted that an attempt should be made to ""stop the atrocities"" that the Putin regime has unleashed."
248	5	"On the first day of the war, I called President Zelensky. At the same time, I did not call Putin. I had the opportunity to speak to him in December for my birthday, but this time, no, I didn't call. I wanted to make a tough gesture, and for this I went to the Russian ambassador. I asked them to explain, I said: In the name of God, stop this war,"" the Pope said."
248	7	He noted that he had conveyed to Cardinal Parolin that he was ready to go to Moscow, but the pontiff had not yet received an answer.
248	9	I'm afraid that Putin is currently unable or unwilling to agree to our meeting. But how not to try to do everything possible to stop the atrocities? - he asked.
248	11	Pope Francis is not planning a visit to Ukraine.
248	13	I will not go to Kyiv yet. I sent Cardinal Michael Czerny and Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the latter visiting Kyiv for the fourth time. But I feel like I don't have to go. First I have to go to Moscow, first I have to meet with Putin. After all, I am also a priest, what can I do? I do what I can,” said the pontiff.
248	15	On May 1, Pope Francis called barbarism what Russia did to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Then he again asked to organize safe humanitarian corridors for people trapped in this city.
2480	1	What really happened in Kremenchug
2480	2	"As a result of a missile attack by Russian troops on a shopping center in Kremenchug (Poltava region of Ukraine), at least 20 civilians were killed, dozens are missing. Kyiv called the incident an act of terrorism and a ""deliberate attack on a civilian facility."""
2480	4	Russian officials first said that this was “a new Ukrainian provocation in the style of Bucha”, and then in a message from the Russian Defense Ministry they admitted that they were shelling Kremenchug.
2480	6	"However, according to the Russian military department, as a result of the strike ""on a warehouse of foreign ammunition at the Kremenchug plant of road vehicles and their subsequent detonation, a non-functioning shopping center was damaged."""
2480	8	Meduza explains why the explanations of the Russian Ministry of Defense look false.
2480	10	Around 4 p.m. on June 27, a powerful explosion occurred in the center of Kremenchug, and almost ten seconds later, a second one. At the same time, a strong fire broke out in the local Amstor shopping center. Within a few hours, it burned to the ground.
2480	12	According to the city authorities in the evening of the same day, 19 bodies were found at the site of the fire, one of the wounded died in the hospital. About 40 more people were probably in the shopping center - and have not been in touch since then. More than 50 people came to the doctors with various injuries, mostly burns.
2480	14	The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that the strike was carried out by X-22 missiles (read below about what kind of missiles) from Tu-22 bombers that took off from the Shaikovka airfield in the Kaluga region.
2480	16	Later, the Kremenchug authorities showed journalists a giant crater and a destroyed workshop at a road machinery plant located next to Amstor (known in the countries of the former USSR as the manufacturer of the Kredmash asphalt paver). The funnel is located about half a kilometer from the shopping center.
2480	18	Its very presence and location seems to confirm the version of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which stated that it had struck a blow at the plant where the ammunition was stored: they allegedly detonated and set fire to the shopping center during the explosion. However, in reality this is not the case.
2480	20	We will immediately explain why the version of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation does not hold water
2480	22	"Firstly, the ""non-functioning shopping center"", contrary to the assertion of the RF Ministry of Defense, actually worked."
2480	23	Moreover, it turned out that a few days before the attack on Kremenchug, the owners of the center ordered not to evacuate visitors and store employees during an air raid (which happens regularly there; the Ukrainian prosecutor's office has already promised to check the actions of the Amstor administration).
2480	25	Secondly, the mall was hit by another explosion, not the one that caused the crater at Kredmash.
2480	26	Thirdly, the sequence of events was basically the opposite: the explosion near the shopping center (which, apparently, led to the fire in Amstor) occurred ten seconds before the explosion in the factory shop. Judging by Google maps, there are no hangars directly at the site of the explosion near the shopping center, where ammunition, which the Russian Ministry of Defense talks about, could theoretically be stored.
2480	27	In more detail - on what these statements are based
2480	29	On June 28, several videos from surveillance cameras from the city park of Kremenchuk, which is located right behind the fence of Kredmash, appeared: the plant is located exactly in the middle between the park and Amstor.
2480	31	Judging by the videos, people and birds on the pond in the park were alarmed by something - probably a distant explosion; and 10 seconds later there was a new explosion - and very close.
2480	33	Having determined the location of the objects filmed on the video, it can be established that the epicenter of the second explosion was in the workshop of the Kredmash plant. It is impossible to find the epicenter of the first explosion from the footage - however, in one of the videos, you can see how somewhere behind the plant (approximately where the shopping center is located), even before the second explosion thundered, a column of thick smoke rises.
2480	35	In addition, Meduza obtained photographs taken on the day of the attack on Kremenchug from a hill three kilometers from the plant and Amstor. The resident of Kremenchug who sent the pictures (as he claims) asked not only to publish his name, but also the photos themselves.
2480	37	Based on them, you can find out where he lives; publishing such images could threaten Meduza's source with criminal liability in Ukraine. It was not possible to confirm the version of the origin of the filming by Meduza; at the same time, we could not detect signs of forgery.
2480	39	"The photo shows two explosions similar in power; in one, the smoke in the upper part of the ""mushroom"" had already begun to dissipate, from which it can be concluded that it occurred a little earlier. Meduza geolocated the filming location, as well as the approximate location of the explosions. The first one (where the smoke began to dissipate) happened near the Amstor shopping center; the second - on the territory of the plant ""Kredmash""."
2480	41	A series of photos (which, judging by the change in mushroom clouds from explosions, were taken in succession for tens of minutes) do not show any traces of the secondary detonation of ammunition (which were, for example, in Kyiv in March 2022 after a missile attack on the Retroville shopping center, where Ukrainian the military hid artillery and shells). The smoke from the explosions just keeps dissipating; in addition, it is clear that a fire starts in the shopping center area.
2480	43	It is possible to determine exactly where the rocket exploded near Amstor by comparing satellite images from April and June 28, 2022. The June ones show not only destruction in the shopping center, but also, presumably, a crater from a rocket explosion - right next to the single-track railway separating the territory of the shopping center and the plant.
2480	45	The likely location of the missile hit is a few tens of meters from the wall of the shopping center, behind which the Comfy store was located. It was in this store, as follows from the stories of employees of the shopping center, that there were most of the dead and missing.
2480	47	Immediately after the explosion, a fire raged there. A video of the rocket's arrival from surveillance cameras appeared, which confirms the location (the coordinates can be viewed here).
2480	49	Based on all these data, it can be confidently stated that the first rocket exploded in the immediate vicinity of Amstor, and the second one exploded in the Kredmash plant shop. It is also likely that there was no “munitions detonation”, which, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, led to a fire in the shopping center (at least 24 hours after the explosion, there was no evidence that it was).
2480	51	Only one unanswered question remains: was there ammunition or any military equipment at the Kredmash plant? The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced this without providing any evidence. AT
2480	53	The authorities of Ukraine and the management of the plant deny any military activity at the enterprise. At the same time, no traces of ammunition at the plant were noticed in the reports of local journalists (the shooting was carried out almost a day after the strike).
2480	55	Why the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation hardly “intentionally” tried to get into the shopping center
2480	57	"Based on what was found at the site of the explosions, it is difficult to conclude that there was a ""deliberate attack"" on the mall. The missile did not hit Amstor directly. The most crowded part of the shopping center - the Silpo supermarket, according to the center's employees, was almost not injured in the first minutes after the explosion (but then it was also destroyed by fire)."
2480	59	Formally, the explosions of both missiles took place on the territory of a neighboring plant - but one of them fell in the immediate vicinity of Amstor. It is logical to assume that the plant was the target of both strikes.
2480	61	"The rest can be explained by the characteristics of the missiles used to strike (if we accept the version of the Ukrainian authorities that these were Kh-22 missiles). The fact is that these missiles are not designed for accurate attacks on ground targets such as ""building"". They were developed in the 1960s (and modernized in the 1970s) for a narrow niche of application - attacking large groups of ships and NATO aircraft carriers."
2480	63	Missiles have two complementary guidance methods:
2480	65	After modernization, most of the flight, the rocket was guided using an inertial system: first, the exact position of the carrier aircraft at launch (a reference point in the coordinate system) was determined, and then a special system counted all changes in the position of the rocket as it moved away from this reference point - altitude, heading, as well as drift angles due to wind.
2480	66	With these calculations, errors inevitably accumulate, which prevent the missile from being brought to the target accurately enough to destroy even a large ship. The circular probable deviation from the target when using the Kh-22 only with an inertial system is, according to open data, about 500 meters.
2480	68	In order for the missile to hit the aircraft carrier (having already approached it), a homing head with a radar indication was initially placed in it: it itself aimed at the ship with the greatest reflectivity.
2480	69	Due to the low accuracy of the inertial system during the late USSR, targets of the “group of ships” type (or a single ship in conditions of radio interference that interfere with radar guidance) were supposed to be attacked only with nuclear weapons with a capacity of one megaton.
2480	71	It is clear that the radar system is not suitable for attacking a target of the “factory shop” type, and therefore the missile is used only in the “area target” attack mode, but with a “normal” high-explosive fragmentation warhead. With low accuracy, it can hit targets with a very large mass of the warhead - about 900 kilograms, which is almost twice as much as the operational-tactical and cruise missiles Iskander and Caliber, which Russia uses in this war.
2480	72	The Kh-32 missile, which should replace the Kh-22 in the troops, also has almost half the mass of the warhead (in addition, it should be much more accurate). The X-32 has an altimeter correction system that allows you to find references on the ground during the flight.
2480	74	The main advantage of the Kh-22 over other missiles is that a lot of them were produced. So, only Ukraine, having abandoned nuclear warheads and all missiles capable of carrying them, handed over almost 400 Kh-22s to Russia.
2480	75	It is not known how many of them remained in the warehouses of the Russian army (some were disposed of in recent decades), but it is clear that the Russian army can attack them for months - and will increasingly do so as the arsenals of more modern missiles are depleted.
2480	77	Is it possible to hit such inaccurate, but such powerful missiles at objects located in the city?
2480	79	It is forbidden. In this case, there are signs of a war crime - one of the many committed by Russia during the invasion of Ukraine.
2481	2	Political scientist and senior fellow at University College London Vladimir Pastukhov in the Borisychi program discusses what the Russia of the future should be like after the war in Ukraine and after Putin's departure.
2481	4	- There is no “good tsar” in the system of the Russian structure. The only way is to beat (the king - S.) on the hands. Another question is who will strike hands in a country where there are no traditions of free thinking, dignity, and so on? Who can hit on the hands? We need a counterbalance,” says Vladimir Pastukhov, discussing the possible political construction of post-Putin Russia. – And if you think that I am offering Russia a soft-bodied device in the style of a powerless center and “take as much sovereignty as you can”, then I am a utopian and then everyone in Russia will really bite each other.
2481	6	I suggest a strong center. As strong as he was, so strong he will remain. But there are two types of strong centers.
2481	8	A strong center with a counterbalance in the form of the rights of the regions, and then it balances and does not allow this strong center to fall on everyone's head and crush them to pieces. That is, he will always be strong and stronger than the regions, but he can be absolutely strong, like today, when he flattens us all, or you can hang a weight on the other side of him, and this weight will always pull him away.
2481	10	As for the greater federalization of the future Russia, Vladimir Pastukhov considers it a deterrent, including from the events that began on February 24:
2481	12	- Let's imagine that there is a federal center and there are 15-20 other centers of power, and all of them together at the same time and completely went crazy. And if they decide that now they will take a nuclear bomb and destroy Europe, and as a result they will destroy themselves, then no one will help us.
2481	14	<<But there are two situations. First, we have one center of power and no one else. And he alone can make any decision, and we see this today, when he evolved towards a new religious and mythological worldview, he accepted messianism, accepted it and that's it.
2481	17	The second is when there is much less chance that, given 15 counterweights, all 15 will go insane.>>
2481	19	It's like in a situation with a German plane crash, where one pilot left the cockpit to the toilet, and the other closed himself inside and crashed the plane. Now pilots are no longer allowed to leave one pilot inside. There should always be two people in the cab. Because the likelihood that both will go crazy is much less.
2481	21	The federated system is just a safety net for just such cases. Yes, not as strong as you, but each of them has guaranteed rights, their own money, their own legislation, their own local police.
2481	23	And then they say to the head of one of them: “You have a good region, oil is pumping, you trade with China, but here in Moscow the idea came up - we will fight with Ukraine.” He says, “Are you crazy? Yes, I just now have several contracts signed for the construction of the three largest factories. Everything will fly away with me because of your sanctions.” And in the federal system, he can say this, but today there is no one to say this.
2481	25	As for his forecast about how the reorganization of Russia after Putin can take place and whether it will be bloodless, Vladimir Pastukhov adheres to a pessimistic-optimistic view:
2481	27	Whoever hinders us will help us. First, the civil war is already underway, he believes. - Secondly, I am convinced that we do not understand what we got into on February 24th. We got into something that will inevitably result in the collapse of Russian statehood. The transition of this hidden civil war into a completely open form.
2481	29	<<We inertially live in some kind of illusion that everything will work out. It won't cost. The decision made by Putin and his entourage is historically apocalyptic.>>
2481	31	We can argue about whether it will take a year, two, five, ten, fifteen - that I cannot know. I can say that at the end of a certain cycle, this decision on war will mean the deepest crisis of Russian statehood.
2481	33	But good global ideas come when everything around is in ruins. While you live in your house, you have a roof over your head and it doesn’t drip over you, then you have to be a very smart person to say “yes, I understand that my house will collapse, I’ll take it apart myself now.”
2483	3	First, the President of the United States at the G20 summit in Rome showed how to live beautifully - eighty-five huge cars of his cortege raced through the streets of the Eternal City. “Real life flew past, joyfully trumpeting and sparkling with lacquer wings,” as the Soviet classics of satire wrote.
2483	5	"In fact, everything is not as funny as it might seem. Sleepy Joe just showed how the global elite sees the future of our planet after the introduction of ""climate protection measures"" with the rejection of internal combustion engines and the suppression of motorization - the elite will not give up anything, but the serfs who think they are middle class and creative People will stand in the golden dust with their bicycles, breaking their hats in their hands, seeing off the elites with a hungry look."
2483	7	"The fantastic hypocrisy displayed by the so-called world leaders in the ""energy transition"" at two consecutive summits - in Rome (G20) and in Glasgow (COP26), overflows. During the pandemic, these people have completely ceased to be ashamed of anything and clearly state: “we set the rules for you, the proletarians, they do not concern us.” Why proletarians? “Yes, because you are in flight! Boo-ha-ha."""
2483	9	"Yes, indeed, in addition to an unprecedented roll on the auto industry and car owners, the “fight for climate” also implies a fight against the aviation industry and air travel. Greta Thunberg is using literally tons of green fertilizer to campaign against ""home"" flights, which she and the people behind her accuse of producing an unmeasured amount of CO2."
2483	11	We will not remind the activists that with all the planes the last year and a half has not been very good and nature has become incredibly clean. But the faces of ordinary activists are not cheerful - they would have to land the entire air fleet on the ground. And then in the summer, people still adapted to go to the south of Europe on vacation, and Ryanair broke into the lead with millions of flights. The fact is that the target of climate fighters is precisely these flights, which last one to two hours. In fact, the main consumer of these flights is small and medium-sized businessmen and millions of vacationers who buy package tours at sea, having collected money for the whole family in the bottom of the barrel in a year. That is a very simple and unsophisticated people.
2483	13	And here, under the talk that the people, in the name of building communism, that is, achieving climate neutrality (the creators of the CPSU program, who promised communism by 1985, just hung themselves with envy), should tighten their belts, not eat meat, change to bicycles and get ready to rationed electricity, the owners of discourse and paradigm began to arrive at the climate summit in Glasgow.
2483	15	"The first to fire was British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who arrived by plane (flight London - Glasgow, 1 hour 20 minutes). Well, you understand - an important person, he has no time. That is what he told reporters when asked if it was ethical to fly a local flight when the climate was in danger. “And the train takes too long,” Johnson replied. Surprisingly - we say the same thing. And millions of people say the same thing - ""the train is too long"", but they are poked like puppies into a puddle, into a carbon footprint: ""shame, shame, shame, don't do that again."""
2483	17	Then climate activist Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon, arrived in a private Gulfstream jet with his girlfriend. Private jets, for you to understand, are the anti-leaders in terms of the “emission / number of passengers” ratio. There were two passengers. Before that, they visited Bill Gates' personal steamship, which also does not ozonize the atmosphere with its three huge diesel engines. But how can you poison respected people for such trifles? Vaughn Bezos promised to roll out a couple of billion dollars for the cause of climate protection. True, what they will do is not very clear.
2483	19	"As we understand, the rest of the summit participants did not come on foot either: according to the German edition of Focus, 400 private jets were used to deliver especially important climatic bodies to Glasgow. Four hundred (in words) private jets! Joe Biden, who also travels around Scotland with a motorcade, has slightly reduced his appetites and now there are fewer than eighty-five. It's just that you haven't seen Scottish roads and Scotland in general - there is simply no room for eighty-five ""suburbans"". But, nevertheless, kind people have already posted photos of giant American cars greedily refueling with diesel (cursed by all climate fighters) at a local gas station."
2483	20	Nobody is embarrassed anymore. The public is presented directly and shamelessly with a world in which the enjoyment of the benefits of civilization is the prerogative of the rich and powerful, and the rest must gradually strengthen in a world that is no longer affected by the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Of course, under the beautiful slogans and drumming. I remember that many excellent democratic slogans led societies to the Gulag and other democratic institutions.
2484	3	A small island in the ocean puts a big question mark in front of the idea of ​​abandoning fertilizers and pesticides / © Wikimedia Commons
2484	5	"Local officials are trying to shift the blame for what happened to a sharp decrease in tourist traffic due to the coronavirus, but the numbers show that the key problem is completely different. In 2019, the president, a supporter of fashionable green ideas, won the elections in this country. Soon they banned the sale of mineral fertilizers and moved towards ""sustainable agriculture."" How exactly did the popular ""organic"" ideas influence the not so long ago rapidly growing local economy? And why can the lessons of the Sri Lankan tragedy be useful even to the West and Russia?"
2484	7	More recently, Sri Lanka has been among the leaders of South Asia in terms of GDP per capita and its growth rate. And now there are queues for kerosene on the streets, electricity is cut off massively, and the country itself has declared a default - and not purely technical, as Russia will soon have, but a real one, with corresponding consequences.
2484	9	It is often said that victory has many fathers, and defeat is fatherless. But in Ceylon (the old name of the island), the opposite happened: many parents were immediately found for the economic defeat of the state. The official version of the authorities is simple: there used to be a lot of tourists, then the coronavirus came and ate all tourism. Simple, clear...and wrong.
2484	11	Yes, 1.9 million tourists visited the country in 2019, bringing in $3.5 billion. And in 2021 there were only 194 thousand of them (in 2020 - 570 thousand). It seems that a tenfold drop in tourist revenue fully justifies the position of local politicians: a relatively small economy has lost more than three billion dollars in annual income. In the end, default most often occurs exactly where foreign exchange earnings become less than foreign exchange expenditures.
2484	13	However, as American folk wisdom says, there is a sure sign that allows you to understand when politicians are cheating: their lips move. Let's try to check the position of the official Colombo (this is the name of the local capital) with the numbers in hand. The very first discovery: tourism has never been either the first or even the second source of currency for this country. In the same 2019, Sri Lanka received only $19.42 billion from the export of goods and services, that is, tourism covered only 18.0% of the total foreign exchange inflow.
2484	15	"In 2020, Sri Lankan exports of goods and services (which includes tourism) fell by 31.1%, while tourism itself reduced the country's foreign exchange earnings by only 15 percent, much less than any other factors. So what are these ""other factors""?"
2484	17	Ceylon tea and others
2484	18	"Sri Lanka - ""blessed land"" in Sanskrit - this island began to be called only after independence in 1972. And before that, he bore the name Ceylon received from the colonialists. Coffee was once the main export commodity of the island, but the fungus Hemileia vastatrix destroyed all coffee plantations in the 19th century, and since then the island has switched to tea - all these ""Dilmas"" and a number of other brands that until recently were found in every Russian supermarket . Despite the small area (less than half of the Vologda Oblast), the warm climate made it possible to grow 10% of the world's tea there."
2484	20	Of course, agriculture in such a place also included rice and coconuts, and the total share of food in local exports was 26.1%. For comparison: in Russia, gas accounts for only 11.1% of exports, that is, its significance for our balance of payments is ~2.5 times less than the export of food for Sri Lanka.
2484	22	And here such a powerful factor as ideology came into play. The economist John Keynes a century ago aptly stated:
2484	24	"“The ideas of economists and political thinkers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are of much greater importance than is commonly thought. In fact, only they rule the world. The practical men who consider themselves to be completely unaffected by intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some departed economist of the past.” Nowadays, of course, Keynes's phrase needs to be updated: it is necessary to add the words ""(as well as eco-activists)"" to it."
2484	26	Such intellectual slavery of politicians and peoples ruled by them is a constant phenomenon of recent centuries, which determines the development of entire countries and peoples. The ideas that won in the 1790s caused the French economy to lose the first place among European powers it had held before the French Revolution. Erroneous Marxist ideas led Russia and China through famine and economic failure on a scale never seen before in world history. This cup has not passed and the third world.
2484	28	"Of course, Marxism is not so much in vogue today, but other ideas are “on horseback”. Ecofeminist Vindana Shiva has been waging a relentless struggle against all major technologies of intensive farming for decades - a struggle for which she has been dubbed ""grain Gandhi."" Moreover, her ideas are extremely popular, and not only in India, where she lives, but throughout South Asia and even in Western countries."
2484	30	Shiva's basic theses are familiar even to those who have never heard her name, they have become typical for all supporters of organic farming from California to Japan. The key one is that the green revolution was evil. Recall: the green revolution is called the fundamental restructuring of agriculture that began in the 1950s around the world.
2484	32	The essence of the revolution was to replace traditional crop varieties with new, highly productive hybrids. True, these hybrids themselves often poorly retained their properties during subsequent reproduction outside breeding centers. Because of this, the seeds for them were obtained not from the previous harvest, but all in the same centers. In addition, the green revolution included in its formula for success the application of a significant amount of fertilizers to increase yields and pesticides to reduce crop losses from pests.
2484	34	"Vindana Shiva repeatedly stated: ""The Green Revolution left farmers poor, so much so that now they commit suicide"" (by the way, by the millions). Fertilizers? “These are military chemicals made from fossil fuels,” she tweeted."
2484	36	Vindana Shiva is also a sharp critic of GMOs, among other things. However, GMOs in Sri Lanka were unprofitable without it, which is why there was no point in fighting them here / © Wikimedia Commons
2484	38	Of course, one could say that all this strongly smacks of anti-science (although she has a degree from a Western university) approach. Yes, and statistics show that the well-being of Indian farmers after the green revolution has increased dramatically, and the suicide rate among them is declining.
2484	40	But the numbers are not important for Vindana Shiva. If fertilizers are made from fossil fuels, then this is evil. And point.
2484	42	The ideas underlying her thesis are similar to those expressed by Rachel Carson, an American known for fighting DDT in the 1960s (we wrote about this tragedy here). Namely: everything natural is good, but much that comes from man is evil. In nature, they say, there are no pesticides or fertilizers (this, of course, is not the case, in nature there are thousands of pesticides of biological origin, which we also wrote about). Hence, there is nothing good in them, and this should be avoided in agriculture as well.
2484	44	Simply put, Vindana Shiva is Greta Thunberg, only born in 1952: a lady who has a certain set of views, and is completely indifferent to the fact that the real world does not coincide with this set.
2484	46	"All this would be just a funny page in the history of human delusions, if not for one ""but"". The world is not ultimately ruled by politicians, because they do not invent ideas. The world is ruled by those who invent ideas that will eventually be implemented by politicians."
2484	48	Vindana Shiva did not just successfully speak from the high western stands, where all this organic farming is very much in vogue. She became one of the main thinkers who influenced the formation of ideas in the mind of Gotabai Rajapaksa.
2484	50	This democratically elected president of Sri Lanka, during his election campaign, actively promoted the idea of ​​​​transition to organic farming and the abandonment of fertilizers, just in the spirit of Shiva's famous statements that fertilizers should not have been allowed for use in agriculture at all. And, of course, she was an adviser to the Sri Lankan state in this matter.
2484	52	So, the thinker once again seized into intellectual slavery another, in the words of Keynes, a man of practice who considers himself completely unaffected by intellectual influences. What came of it?
2484	54	The fate of manure in a tropical climate
2484	55	In April 2021, the government of Sri Lanka materialized Vindana Shiva's theses on the ban on fertilizers and pesticides: their import into the country was banned. By the way, one of the reasons was the need to save foreign currency, for which all this was bought. Fertilizers and pesticides did cost a couple of hundred million dollars a year.
2484	57	The first agricultural season of 2021 (there are two of them a year on the island) was not affected by the “organic green transition”: fertilizers and pesticides from warehouses closed the issue. The problems started in the second season:
2484	59	The climate on the island is quite equatorial, which is why the problem of weeds is very acute / © Wikimedia Commons
2484	61	“It is more than clear that this 2021/2022 season's rice harvest will be 40-45% below average. The main reason is the transition from synthetic to organic fertilizers...forced by politicians through directives. It was predictable - it is enough to know how organic fertilizers affect crops, as well as the fate of organic fertilizers in tropical conditions, ”
2484	63	- writes a representative of the local agricultural industry.
2484	65	So it is, about organic fertilizers, he is absolutely right. Any hot climate makes long-term storage and transportation of manure a full-fledged ancient adventure on Homeric scales. The ideologues of organic farming usually miss this point: it is assumed that agriculture should consist of small farms, where the farmer collects manure from his own cattle, and therefore there are no problems of transportation and storage at all.
2484	67	However, the economic reality is that, in most cases, breaking even agriculture requires specialization in either pastoralism or arable farming—and Sri Lanka is expected to be dominated by the latter. Therefore, manure is scarce here.
2484	69	Importing it from other countries, even if we do not talk about the deadly smell and rapid decay during such transportation in the heat, is expensive. Because the main part of the manure is not the nitrogen, potassium and the like that plants need, but rotting organic residues from carbon and hydrogen. Simply put, to replace 1 ton of mineral fertilizers, you will have to import many tons of manure - or lower yields.
2484	71	It is expensive to import many tons of manure, so in the end, the agriculture of the former Ceylon went the second way.
2484	73	The result was predictable: rice prices on the island rose by 50%. From a crop failure, he turned from a rice exporter into an importer - rice had to be imported for $ 450 million, more than twice as much as spending on fertilizer imports. The country's foreign exchange balance received a double blow: exports fell, as rice fell out of exports, and imports rose, since all the same rice now has to be imported.
2484	75	"Maybe only the rice was damaged? No: last season's corn harvest was 50,000 tons, and this year they predict... 60 tons (yes, that's not a typo, almost a thousand times less). Well, what's the point of planting corn if its reduced yield will make the cost of such an ""organic crop"" higher than market prices? The need for corn has not gone away: now it just has to be imported."
2484	77	Lost revenues from tea exports in the last three months of 2020 alone amount to $25 million. The total harm to the Sri Lankan tea industry is $425 million. Yields of other important local export crops — coconut palm and hevea (rubber) — also fell by tens of percent.
2484	79	The catastrophe became so obvious that in November 2021, Rajapaksa finally gave in and reversed the decision to ban the import of fertilizers and pesticides. So far, only in relation to export crops: the inflow of foreign currency into the country was especially acutely dependent on them.
2484	81	Alas, it was too late: the struggle of the Europeans with long-term contracts with Gazprom raised the price of gas in Europe, and then around the world. And the cost of fertilizers, even before the rise in gas prices by 80%, was formed by him.
2484	83	When fertilizers were allowed to be sold again, a black market had already formed for them, with inflated prices typical of it. Sri Lankan farmers are protesting against this ugly phenomenon, but no one has yet been able to curb it. Despite the hot climate, everyone is wearing masks: in this sense, Sri Lanka is definitely ahead of Russia / © Wikimedia Commons
2484	85	As a result, buying fertilizers at the new prices turned out to be unaffordable for local agriculture, which was badly affected by the drop in yields “according to the organic scenario”.
2484	87	Now there is a crisis in Sri Lanka: the government, apparently, will change, the country has declared a default, there is not enough currency to buy energy resources that have risen in price around the world, which is why electricity has been turned off on the island since the end of March.
2484	89	The islanders, who have never seen such a thing almost never, protest. But this situation cannot be rectified quickly: fertilizers and pesticides are much more expensive this year than in the past. And farmers have never had enough money to buy them, because a year without a harvest has knocked the ground out from under their feet.
2484	91	Is “organic farming” capable of feeding anyone normally?
2484	92	"Organic farming is of three types. The first is ""California"". Farmers grow everything on manure and without pesticides, as a result they invest a lot of manual labor in weeding and have yields 20-30% lower than those who apply mineral fertilizers and pesticides."
2484	94	The price of their products is at least tens of percent higher than in the supermarket. But their customers are people with complex ideas in their heads and therefore pay higher prices with the same ease with which Mavrodi's clients gave money to MMM in the 1990s. This model is stable: there are enough wealthy people with specific ideas in developed countries.
2484	96	"The second type of ""organic farming"" is in the poorest parts of Africa: the locals simply don't have the money for fertilizers and pesticides. They live mainly on subsistence farming and starve in case of crop failure, since they also do not have cash reserves to buy food on the market."
2484	98	"The third, local variety of ""organic farming"" is the ""Ovsyannikov variant"", no-till farming in the form in which it was invented by a Russian agronomist at the end of the 19th century. It is practiced, for example, in the Penza region. Fertilizers are not normally applied here (and even manure), but the yield is decent, since tractors plow everything except the harvested grain back into the ground with special agricultural implements. In the “hay-straw” land, after harvesting, the wheat rots, providing the next year with a normal level of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil."
2484	100	The problem of “how to deal with weeds without herbicides” is also solved by machines, and not by “chemistry”: the weeds are allowed to germinate first in the spring, and then the tractors pass, grind them, plowing the remains into the ground (a kind of “green manure”). Wheat is already sown on top of such processing.
2484	102	"This scheme works, but it has a huge drawback, because of which the theorists of organic farming will never be satisfied with it: it does not solve problems ""in a natural way"", but by the optimal use of mechanized tillage."
2484	104	"Meanwhile, all theorists of organic farming require maximum ""naturalness"" from it. This may be one of the reasons why the Ovsyannikov scheme is not used in the Western world (there is no-till farming in the West, but it is completely different, still with fertilizers)."
2484	106	The Ceylonese do not live in Russia, they have a different climate and basic cultures, and they have no information about Ovsyannikov's methods. So, in theory, they could maintain their yields in only one way: to import several times more manure to the island than they previously imported mineral fertilizers, and also to sharply increase the investment of labor in their agriculture.
2484	108	Because the cultivation of tea bushes is not wheat in the Penza region. Walking across the field with a tractor, chopping all the weeds with a special tool and plowing them, will not work. And weeds in a warm and humid climate grow very intensively - as, in fact, cultivated plants. So they would have to be weeded out by hand, attracting a lot more people than before. Well, or enjoying the drop in yield. Sri Lanka, August 3, 2021, manual weeding of a tea plantation.

2484	110	Sri Lanka has only a couple of million farmers, less than 10% of the population. Therefore, the island spontaneously took the second path, and not at all the first.
2484	112	"By the way: Vindana Shiva, although he does not offer to solve the problem of weeds other than by hand, offers an ""organic"" means of controlling insect pests. This, attention, is the oil of the Indian neem tree."
2484	114	Well, it's a really good insecticide... only it, like all biopesticides, is much more expensive than chemical ones. And, of course, the Sri Lankans could not use it, because the oil is too expensive for farmers with incomes below California.
2484	116	Lessons: Still Not Learned
2484	117	"In fact, the main lesson of the Sri Lankan crisis is not at all the fallacy of the ideas of organic farming. It was obvious even before that: it was well known from the experience of developed countries that the costs of ""organic"" farmers are higher, and their yields are lower."
2484	119	The main lesson from Sri Lanka is the pointlessness of the “cancellation culture” in relation to the ideas of technological progress. Since the 1960s, since Rachel Carson's crusade against pesticides and a similar anti-nuclear crusade, ideas have been spreading around the world about the harmfulness and harmfulness of key technologies used by modern man.
2484	121	"If before the 1960s people saw progress as a means of increasing prosperity and the basis of the success of our species, after that they increasingly see it as a source of evil. ""Sustainable"" is now called such systems of management, which minimally use energy and substances from anthropogenic sources. The sun should shine over the field and it should rain - and that's it."
2484	123	This is a false concept. The use of technology, synthesized fertilizers and pesticides appeared for a reason, but because it allowed us to get much more food from the same area of ​​​​land than any organic farming can do.
2484	125	Brown shows the area under cereals in the world. It is easy to see that they have changed little for more than half a century. Green shows those lands that the increase in productivity, which has happened since the Green Revolution, allows not to use / ©OurWorldInData
2484	127	"The same can be said about other harsh accusations against progress from the same Vindana Shiva and her associates. Speaking of the ""climate crisis"", she forgets to clarify that the anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide that gave rise to it led the terrestrial vegetation to the most prosperous state in the last 50 thousand years at least. Speaking about the perniciousness of fertilizers, Shiva forgets that no modern country has been able to solve the food problem without them."
2484	129	The key lesson from Sri Lanka is that we need to stop thinking as idiots those who have created technological progress, because of which we have been using less and less land for 30 years, but in the end we have the least hunger in the history of the human species.
2485	3	Still, Ukraine, with all its madness, is very much needed by Russia as an example of how not to live. For example, one cannot use vaccination just for the sake of vaccination and lining the pockets of oligarchs and officials. It was this fascinating activity that caused the first open anti-vaccination parental rebellion in Europe, which the WHO, the Supreme Court, the media, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education of Ukraine cannot suppress now. After the work of Canadian Uliana Suprun, who fled the country, and the mass deaths of children from poor-quality vaccines, people refuse to believe them and are more likely to pay for a fake certificate than to play the lottery with the health and life of a child.
2485	6	"The last to attack Ukrainian parents was the Supreme Court of Ukraine, which recently ruled that an unvaccinated child should not attend kindergarten. This is stated in the decision of the court dated April 17, 2019. He did not satisfy the claim of the mother, who defended her right to take her child to a preschool educational institution without mandatory vaccinations. It should be noted that back in June 2016, a Ukrainian woman filed a lawsuit demanding not to interfere with her unvaccinated child in receiving preschool education. At first, her claim was satisfied by the decision of the Slavuta District Court of the Khmelnytsky region. However, in 2017, the preschool educational institution filed an appeal, which was granted. But the decision of the court of first instance was canceled, and a new decision was made, which denied the claim. We add that the Supreme Court decided that the individual interest of a person (refusing to be vaccinated) cannot be placed above the general interest of society - not to get sick with infectious diseases. The court ruling stated that ""the task of the state is to ensure that the optimal balance is maintained between the realization of the child's right to preschool education and the interests of other children."""
2485	8	This was the first official victory of officials over their parents. Earlier, in September 2018, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine sent an official letter to the heads of all regional state administrations, in which they decided not to allow unvaccinated children to enter educational institutions. Now this rule has been fixed by the court. The Ukrainians themselves told RIA Katyusha that they are now waiting for a sharp rise in the price of fake vaccination certificates from about a thousand rubles for our money to one and a half to two thousand. According to the inhabitants of the country, this is not the highest price for the life of their child.
2485	10	"You can understand officials and judges - they simply have nowhere to go: in connection with the measles epidemic, which began to spread across Europe from Ukraine, everyone is putting pressure on them - WHO, UNICEF, the European Union. Western ""partners"" openly demand to bring the vaccination rate from the African level to at least some decent indicators. Today Ukraine is on a par with Romania and Albania."
2485	12	It would seem, what is the question, it is necessary to cure everyone, instill and there will be happiness. However, then the department of a Canadian citizen with a diploma of a paramedic, an activist of the Maidan, the former head of the Ministry of Health, Uliana Suprun, who has now fled from Ukraine, enters the matter. In fact, her role in the current anti-vaccination riot is difficult to overestimate. Having carried out the most serious work on the collapse of medical care, district hospitals and ambulances as such, she and her team actively took up vaccination and received an epidemic of complications after vaccinations against polio, after which even doctors rebelled against vaccination. “The Government of Canada provided 3 million Canadian dollars as a humanitarian aid for the purchase of OPV and IPV (polio vaccine) by the UNICEF Children's Fund. The total procurement includes 1.1 million doses of IPV vaccine and 3.7 million doses of OPV vaccine. On June 26 (2014), the Ministry of Health of Ukraine announced that the first batch of vaccines was received in the amount of 1.5 million doses of OPV and 600,000 doses of IPV.
2485	14	"According to the preventive vaccination calendar, in Ukraine, vaccination of children for the prevention of poliomyelitis is carried out at the age of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 18 months, 6 years and 14 years. The OPV vaccine is used for the 3rd to 6th vaccination (at 6 months, 18 months, 6 years and 14 years of age) in the absence of contraindications to OPV. The annual need for OPV vaccine is about 2 million doses. Given the need for such a volume and humanitarian aid in the amount of 1.5 million doses, continuous vaccination can be carried out for 9 months ... At the same time, the vaccine arrived in Ukraine in a thawed form: the temperature regime during the transportation of the vaccine was observed in the range from 2 to 8 ° C , which is allowed by the instructions of the drug. But. Such storage conditions significantly reduce the shelf life (up to 6 months from the date of defrosting!) and increase the risk of not using the vaccine, instead of the possibility of using the vaccine for 2 years when stored in a refrigerator in frozen form (-20 ° C). UNICEF deliberately supplied the drug after defrosting, which obliges us to promptly use the OPV vaccine to vaccinate the country's population in the near future. After receiving the humanitarian cargo, the next day, May 22, the State Enterprise ""Ukrvaktsyna"" writes a letter to the Deputy Minister of Health Peregynets I.B. with a request to clarify the regime for the subsequent storage of vaccines. The letter informs that the goods were accepted for storage at the warehouse on May 21, and focuses on the transportation of the vaccine at a temperature of 2-8 °C. As a result of the change in the cold chain, the state-owned enterprise also confirms changes in the expiration dates, which have been reduced to 6 months from the date of production, and the inability to refreeze the vaccine if it has already been thawed. The apogee of history was the resolution on May 29 by Deputy Minister Igor Peregynets, who single-handedly decides to re-freeze the vaccine to -20 ° C according to UNICEF recommendations, contrary to the instructions for the drug. Perhaps the responsible persons of the Ministry of Health or UNICEF relied on the OPV instructions from other manufacturers, where several “defrost-freeze” cycles are allowed. But for the OPVERO vaccine, this is prohibited! The decision of the Deputy Minister was, of course, carried out. 1.5 million doses of the OPV vaccine were re-frozen,” the Medical Control portal tells this sentimental story."
2485	16	It would seem that the most reasonable thing to do after that was to simply throw away the spoiled vaccines and not risk it, but no - how could Ukraine throw away so much valuable humanitarian cargo? The vaccine was re-thawed, injected into children. The result was not long in coming. Here are just a few cases from the list of Ukrainian media:
2485	18	On November 3, 2015, Kolya Antonyuk, aged 5.5, died. Symptoms of an intestinal viral infection: abdominal pain, high fever. According to available information, he was vaccinated against polio on October 29th. Vinnitsa. Girl, 4 years old. I was vaccinated against poliomyelitis in the Sabarovsk kindergarten. Hospitalized with symptoms of a viral infection (high temperature). She died on the same day. The information was received on November 25, 2015.
2485	20	Belaya Tserkov, November 25, 2015, boy, 3.5 years old. He was vaccinated at the beginning of the month, hospitalized with symptoms of an intestinal viral infection (high fever, abdominal pain, nausea). Received a course of antibiotic therapy. He died suddenly a few days after discharge. There is information about the falsification of medical records.
2485	22	Volyn region, Kovel-Lutsk, October 28, 2015, Tanya Karpovich, 9 months old. She was hospitalized with symptoms of an intestinal viral infection - vomiting, high fever. Transferred to the regional hospital, medical care was not urgently provided. Died a few hours later.
2485	24	A wave of complications and deaths swept over Ukraine, and doctors were extremely reluctant to admit that this particular vaccine was to blame. Although there were those who sided with their parents. “It is not unilaterally possible to accuse our people of not wanting to vaccinate their children. Because with those games that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, headed by Ulyana Suprun, arranged, when low-quality vaccines are imported... Remember the polio vaccine, everyone was forced to be vaccinated again, and there were so many complications. Now our children are dying after being vaccinated. Recently, a 6-month-old child died at the kindergarten teacher where my daughter went. A healthy 6-month-old boy received a routine vaccine and died of encephalitis. Prior to this, the child was healthy. Therefore, I understand all the fears of the population of our country and I believe that I cannot unambiguously condemn those Ukrainians who do not want to vaccinate their children. And I can’t say that all vaccines are harmful and all that. This issue should be approached quite balancedly,” said Oleg Panasenko, chairman of the free trade union of medical workers of Ukraine.
2485	26	According to Oleg Panasenko, their Ministry of Health actually forced children to be “utilizers” of the polio vaccine. “It was brought here to Ukraine for our children, they even forced them to re-vaccinate with this already low-quality vaccine in order not to pay money for its disposal, because this is also a lot of money,” he said.
2485	28	"And if Suprun had stopped there - but no, the enterprising lady continued to ""save"" and buy incomprehensibly what and incomprehensibly from whom - for example, in India. “As for the purchased DTP vaccine for the prevention of whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus (Serum Institute, India), the Ministry of Health did not record complications after vaccination, but only reactions “that are included in the picture of post-vaccination reactions.” I quote: ""They are the safest in the world,"" Acting Minister of Health Uliana Suprun said during a briefing,"" journalists reported back in 2018. They also found out that this vaccine has never been used in North America or Europe - anywhere except Ukraine. Thrice assuring everyone that the vaccine was tested, Suprun literally immediately received a loud scandal after the death of six-month-old Olesya from Ternopil, who died the next day after being vaccinated with the DTP vaccine from the Serum Institute of India."
2485	30	"The epidemic of death from vaccines is still going on: on March 29 of this year, a six-month-old girl died after being vaccinated against poliomyelitis and hepatitis in the Rivne region. The baby was vaccinated in one of the medical institutions in the city of Kostopol. This is reported by the ""observer"" with reference to the communication department of the Main Directorate of the National Police in the Rivne region. In the evening, the child's health deteriorated sharply. The parents called an ambulance. Before her arrival, the baby had died."
2485	32	Now for the measles epidemic. The fact is that, despite the extensive PR campaign for vaccination and the persecution of opponents, it has already been proven that the vaccine does not work there. Since 2017, 27 people have died from complications of measles in Ukraine. This was stated by the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Health Olga Bogomolets, the press service of the committee reports. “27 patients have died from measles complications since 2017 (2017 – 5, 2018 – 16, since the beginning of 2019 – 6 people have died),” said Bogomolets.
2485	34	She also named the number of cases of measles during this period.
2485	36	“Since 2017, for the third year in a row, an epidemic increase in the incidence of measles has been observed in Ukraine. During this time, more than 71.5 thousand cases of measles were registered among the population (2017 - 4782 cases, 2018 - 52 349 cases, for 5 weeks of 2019 - 15 095 cases),” said Bogomolets.
2485	38	"And the problem here turned out to be that among the dead, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated are almost on a par. “The child who died in Odessa was not vaccinated. But even vaccination does not save from the disease. As reported by ""FACTS"", in the school of the village of Ivanovo, Limansky district, Odessa region, 12 children fell ill, six of whom were vaccinated twice, four - once, and only two children were not vaccinated. In October, a 12-year-old boy died in Transcarpathia, whose parents wrote a refusal to be vaccinated. And in January, a 17-year-old girl died in Odessa from pneumonia, which arose as a complication after measles. Her father said that her daughter had been vaccinated twice,” Ukrainian media reported."
2485	40	The conclusion suggests itself: if the difference between the sick, and most importantly the dead, with and without vaccination does not differ much, then either the vaccine simply does not work, or there are some “other” reasons. Regarding the vaccine, it is more than possible, given the experience of past purchases by Suprun's department and her flight too soon after Poroshenko's departure. However, there is another “either” called “Health System”. No matter what anyone says, the vaccine is not a panacea and not a magic elixir, after taking which you are protected from the disease. If hospitals do not work or there are no medicines, there is no primary medical care and outpatient care, then at least three times everyone is vaccinated in a circle, and epidemics will still mow down the population. No measles - diphtheria, the epidemic of which Dr. Komarovsky predicted, or the usual flu will mow down. According to the Public Health Center, from May 13 to May 19, the influenza epidemic continued there again, one person died, and 97.8 thousand Ukrainians fell ill (68% of whom are children). The epidemic has been going on there non-stop since last September and is in no hurry to pump up.
2485	42	And here we finish a wonderful story about our neighbors and begin to draw conclusions. You can, of course, laugh and poke your finger: yes, post-Maidan Ukraine is generally different in that it brings any problem to the point of absurdity. But it’s not worth laughing for sure - we are going there, just a little slower. We have the same “optimization”, or, more simply, deprivation of the population of medical care, which is officially confirmed by Rosstat.
2485	44	And exactly the same as in the square, there is no criminal liability for vaccine manufacturers and those who use them, it is somehow forgotten that vaccinations are, first of all, a business that brings in billions. There is also no public control of the vaccination process by parents. It all comes down to believing in the “honest noble word” of officials that everything is tested and safe. Moreover, to say that Russian officials lobbying for vaccination are somehow different from their Ukrainian counterparts, you need to have a lot of optimism. The officials of the Ministry of Health - even more so. And the fact that we have not yet “exploded” is a matter of time: the most literate parents are already picketing across the country against forced vaccination http://katyusha.org/view?id=12112.
2486	4	Russia needs a vaccine against the decaying cultural epidemic of the West
2486	5	"The rapid spread of the ideology of ""Black lives matter"" from the United States throughout the West has shown that Russia needs immunity from foreign socio-cultural trends, cultural and civilizational inoculation from this and other epidemics..."
2486	8	Federal news agency
2486	10	"The rapid spread of the ideology of ""Black lives matter"" from the United States throughout the West has shown that Russia needs the most serious immunity from foreign socio-cultural trends, cultural and civilizational inoculation from this and other similar epidemics."
2486	12	It is the presence of such immunity that is a characteristic feature of civilization as such. When you, on the one hand, have a certain influence on others - “soft power”, as they say now. On the other hand, you are immune from foreign influence. When you have both factors and at the same time there are certain economic and strategic resources to strengthen all this, only then can you put forward a claim to the status of civilization.
2486	14	"However, it is difficult to achieve such immunity for Russia because of the work of the ""agents"" - I do not mean the fifth column, but literally the actors who are the bearers of modern Western trends. They understand that in our country it is easier for representatives of the intellectual class to break through to the top and assert their own position, being just such an “agent” of left-wing socio-cultural changes coming from the West."
2486	16	Simply put, if I now start preaching modern Western ideas, showing that, unlike many in Russia, I know them very well, and, moreover, I am in contact with the creators of these ideas in the West, then my status here will rise sharply. If I become, say, a herald of the “Black Lives Matter” movement in Russia, then simply from the mere fact that I am a quality translator of these ideas, I can already become a significant person in the Russian cultural community.
2486	18	Boris Mezhuev: Russia needs a vaccine against the epidemic of cultural trends from the West
2486	20	Federal news agency
2486	22	"This is a fact, and nothing can be done about it yet. It is clear that such a state of affairs will attract young people interested in modern Western life. Not because in our country it all has some basis, but because people who present themselves as ""agents"" of Western trends have great influence here. Some of them are more talented, some less, but their role will always be big."
2486	24	"Accordingly, this provides some resource in relation to the internal Russian alignment. Let's say I have no position, but I am a supporter of racial or gender consciousness. And already I, as the bearer of the ""advanced"" ideology, have a resource for resisting the bureaucracy, including in scientific and educational organizations, within which I am."
2486	26	And it's a huge resource. There will be a large number of young and not necessarily young people who will certainly take advantage of it. It is we who have a “conservative inoculation”, based on our historical experience, primarily in the 1990s. And a fair number of young people have nothing of the sort. For them, making themselves a tool in the fight against the existing Russian structures, which are in a very immutable state, is a natural form of career development.
2486	28	How to resist this?
2486	30	Federal news agency
2486	32	We need an element of conservative education. We need a serious infrastructure that would reveal the genesis of these Western ideas, demonstrate their place in the modern life of the West, talk about the foundations on which Russian culture and life should be based, and why the blind borrowing of modern Western cultural trends is stupid and destructive. And why do you need something else.
2486	34	It is clear that some cultural changes must also take place in Russia, but they must proceed from some other logic, other principles and foundations. After all, the reasons that are offered by the West, in fact, do not lead to anything good.
2486	36	"There should be many such centers of conservative education, they should be independent, preserve freedom of expression and at the same time not run around in search of Western grants. This is difficult to do, because the Russian government, like any government, if it supports someone, seeks to manage it. Therefore, it is desirable that these centers have a university character, at least be associated with universities and have a certain intellectual autonomy. Then the people who represent this conservative enlightenment would not be afraid of reproaches that they are ""a tool of political propaganda."""
2486	38	"This was once achieved in England and was called ""Victorianism"" when the English universities began to play this kind of role. This was done at one time in Kaiser Germany, and then in the Weimar Republic, when the role of universities rose sharply and they turned into truly independent centers of intellectual enlightenment. To some extent, this was also the case in America, at least in the best years of the development of this country - until the postmodernism that came from Europe broke the foundations of cultural education in the United States, largely created according to German traditions."
2486	40	So there are positive examples, and I think that this could also be done in Russia. Because political propaganda will not play any role. After all, if the agents of Western cultural trends are confronted by people who understand that they are forced to check every word with their superiors, whether university or political, then, of course, this will not lead to anything good.
2486	42	Of course, such universities can be built on other foundations, in a kind of technotronic form, with a YouTube channel and TV access, and have all the abilities and opportunities for technological development. Then Russia will really be able to slip through the difficult period when this whole wave will come to us. Otherwise, our country will be influenced by Western trends, which, moreover, will acquire a pseudomorphic character in our country, as happened with Marxism, that is, they will be implemented taking into account certain specifics. Or they will even advance here for the uncritical Europeanization of Russia.
2487	3	From whom do Gunzburg and the center of Gamaleya buy the vaccine in bulk for rubles and dollars?
2487	4	The REGNUM news agency analyzed the activities of the Gamaleya center and found the most curious details that raise very uncomfortable questions for this center and its head, Alexander Gintsburg...
2487	7	Gunzburg and the center of Gamaleya: from whom do they buy the vaccine in bulk for rubles and dollars?
2487	9	Author - Anastasia Stepanova
2487	11	The controversial comments of Alexander Gintsburg, the head of the Gamaleya Research Center, which is the developer and one of the manufacturers of the Gam-Kovid-Vak (Sputnik V) vaccine, are already being compared with the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. In December 2020, Gunzburg ambitiously said that Sputnik V would create immunity from the infection of the 21st century for two years, in April 2021 he also expressed hope for lifelong immunity after vaccination, and already in June, the head of the Gamaleya center announced that he would be vaccinated needed every six months. So all the same: will there be protection for six months, a year, two years or for life? This is a question not only of the epidemic well-being of the Russian Federation, but also of huge money, an astronomical margin for some.
2487	13	REGNUM analyzed government orders from the Gamaleya Center and discovered a most curious thing: a government institution, which is listed not only as a developer, but also as a manufacturer of a vaccine, in 2020-2021 acted as a customer (!!!) for about 30 government contracts with a certain “single supplier” for the production of tens of millions of doses of Sputnik V. The total amount of these transactions in the summer of this year crossed the mark of 113.6 billion rubles, and at least three of them were for very decent amounts in foreign currency. But the supplier himself does not appear in open sources and is not disclosed.
2487	15	So who is producing the Gamaleya Center-branded vaccine? Interesting details about the center of Gamaleya are in the material of the news agency REGNUM.
2487	17	About the vaccine and the Gamaleya Center
2487	19	The registration certificate for the Gam-Kovid-Vak vaccine (trademark Sputnik V) was issued on August 11, 2020. It is called the world's first registered vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. The developer is the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of Russia.
2487	21	Since 1999, the Center has been headed by Alexander Gintsburg, who will turn 70 in November 2021. It is known from open sources that Gunzburg graduated from the Faculty of Biology and Soil Science of Moscow State University and is a doctor of biological sciences. He has been working in the center of Gamaleya since 1982. According to TASS, since 2000, he has been simultaneously head of the Department of Infectology of the Medical and Preventive Faculty of Postgraduate Professional Education of the Moscow Medical Academy. I. M. Sechenov. He is on the Sputnik V vaccine development team.
2487	23	TASS notes that Gunzburg's daughter and wife also work (or worked) in Gamaleya. Meanwhile, the spouse does not appear in the declaration of income of the head of the center for 2020.
2487	25	Alexander Gunzburg's income for the pandemic year amounted to 18,352,730.37 rubles (an average of about 1.5 million rubles per month) against 7,712,177.36 rubles in 2019. An increase of almost two and a half times.
2487	27	"By the way, on July 13, 2021, the Gamaleya Center signed a contract worth 9,573,600 rubles for the purchase of an Audi A8L 45 AUDI AG car. It is described on the auto dealer website as ""a more luxurious version of the A8 executive sedan."" Do you quickly get used to good things?"
2487	30	Are they arguing about timing?
2487	32	In December 2020, Alexander Gintsburg, on the air of Soloviev LIVE, commenting on the terms of protection, stated that the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine creates immunity for two years, while the Pfizer drug for three to four months: “I can this is only a guess, experimental data are needed. As for our vaccine, the platform on which it was created, the Ebola vaccine was created on it, and there is experimental data proving that a similar vaccine preparation provides protection for at least two years, maybe more. .
2487	34	In April 2021, the same Gunzburg: “I have a hope that the vaccine will work not for a year or two, but for life. Injected twice, well, live there - five, ten years, longer. As I say, I will leave my antibodies in my will to my descendants.
2487	36	And again he is the same, but already at the end of June 2021: “Currently, it is necessary to vaccinate, as it is now written in all the instructional documents of the Ministry of Health - and it is written quite correctly - every six months.”
2487	38	In October 2021, he specified that vaccination with the Sputnik V two-component vaccine and subsequent revaccination with the nasal form of the drug would most likely protect not only from the severe consequences of the course of COVID-19, but also from coronavirus infection in general.
2487	40	If you do not delve into the scientific and medical side of the issue, then the frequency of revaccination is still quite a utilitarian question: “How much?” How much and how often billions of rubles from the budget will be spent.
2487	42	The Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation estimated the expenses of the regions on measures to prevent the consequences of coronavirus infection in 2020 at the level of 1,093.6 billion rubles. During the same year, the country's regional budget deficit was estimated at 811.1 billion rubles.
2487	44	Government contracts Gamaleya
2487	46	To calculate the approximate cost of vaccines, let's turn to the data from the stopcoronavirus website. rf, which states that 50,960,796 people have been fully vaccinated. It is worth recalling that the lion's share in this volume falls on Sputnik V.
2487	48	At the end of February 2021, the Russian government announced a reduction in purchase prices for vaccines from 1.9 thousand rubles to 850-870 rubles for two components. Thus, the cost of vaccines with such inputs (including 50.9 million vaccinated) should be about 43.826 billion rubles. But here’s what’s interesting: back in May 2021, in the publication of Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation stated that the volumes of the coronavirus vaccine produced had already cost the budget almost 60 billion rubles. Such discrepancies are somewhat confusing. Especially against the backdrop of mandatory vaccination and a developed aggressive campaign against citizens who do not want to be vaccinated.
2487	50	REGNUM news agency, using data from the Government Expenditure project of the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, analyzed the contracts of the Gamaleya center from 2020 worth 1 million rubles or more, which concerned the development and production of a vaccine, and found out an interesting detail.
2487	52	"The center, which is listed as the manufacturer of the Sputnik V vaccine, in 2020-2021 acted as a customer (!!!) of about 30 state contracts for “performance of work on the production of the drug Gam-COVID-Vac”. All contracts were signed under the ""purchase from a single supplier"" scheme, but the supplier was not disclosed."
2487	54	Three agreements were concluded in foreign currency. Their total cost is 30.18 million US dollars (about 2.12 billion rubles). For example, on July 10, 2021, a contract was signed for $15.6 million and 1 million doses.
2487	56	The largest ruble contract was concluded on July 30, 2021 for the amount of 33,500,322,296.64 rubles and 34,839,120 doses, that is, about 961.5 rubles per dose at a selling price for the Sputnik V vaccine approved by the government of the Russian Federation at the level of 866 rubles 81 kopecks for two components.
2487	58	"In 2021, with the same single but unknown supplier, there were contracts for 17.3 billion rubles, 9.6 billion rubles, 9.04 billion rubles, as well as four contracts in the region of 7-7.7 billion rubles, and so on. At the same time, information about all contracts is ""absent"" on the website zakupki.gov.ru."
2487	60	Based on the analysis of procurement, it can be concluded that during these two years, the Gamaleya Center purchased millions of doses of vaccine from a third party.
2487	62	It is noteworthy that the center itself, under the control of Gunzburg, acted as a supplier under contracts for the same vaccine, that is, it actually resold it to various regional state institutions and departments? For example, on August 12, 2021, he signed a contract for 47,674,500 rubles with FKU TsBIT EMERCOM of Russia. According to it, the Gamaleya center undertook to supply 50,000 doses of Gam-COVID-Vak at a price of 953.49 rubles per dose (above the selling price approved by the Russian government).
2487	64	But here is a nuance. If we consider official tenders over the past couple of years, then such parties as the Gamaleya center purchased, it did not sell through competitive deliveries. These millions of doses were sold without public procurement?
2487	66	According to the Gamaleya Center’s cash flow report, in 2020, income from investment operations amounted to over 12.274 billion rubles against 90.8 million rubles a year earlier, of which from the sale of medicines and products used for medical purposes - 12.258 billion rubles 83.8 million rubles in 2019.
2487	68	It would not be superfluous to recall that, in addition to the center of Gamaleya, there are six other legal entities officially producing Sputnik V: Binnopharm JSC (Zelenograd), Generium JSC (Vladimir Region), R-Pharm JSC (Yaroslavl Region), Biocad CJSC (St. Petersburg), LEKKO Pharmaceutical Company CJSC (Vladimir Region), Pharmstandard-Ufimsky Vitamin Plant OJSC (Bashkiria). At the same time, at least three of them are interconnected and lead to a major businessman, a person on the Forbes list - Viktor Kharitonin (the founder of the Pharmstandard holding).
2487	70	In open data, the main shareholder of Pharmstandard is the Cypriot company AUGMENT INVESTMENTS LIMITED. Kharitonin is called her beneficiary.
2487	72	Oligarch Kharitonin is connected by open sources with the ex-Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, the former Deputy Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Viktor Khristenko, the spouse of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, who is the head of the headquarters for the control of a new coronavirus infection in the Russian Federation.
2487	74	"So, for example, the former deputy Khristenko for the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Andrei Reus, together with Kharitonin, is on the board of directors of OTCPharm from the Pharmstandard division. And Reus, Golikova and Khristenko, along with a number of other persons, are the founders of the charitable foundation ""Fund for the Revival of the Staritsky Holy Assumption Monastery."""
2487	76	Golikova's stepson, Vladimir Khristenko, is also the founder and president of the Nanolek pharmaceutical company, which plans to produce a second vaccine, KoviVac. The owner of Nanolek LLC is the Cypriot company NANOLEK HOLDING LIMITED, among the ultimate controlling persons of which, at the end of December 2020, Andrey Reus, already known to us, was named.
2487	78	Scandals, incidents and inspections
2487	80	In July 2021, the Novye Izvestia newspaper published a photo report from the pride of Russian science, the center of Gamaleya, showing the devastation that shocked readers. But, judging by the contracts of the center, he is by no means in poverty - a representative car for 10 million rubles, flights of business class employees to Paris, Conakry and back to Moscow. And the traces of the fire in 2013 in one of the buildings did not have enough money to eliminate?
2487	82	This fire deserves a special mention. He is like a vivid illustration of the process inside the luminary of science.
2487	84	From the materials of one court case, it is known that the Gamaleya center had an agreement with NPK Vector LLC for the maintenance and technical repair of the gas equipment of the institute's buildings, as well as the building in which the chemical laboratory is located. On November 5 and November 8, 2013, employees of the Gamaleya Center complained about the smell of gas to the contractor. The third call came on November 12, 2013. As follows from the materials of the same case, an employee of the contracting company “began to check the possibility of gas leakage by turning the burners on and off with a lighter, that is, a source of open fire” and “as a result of these actions, an explosion occurred in the laboratory room, followed by a fire, in as a result of which the premises and the equipment located in it completely burned out, and the employees of LLC NPK Vector received burns. The fire was extinguished by the forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
2487	86	If in this case it can be said that the contractor is at fault, then subsequent inspections showed that the Gamaleya Center itself is not very disciplined in terms of fire safety.
2487	88	"For example, during an inspection in July 2020, the Main Directorate of the Russian Emergencies Ministry for Moscow found that at least “protective structures do not meet fire safety requirements,” and in January 2019 the same agency identified fire safety violations in other buildings. As a result, in one of the buildings, it was ordered to remove gas pipelines in the corridors, and to equip the premises at a number of addresses with an automatic fire alarm system and smoke detectors. It was clarified that in one of the buildings ""the installation of gas cylinders on the evacuation routes was allowed."" The documentation also notes that ""the head of the organization does not ensure the elimination of damage to thick-layer sprayed compositions, fire-retardant coatings, plasters, cladding with slabs, sheets and other fire-retardant materials."""
2487	90	There were claims against the center of Gamaleya and other supervisory authorities.
2487	92	"So, in November 2019, the department of Rospotrebnadzor found that in a number of laboratories “there is no division into “clean” and “infectious” zones. And the interregional department No. 1 of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency in the same period revealed that “after the reconstruction, the project for the organization of the sanitary protection zone was not developed, the size of the sanitary protection zone, taking into account the results of the examination of the project of the sanitary protection zone, as well as field quality studies atmospheric air, measurements of physical impact levels are not defined, not established. The attitude towards people is also illustrated by the result of the audit of the department No. 1 of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency of March 2020. Then they checked the fulfillment of obligations under the act of December 2019, but, alas, four months later, “the legal entity of the Federal State Budgetary Institution “NITsEM them. N.F. Gamalei ""of the Ministry of Health of Russia did not fulfill its obligation to suspend the operation of equipment for cooling water at night: a dry cooling tower, a hydromodule (building No. 10 (building 8) with an annex for the production of BCG vaccine), which is a source of noise exceeding the maximum permissible levels (MPL) in apartments of houses located in close proximity to the FGBU territory."
2488	3	"So, ""win"", ""myzdobuly"" and all that! On February 25, in Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime, vaccination with a “cloudy” drug from India began. At least, this is what Ukrainian doctors and deputies themselves call the vaccine of the Indian Pharmacological Institute Serum Institute. ""The epic with the corona vaccine,"
2488	5	"So, ""win"", ""myzdobuly"" and all that! On February 25, in Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime, vaccination with a “cloudy” drug from India began. At least, this is what Ukrainian doctors and deputies themselves call the vaccine of the Indian Pharmacological Institute Serum Institute."
2488	7	“The epic with the coronavirus vaccine, which smoothly turned from a US/Swiss vaccine into a muddy Indian one, will clearly end in criminal cases. But after the change of power. In the meantime, we can once again state the loss of subjectivity by the state of Ukraine, which, like a colony, lobbyists have obliged to purchase the vaccine through the British purchasing agency Crown Agents. The purchase is organized from the former British colony in India through controlled pharmaceutical plants. Moreover, judging by the publications of the British BBC, the Indians were supposed to carry out the third stage of testing the vaccine in February on Indian citizens. But, apparently, they decided first on the Ukrainians. Who will also pay for it, ”commented the people’s deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Alexander Dubinsky on the start of vaccination in Ukraine.>>
2488	9	Olena Yakymenko, Director of the Department of Health of the Odessa City Council, said that many health workers began to have health problems after being vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Indian Covishield vaccine.
2488	11	<<“On February 25, 60 medical workers were vaccinated… 22 vaccinated patients had a reaction in the form of an increase in temperature — from 37.2 to 38.5 degrees, a deterioration in their general condition… 26 hospital employees refused vaccination for various reasons… The next day, employees were vaccinated city ​​clinical hospital No. 5 - out of 67 people, only 27 were vaccinated, ”she said.>>
2488	13	Information from Zaporozhye can be added to the statement of the Odessa doctor: there, after receiving the Covishield vaccine, the ambulance doctor's hand failed, the temperature rose and confusion arose. Complain of health problems and other ambulance workers who have been given this vaccine.
2488	15	Igor Volchenko, Deputy Director of the Department of Health of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said that about half of the health workers who were on the list of priorities for vaccination refuse to be vaccinated due to the poor quality of the drug.
2488	17	But the situation for doctors is not the worst. The maximum that the chief doctors and officials can threaten them with if they refuse to inject themselves with an untested vaccine is dismissal, and this practice is common in Ukraine. It is better to be out of a job than to become disabled for life or die while trying a new drug. None of the vaccines existing in the world has yet passed the full cycle of tests and can not be considered safe.
2488	18	"Things are much worse for Ukrainian militants in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) zone. The commanders are forcing the personnel to be vaccinated with the Indian vaccine, and this has already brought ""brilliant"" results. The Indian vaccine did what the defenders of Donbass did not have time to do - two fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were “liquidated” by their commanders and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky ... with the help of the Covishield vaccine."
2488	20	Ivan Filiponenko, an officer of the press service of the LPR People's Militia Department, reported about non-combat losses of the enemy:
2488	22	<<“The fears of military personnel in the JFO zone, who expressed their unwillingness to be vaccinated with a drug not recommended for use by the World Health Organization, were justified. So, only in the first three days of vaccination, two deaths were recorded.
2488	24	In the 10th separate motorized infantry battalion of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade, a Biglitz soldier, born in 1995, died of acute heart failure, whom the battalion commander Zworykin, under the threat of dismissal, forced to be vaccinated, despite suffering from hypertension.
2488	26	"Here is the moral: if the 25-year-old Biglitz soldier had not gone to the Donbass to kill peaceful (co-)citizens, he would have remained alive. No one ""in civilian life"" would force him to be vaccinated. One can understand the commanders from whom their commanders demand to fulfill the vaccination plan: dead soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not get sick and do not transmit the infection. But we are not talking about war, but about vaccination."
2488	28	To prick or not to prick? That is the question!
2488	29	The vaccine is always administered to a healthy person, it will only hurt the sick. And the issue of vaccination should not be considered in the plane of “death from a disease or vaccination”, but in the context of “is it worth risking the health of a person who may not get sick at all?” It is very important to be aware of this and not to succumb to the hysteria dispersed in the media on the topic “quickly inject or we will all die!”
2488	31	There is a growing mistrust around the world of hastily made vaccines that BigPharma's leaders are dumping on the market without a full cycle of testing. So, for example, in Germany, doctors and ordinary citizens massively refuse to take the British-Swedish AstraZeneca vaccine due to dangerous post-vaccination consequences. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has refused to take AstraZeneca's vaccine amid growing criticism of the drug.
2488	33	"The American pharmaceutical company Pfizer can already ""boast"" of its own cemetery of a thousand souls - the victims of its untested vaccine. The number of serious complications for the health of patients has long been in the tens of thousands."
2488	35	Under these conditions, Poland and even South Africa refused to use the already purchased millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and in recent weeks there have been persistent rumors that Ukraine will buy this vaccine from them.
2488	36	Most people who have already taken the vaccine did so either because of media hysteria or, to a greater extent, under pressure from the employer. And a very narrow stratum of the population is vaccinated for the sake of international travel. Representatives of the elites are not vaccinated at all - they use immunomodulatory drugs, and only when necessary.
2488	38	A number of experts believe that vaccination against SARS (coronaviruses are classified as SARS) is generally useless due to the high variability of the pathogen: by the time the vaccine is ready, a completely different strain will dominate. BigPharma is also going to make money on this: the head of Johnson & Johnson, Alex Gorsky, said in an interview with CNBC that “over the next few years, people will have to be vaccinated against coronavirus annually due to the emergence of new mutations.”
2488	40	"AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine uses so-called vector technology and is a genetically modified virus that infects the body and makes changes to the RNA that the immune system must respond to. The licensed Indian ""clone"" of AstraZeneca - Covishield is based on the same principle. It also infects the body and poses a threat to the life and health of the patient. Healthy patient!"
2488	42	"""Small business"" agent MI-6"
2488	43	It is expected that 500,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine will be delivered to Ukraine. Until now, no one in the world has bought this vaccine. According to the BBC, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Seychelles, Myanmar and Nepal received the vaccine free of charge for clinical trials in their populations. The first to decide to purchase this British-Indian vaccine (in fact, an experimental drug) was in Ukraine.
2488	45	The All India Drug Action Network, a patient advocacy group, believes that approval of the vaccine may have been rushed and the decision was made before the completion of interim studies on the effectiveness of the Covishield vaccine. This means that a global experiment is being carried out on the citizens of Ukraine in the interests of British investors of an Indian pharmaceutical company.
2488	47	The State Register of Medicines states that the Covishield vaccine is produced in India and supplied to Ukraine through Grace of God LLC. The company was registered in Kyiv only three months ago, and its authorized capital is 28 thousand hryvnias. Its founder is Kumar Pranaav. The main activity of the company is wholesale trade in pharmaceutical products, as well as trade in vegetables, fruits and meat.
2488	49	Why did comedian President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky ban the licensing of Russian drugs, including immunomodulatory drugs that relieve dangerous COVID-19 syndromes, but buy an untested Indian vaccine?
2488	51	With Russian medical products, everything is clear: the Western masters of the Kyiv regime will not understand such a “spite”. But why didn’t Zelensky buy the AstraZeneca vaccine from his “partners” from Poland? After all, even Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal said that “Kyiv expects to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine against the COVID-19 coronavirus from Poland in the near future.”
2488	53	It’s all about the last year’s visit of the head of Ukraine to the UK, after which the “president” Zelensky himself told how he spent several hours in the MI-6 office, which is actually equal to recognition in cooperation with foreign intelligence and treason.
2488	55	Like a real British agent, he puts the interests of the mother country, and hence the British business, at the forefront. So President Zelensky sent the money of Ukrainian taxpayers into the pockets of British investors in an Indian pharmaceutical company, and he “respected” not only the manufacturer, but also intermediaries from Albion - the British purchasing agency Crown Agents. The Poles stayed with the useless AstraZeneca purchased from the British, not because Zelensky cares about the health of citizens, but because the Poles have already paid the British for the vaccine. If you buy the vaccine from the Poles, the money will go to the Poles, and the British curators of the Ukrainian president believe that only they should get the money of the colony, which is why they “recommended” the colony manager to buy the vaccine ... also from them, but in the version for the natives.
2488	56	But that's not all. The Minister of Health of Ukraine Maxim Stepanov wrote on his Facebook page that the same Serum Institute will supply Ukraine with 5 million doses of the NovaVax coronavirus vaccine. In total, its purchases are expected in the amount of 15 million doses. The start of deliveries is July 2021.
2488	58	It is unfortunate that ordinary citizens of Ukraine will pay with their lives and health for the “profitable” deals of Ukrainian politicians and British businessmen from BigPharma. The British are well aware that the “Ukrainians” are Russians with a changed historical and ideological code, who, with the exception of 10-15% of the “stoned” Nazis, will be able to become loyal and useful citizens of Novorossia and Russia, and therefore they try to kill and make them as disabled as possible. number. Therefore, it is important that our readers, who have relatives and friends in Ukraine, warn them about the dangers of vaccines by Zelensky and his British partners. Fear the Britons who bring gifts!
2489	1	Sweet, false tales of Ukrainian propaganda for suckers
2489	3	This article is an answer to the questions of some commentators who wonder why there is so much delusional chaff in the minds of an ordinary Ukrainian resident, and who doubt the mass nature of this phenomenon. Like, there is nothing to judge the great and wise Ukrainian people by a few individuals you personally met. And it is not necessary to judge the whole of Ukraine by the pearls they issue. Moreover, Russian authors and publicists take these pearls from the ceiling.
2489	5	"No. Not from the ceiling, but from a Ukrainian zomboyaschik who has been intensively pouring nonsense into the heads of the inhabitants of the former Ukrainian SSR for 33 years now, starting with the People’s Movement of Ukraine, which since 1987 began to actively broadcast about “Slavic France” and about the fact that “Muscovites ate our fat."""
2489	7	Moreover, today these pearls are by no means voiced on the Porokhobot channels, but on the most oppositional and, according to polls, enjoying great authority. Information coming from the air of these TV channels (ZIK, 112 Ukraine, NewsOne) is recognized by the population of the former Ukrainian SSR as truthful as possible. This is where the non-existent Ukrainian greatness and the Ukrainian arrogance inflated to universal proportions come from in the mass consciousness of the citizens of Ukraine. It is worth immediately warning the reader that he may be familiar with some examples from my previous articles, but, as they say, repetition is the mother of learning.
2489	9	"1. The first statement: ""Zelensky is the No. 1 actor in the CIS."" Author - Dmitry Spivak. TV channels: 112 Ukraine, NewsOne."
2489	11	The above character said this on these TV channels repeatedly (starting from the moment of inauguration and ending around the middle of summer 2020), exactly until he began to criticize the president-comedian. Again, it must be said that Spivak was just a broadcaster and expressed not only his own, as it turned out, opinion. He was echoed by his numerous co-hosts, invited experts and interlocutors answering his questions via phone and video calls.
2489	13	"Is Zelensky really No. 1 actor in the CIS? Let's figure it out. It is clear that Zelensky is not the No. 1 actor in Russia and never has been. But what do we care about “totalitarian” Russia and its EurAsEC satellite countries? Much more important is what the global cultural community will say! And what? In the late nineties and throughout the 2000s, the most famous post-Soviet actors in Hollywood were Alexander Baluev, Vladimir Mashkov, Oleg Taktarov and a little Lev Durov. This information is taken from numerous Los Angeles ratings. It is not from the ceiling, lovers of English-language sites can check for themselves. Lev Durov, by the way, played in the blockbuster ""The Price of Fear"" along with Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, Ciarán Hinds and many other famous Hollywood performers, so Vladimir Alexandrovich still has to jump and jump to the old ""soviet"" actor. I generally keep quiet about Baluev and Mashkov. But “that is…”."
2489	15	And who is given preference ratings now? There is no unequivocal favorite post-Soviet actor, as different Hollywood publications and near-bohemian tabloids reflect different points of view, but most of all give preference to Konstantin Khabensky, Olga Kurylenko, Danila Kozlovsky and the late Anton Yelchin. Let's agree that the conditional Ukrainians Mila Kunis and Milla Jovovich should initially be left alone, as, indeed, Yelchin. Personally, I do not think that Yelchin is a Russian actor, he moved to the West at a fairly early age and naturalized. Kurylenko is also a citizen of France, moreover, she publicly renounced her Ukrainian roots, saying that she was predominantly of Russian and Polish blood. But this is not even about that, my dear readers. As you can see, there is no Zelensky at the top of numerous Hollywood ratings, which reflect the most famous actors of the former USSR, and never has been. This is also proved by numerous publications in the Western media, which wrote that a Ukrainian comedian became president. Feel the difference? Not a very famous actor, not a world famous actor, but just a Ukrainian comedian. You can put an end to this.
2489	17	Verdict: lies, and impudent, having nothing to do with reality.
2489	19	"2. The second statement: ""Ukrainian cinema is cinema No. 1 on the territory of the CIS countries."" Author - Dmitry Spivak. TV channels: 112 Ukraine, NewsOne."
2489	21	"It's generally past. It is worth noting that the author of this statement clearly had in mind the film production, filmed with the participation of the 95th quarter and Zelensky personally. Like, this automatically makes these comedy films the best in the expanses of the former USSR. I will upset him. Not only that, not a single film has been made in Ukraine that would be widely shown in the Western box office. Another significant fact is that the highest-grossing Ukrainian films were created in cooperation with the aggressor country. And Russian films and cartoons are shown all over the world, even those that came out after 2014, when the whole world, according to Svidomo, was ""together with Ukraine."""
2489	23	"These are such cartoons as ""Masha and the Bear"" and ""Smeshariki"", films ""T-34"", series ""Major"" and many other projects. And this year, Netflix will broadcast on its portal the Russian series Epidemic in the original, without adaptation. Yes, ours is far from the rental figures of foreign competitors, and the quality of the cinematographic product must definitely be tightened up, get rid of the “kino-cranberries” of the Russian variety, but still our product in the world ratings is unequivocally quoted above the trash that is produced by Ukraine."
2489	25	It's interesting about the box office. In 2019, in Russia, domestic films only in cinemas collected 12.3 billion rubles, at that time 183 million dollars, to this figure must be added 52.4 million dollars in box office receipts abroad. It is also necessary to add to this 17.1 billion rubles that online cinemas have earned, of which 68 percent is a regular subscription and a one-time purchase of a Russian product, which is another 173 million dollars. In general, we get 408 million dollars. It is very weak for such a country, one box-office film from the USA will surpass it at a time.
2489	27	But what about Ukraine? The box office of domestic cinema in Ukraine and abroad in 2019 amounted to $7.9 million. To this should be added approximately 5.6 million revenues of Ukrainian Internet sites from subscriptions and one-time paid viewing of Ukrainian film products. Total $13.5 million for all of 2019. If this is the bottom in Russia, then in Ukraine it is the bottom of the bottom.
2489	29	Verdict: statements about the great Ukrainian cinema are the same rabid lies as about actor No. 1.
2489	31	"3. The third statement: """"95 quarter"" is the most famous and successful humorous project in the CIS."" Author - Dmitry Spivak. TV channels: 112 Ukraine, NewsOne."
2489	33	"Yes of course! Excuse me, please, but where did you put the Comedy Club? Both in popularity and in terms of money, they are ahead of the well-known, but still small-town Ukrainian project called ""95 Quarter"", whose revenue is approximately $ 10 million a year, according to the statements of Yevgeny Chervonenko, Andriy Bohdan and many other people close to Ben Kolomoisky . I am not a fan of the Comedy Club, but they constantly go on tour to Western Europe and the USA, and they definitely have more spin-projects than the ""quarters"". And this means that the Russian humorous project also has definitely more money and popularity in the coveted West, and not only in the CIS. According to the Kommersant newspaper, back in 2013, the brand's revenue exceeded $90 million, and at the time of 2019, show business experts estimate it at about $230 million a year. This is due to the fact that the brand has a lot of very profitable spin-projects, as I mentioned above."
2489	35	I have a question: maybe by fame and popularity, the Ukrainian “political gamer” means something else besides annual revenue and popularity abroad?
2489	37	Verdict: lies, poured with the same sauce as the previous two statements.
2489	39	"4. Fourth statement: ""Thanks to such a holding as UkrLandFarming, Ukraine is the undisputed leader in the Eastern European market for the production of chicken eggs."" Author - Dmitry Spivak. TV channel ""112 Ukraine""."
2489	41	I have already dealt with this statement. It should be noted that in the world ranking for the production of chicken eggs, Russia ranks sixth, and Ukraine is not even in the top ten. And, contrary to the opinion of some “trans-Ukrainian” commentators, your humble servant does not go and specifically interview Ukrainian workers, these questions arise spontaneously.
2489	43	Where did this one come from? I answer. Once, in the early spring of this 2020, I and several other engineering and technical workers were sent to purchase food (money and guest workers must be controlled, otherwise you never know) along with Ukrainian workers who wished to prepare their own provisions. We had to go to the department where chicken eggs were exhibited, since our wards were pretty late there. It turns out that they were looking for eggs of Ukrainian origin. To my question: “What can Ukrainian eggs do here?” - they answered: “But what about, Ukraine is the first in the production of eggs, all Russians eat Ukrainian eggs.”
2489	45	"I'm not exaggerating anything. He asked why they decided that. Yeah, the program ""Fish Day"" with Dmitry Spivak on the TV channel ""112 Ukraine"", everything is clear."
2489	47	"Verdict: an outright lie, designed to give a political coloring to the ""collision"" of NABU, and in fact the Americans, on Bakhmatyuk's holding. The purpose of the “arrival” was the formation of a supervisory board with foreign participation as part of the holding. Of course, it is clear to experts and a sophisticated viewer what is behind all this, but a peresic Ukrainian believes in this nonsense."
2489	49	"5. Fifth statement: “Ukrainian IT industry is the most advanced in the territory of the CIS countries” Author – Evgeny Chervonenko. TV channel ""112 Ukraine""."
2489	51	"For those who don't know, Chervonenko is a former Orange Spill transport minister and Yushchenko's ally at the first Maidan in 2004. Russian-speaking, but despite this, he praises the Orange Revolution, Yushchenko and Yulia (although it would seem impossible to praise them both at the same time), boasts of connections in Europe and the United States, and constantly uses foreign economic terminology (he literally pronounces many economic terms that have specialized Russian translation into English), which positions itself as a Western-oriented ""effective manager""."
2489	53	"Recently, he scored another pearl, saying that together with the Crimea, Ukraine ""surrendered"" the most combat-ready unit of the Air Force. It’s good that, even out of habit, “the most combat-ready unit in the CIS” did not say. In general, he is constantly talking about something “advanced”, which is allegedly produced in Ukraine."
2489	55	On October 15, 2020, on the 112 Ukraine TV channel, he stated that Ukraine produces the best in the world (it is growing, however, the CIS alone is not enough!) missile guidance systems. Where are you from, bastards? But back to the IT industry.
2489	57	In the Chinese and American ratings, the Russian IT industry occupies the third position, after the USA and China, respectively. Offended Indians publish their ratings, where Russia ranks fourth in the world, after the US, India and China, respectively.
2489	59	Ukraine and Belarus, which imagined themselves to be great IT powers after the development of a small number of fairly successful game projects, I did not find in these ratings, reflecting the top ten. Only the Hacker-Rank website put Ukraine in 11th place, since the top 11 countries were published in its ranking for 2016.
2489	61	In one of my spring articles, I made only a partial comparison with Ukraine. Why partial? Because in Russia there is a full-fledged IT industry, albeit underdeveloped, but not in Ukraine. There is only its sector, represented by 150,000 programmers working for foreign companies and receiving salaries from abroad.
2489	63	But the Americans question these Ukrainian data. They claim that 150,000 are Ukrainian citizens who call themselves programmers, of which only 80,000 are actually specialists in foreign projects.
2489	65	Their annual salary, sent by foreign concerns to the territory of the non-independent, is 4 billion dollars, according to Ukrainian expert Viktor Skarshevsky.
2489	67	In Russia, there are very few freelance programmers who receive direct salaries from abroad. Basically, these are quite large companies involved in the development and subsequent maintenance (updates, patches) of antiviruses, software for mechanical engineering, software for the space industry, software for combat vehicles and military equipment, software for processing industries, software for oil and gas companies, software for power plants of all types and so on.
2489	69	It should also be noted that Russian software occupies 65 percent of the world market for marine navigation programs, despite the dominance of GPS over GLONASS so far.
2489	71	In total, the revenue of this segment of the Russian IT industry alone reaches 22 billion dollars a year. But that is not all.
2489	73	In Russia, there is also a manufacturing segment of the IT industry. Russia produces microprocessors, microcircuits, many components for Korean and Chinese smartphones, screen glasses for smartphones, and much more. That is, the finished product, however, is still on a subcontract. We still have to work and work, but all of the above Russian products of the IT industry are finished products with high added value, and not just wages.
2489	75	According to foreign experts, the annual revenue of the Russian IT industry reaches 4.7 percent. Russian GDP. Count yourself and compare with the miserable Ukrainian revenue. Yes, we do not have three or four successful video games in our portfolio, Russia simply has a different specialization, but the scale is not an example higher.
2489	77	Verdict: statements about the Ukrainian IT industry are complete nonsense, from which cockroaches in the head applaud standing.
2489	79	"6. Sixth statement: ""Ukraine is the only one among the CIS countries where the full cycle of aircraft construction with unique aviation technologies has been preserved."" Author - Evgeny Chervonenko. TV channel ""112 Ukraine""."
2489	81	As for the unique aviation technologies, I agree, about the full cycle - sheer nonsense, even the Ukrainian SSR did not possess it, up to 62 percent of the components for whose aircraft plants were supplied by the RSFSR, the Uzbek SSR, the BSSR and the Kazakh SSR. The same trend continued during the period of independence, only deliveries from Uzbekistan, which, together with the plant in Tashkent, lost its competence in the production of components, ceased.
2489	83	We will not compare helicopter production, because there is no need, in Ukraine it is generally sour, and in Russia, on average, according to Wikipedia, 200 transport and combat helicopters per year are produced only for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.
2489	85	"Since 2015, Ukraine has not produced a single aircraft, either military or civilian, due to the lack of Russian components, and the hysterics broadcasting from authoritative channels “throw” about Nenko’s aircraft building leadership in the post-Soviet space. So the brains of Ukrainian migrant workers boil when they read in the news feed ""Alternatives"" about the 202nd produced Sukhoi Superjet-100 aircraft."
2489	87	This is only one model!
2489	89	But wait, you have a war with the “aggressor”, surely it is just as hard for him? An no. Since 2014, Aggressor has produced only 208 civilian aircraft, including Sukhoi models, several MS-21s, Ilyushins and Tupolevs. And now the cherry on the cake! This number does not include small aircraft.
2489	91	Well, where is the “full cycle” and Ukrainian “leadership in the post-Soviet space”?
2489	93	"I repeat once again, I, like many Russians, do not provoke these discussions. Zarobitchans read the news feed, get upset and begin to prove to the Russians that Ukrainian planes are better. You ask, they say, where are they, Ukrainian planes? Yak de? He, ""Mriya"" litae. And all? No more? This is where the Russians' questions end."
2489	95	Verdict: all talk about the leadership of Ukrainian aviation is bullshit, but the absolute majority of Ukrainian citizens believe in this nonsense.
2489	97	"7. The seventh statement: ""Anatoly Shariy is a political blogger No. 1 in Ukraine and in the CIS countries."" The author is the Shariy Party, which fixed this statement on the campaign booklet."
2489	99	No, they are not joking. You can look at the photo of the booklet on the Internet, even Tatyana Montyan managed to joke about this statement and attached a photo of this very booklet. Shariy has 2.39 million subscribers on YouTube. The Russian Yuri Dudya has 7.8 million subscribers on the same YouTube, and 13.57 million subscribers on social networks. And what about Nikolai Sobolev with his 5.18 million subscribers on YouTube, sorry, where did you go? And Sasha Spielberg, who really interviews the owners of high offices, really participates in political debates and took part in parliamentary hearings, where? She has 6.55 million YouTube subscribers, by the way. The reader will say that they are oppositional and pro-Western, and he will be right. I am also not an adherent of the ideas that they carry to the masses. But the fact remains that Sharia is far from them in terms of popularity in the CIS, and besides, he is also pro-Western: he regularly talks about European legislation in his blogs, sets it as an example and deigns to live in this very Europe.
2489	101	Verdict: the cries about the Ukrainian blogger No. 1 is another sluggish attempt to portray the “globe of Ukraine”.
2489	103	"8. The eighth statement: ""In Belarus, as well as partially in Ukraine, unlike other CIS countries, the Semashko system is still operating."" Authors: Elena Bondarenko, Dmitry Spivak, Evgeny Chervonenko. TV channels: 112 Ukraine, NewsOne."
2489	105	These sayings of the spring period were intended to denigrate Russia as a backward country, and to elevate Belarus and Ukraine. Let me remind the reader that in the period from March to May, the great Belarusian Bulbogetman refused to introduce quarantine and intended to fight the coronavirus with vodka and a tractor, and in Ukraine the daily number of infected citizens detected was almost ten times less than in Russia.
2489	107	Sane experts understood that all this was due to the fact that the number of daily tests in Ukraine was three dozen times less than in Russia, but this, of course, is silent. There was such an idea that medicine in Russia was ruined and “Rashka” would be the first to ask the West or China for a vaccine on its knees. Now, I hope you understand where the legs grow from that skepticism about the fact that Russia has developed an effective vaccine the fastest?
2489	109	Further more. Not believing in the second wave of the pandemic, the “covid dissident,” as she calls herself, the Russophobe Elena Bondarenko, in several interviews, flaunted the fact that she constantly communicates with Ukrainian virologists and epidemiologists, implicitly hinting that they are the best in the entire post-Soviet space. This was another stone in our garden, which was supposed to show the backwardness of Russian doctors and scientists and the futility of their efforts in terms of developing a vaccine. Yes, she does not directly say this, but the subtext is obvious. But now time has passed, the wheel of genoty has turned with a crunch, and the entire Ukrainian media and expert pseudo-beau monde is mired in disputes about the possibility and expediency (and what about efficiency?) of supplying a Russian vaccine to Ukraine.
2489	111	The honored doctor, scientist and great clever (no kidding) cardiac surgeon Boris Todurov, advocating the purchase of the Russian vaccine by Ukraine, was forced to explain to the surprised Ukrainian media and expert community from television screens that these Russian pharmacological, virological and bacteriological schools are the most powerful in the world, and none are Ukrainian. And that the Ukrainian indicator in terms of the number of cases per capita has long exceeded the Russian one, and this is taking into account the fact that they do 200 thousand tests a week, according to the Minister of Health of Ukraine Stepanov, and Russia - about 2.5 million.
2489	113	But it is necessary to add a fly in the ointment to a barrel of honey. The first to volunteer was Olesya Medvedeva, a pro-European windbag who works hard at the Brussels-funded and controlled publication Strana.ua. Yes, some dear commentators that climb in defense of this person, do not hope, I will call a spade a spade. Yes, I agree, ordinary reporters and journalists may not know for whom the editor-in-chief Guzhva, who lives in Europe, and his indefatigable deputy Svetlana Kryukova are working for and whose will is being carried out. Although it is doubtful, because all media Ukraine knows about it. The main trend of this publication is the fierce opposition to the Washington mongrels of the Ukrainian spill in the UkroSMI and the regular ridicule and questioning (in case of impossibility - hushing up) even the smallest Russian successes on any front.
2489	115	"From Medvedeva, even Gazprom got it, which ""miscalculated with SP-2"", ""stupidly entered the oil war"" and so on. But now time has passed, it turns out that the leadership of the oil and gas giant is balanced and patiently pursuing a policy regarding the construction of the pipeline, and the Russian fuel and energy complex won the oil war confidently and without tension. Where is the video for this? And, I forgot: if it is impossible to ridicule and question, then this fact must be hushed up. But back to the vaccine."
2489	117	Medvedeva, in a recent video, argued that Russia lacked the capacity to produce a vaccine. She was immediately joined by a political scientist of the steampunk and rocker spill Vadim Karasev (or Karasov?), who supported this statement and added that Russia needed to build additional factories. Especially for these imbeciles, I tell you that starting from January 1, 2021, mass production will begin at least at 430 out of 480 enterprises capable of producing this vaccine. At least such plans are voiced by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
2489	119	430, Carl! Hey, Karasov, who needs to build factories? Maybe all the same you, yellow-blakytnye?
2489	121	According to the data of the same Ministry of Industry and Trade, which Denis Manturov announced in an interview, starting from January 2021, Russia will produce 15 million doses per month for the first three months. And from April, production will increase many times over, and by the end of the year more than a billion doses will be produced.
2489	123	In support of these words, I can cite the statement of Putin, who said that by August 2021, 70 percent of the Russian population, approximately 103 million, will be vaccinated. That is, by August 2021, Russia will produce more than 200 million doses for its own needs, because you need to be vaccinated twice.
2489	125	By the way, there are more than a dozen factories in Russia that can and will produce more than one and a half million doses of vaccine per month, and in total the factories will be involved, I repeat, at least 430. Of this 1 billion doses, Russia will send approximately 400 million for its own needs (300 million for vaccination, because, I repeat, you need to be vaccinated twice, and 100 - in reserve) and about 300 - to the CIS countries that submitted applications. India will use its own production, but will still buy 100 million from Russia. Brazil will also expand its production, but will also purchase 50 million. China, of course, will satisfy its own needs. The rest will be distributed to all other countries that have submitted applications.
2489	127	Hey, Ukrainian underexperts Karasev and Medvedeva, who is there lacking capacity? Yes, we are not going to save the whole world, even if the bright-faced West, which you worship, will participate in its salvation. Have you noticed that Manturov in no way announced the construction of pharmacological factories? Because there is enough capacity, despite the attempts of the “CE-Europeans” to blur the industrial and scientific successes of Russia.
2489	129	And you know what's the funniest thing? They first ridiculed Russian scientists, then the Russian vaccine itself, then Russian pharmacological production, but they will most likely be vaccinated with the Russian vaccine. The wheel of genoty - it is ...
2489	131	Verdict: another lie designed to belittle Russian medicine and science, as well as its unattainable superiority over the Ukrainian ruins of the Soviet heritage.
2489	133	Once again, I would like to repeat to readers, especially adherents of the opinion that hatred of Russia and the denial of its successes among Ukrainian, and even Belarusian guest workers, are isolated cases, this is far from being the case.
2489	135	Rostyslav Ishchenko recently on “Live with Rostislav Ishchenko” dated October 14, 2020, which was broadcast by the Ukraina.ru online publication, bluntly stated (24th minute): the majority of Ukrainian citizens believe that Russia is a big Ukraine, only there everything is much, much worse. I agree with him.
2489	137	Want more examples? Good. How do you like these: “Ukraine is the leader in the CIS in the production of confectionery”, “Ukraine is the fifth ship power in the world”? This is from a recent one. They put themselves in fifth place in shipbuilding after the USA, Britain, France and South Korea, there is no Russia there. Moreover, the real situation for 2020 is as follows: South Korea is in first place, Russia is in second, and China is in third. There is no Ukraine there.
2489	139	There are a great many examples of such schizophrenia, not only for an article, but enough for a scientific dissertation. And to all the skeptics who believe that it is only I who meet isolated cases of Ukrainian violent insanity at some construction sites, I answer: you are mistaken.
2489	141	Over the years of my work, quite a lot of gasters from Ukraine and Belarus have passed through me, and they gave out such schizophrenic pearls even before the Maidan. I first heard such things at the reconstruction of the oil refinery complex in Tobolsk in 2011. Again, construction in Russia is a very tight field of activity, I communicate with many contractors who have the same symptoms in their Svidomo wards. And the Ukrainian gasters that work as taxi drivers in the Crimea, do you know what heights of schizophrenia they master? That's the same.
2489	143	Do you want some fresh stuff? You have already read about chicken eggs above, now I will tell you the “legend of Vinnitsa cheese”. One summer, on a TV show at Solovyov’s, the unforgettable Vasyl Vakarov, who recently scored a pearl about “Naftogaz’s peremog over Gazprom,” said that under many Belarusian and some Russian labels on Russian shelves, the famous Vinnitsa cheese is hidden. Well, you all probably heard the legend about the “great Ukrainian milk”, with the products of which, after the victory of the Maidan, Svidomo were going to fill up the whole of Europe?
2489	145	Yep, they screwed up. Believing this statement, my Svidomo wards began to look for Vinnitsa cheese on the Russian shelves of large chains. Naturally, they did not find it and, as usual, they began to assert that it actually exists there, only under Russian and Belarusian labels.
2489	147	"The next time we went to the store, I led them to the counter. Prices there ranged from 280 to 450 rubles per kilogram of cheese. No brainer that these are Russian and Belarusian products. It took me two minutes to explain to the Ukrainians that in this particular shop there is no Vinnitsa cheese and cannot be. I entered the Internet from my phone, went to the Ukrainian site zakupki.com.ua, which reflects the prices of Ukrainian large retailers. For a long time I was looking for Vinnitsa cheese, more and more I came across Lviv and Radomyshl, but I found it. The cheapest was 215 hryvnia per kilogram. If it is delivered to Russia, then it is through Belarus, and this is a markup of 60 percent at least, according to knowledgeable people who say that Belarusian and Russian outbids add 30 percent each, this is without taking into account the margin of the Russian retailer. That is, we multiply 215 by 1.6 and multiply by 2.7 (the exchange rate of the ruble against the hryvnia) and we get 928 rubles per kilogram, plus or minus fifty dollars. Well, you can see from the price tag, I explained to Svidomo, that there is no Vinnitsa cheese on this counter. Is it present at all in Russia? Of course, it is present, but in small quantities and only on the shelves of specialized cheese shops that are visited by gourmets with puffy wallets. In the same shops you can find Swiss, Dutch, Italian and French cheese, and not just Ukrainian Vinnytsia cheese. This is the logical end of the legend ""about Vinnytsia cheese, which every Russian eats."""
2489	149	You ask, where do they get such confusion in their heads? I answer. They are far from stupid people, they simply can no longer distinguish true information from a deliberate fake, because for thirty-three years dill propaganda has been thoroughly saturated with Ukrainian swagger and massively infected with megalomania.
2489	151	From many conversations, I learned one thing: they unequivocally consider the information coming from the channels of Poroshenko, Akhmetov and Kolomoisky to be propaganda and for the most part do not believe it. And conditional opposition channels and conditional opposition online publications and bloggers are trusted unconditionally.
2489	153	For example, a former minister speaks on an opposition channel and says things that are pleasant for Ukraine, that its IT sector is the most developed in the post-Soviet space. The channel seems to be oppositional, it’s not just anyone who speaks, but the former minister, how can you not believe it? Conditionally opposition Internet publications (actually pro-European) broadcast about no less pleasant things: that the Russians are not doing as well as they paint. That Russian scientists are dumber than Ukrainian ones, and even if they are smarter, they still won’t develop a vaccine, and if they do, they won’t have enough production capacity, and if they do, then ... they haven’t come up with further. How can one not believe such pleasant facts voiced by opposition online publications?
2489	155	"Go ahead. They not only read the news feed ""Alternatives"", but also watch ""An Evening with Vladimir Solovyov"" and consider the facts that they learn from these sources to be unambiguously true. I'll tell you more: residents of Western Ukraine watch ""An Evening with Vladimir Solovyov"" and for the most part believe the information that they draw from there. And what do they see? It’s not just anyone who speaks on an authoritative platform, but Vasyl Vakarov, a former high-ranking official, and declares that Vinnitsa cheese is present on almost every Russian counter. Well, they would, of course, use their brains and understand that even the aggregate Ukrainian producer is not able to saturate the entire Russian market, let alone Vinnitsa. This is from the same opera as the statement that ""Belarus feeds all of Russia."" Yes, not true, but nice."
2489	157	Do you want to tell them the truth? The truth that Ukraine is the leader in the CIS in terms of GDP reduction? After all, their GDP as of 1991 in comparable figures was 353 billion dollars, and now it is just over 100. And this is not my claim, but the World Bank.
2489	159	Maybe you want to tell them that Ukraine is the undisputed leader in terms of depopulation in absolute terms in the CIS? Their population was 52 million, and now 37, according to Dubilet, and personally, like some Ukrainian experts, I believe that it is no more than 25. These conclusions are made on the basis of a decrease in the consumption of meat, milk, bread, tea and sugar.
2489	161	Maybe you want to tell them that their country is the absolute champion in deindustrialization in the CIS, having overtaken Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined in terms of the number of closed and scrapped plants?
2489	163	They do not need such a truth, just as they do not need the truth that Russia paid for its current very relative prosperity and some successes with hard work, hardships and several local conflicts. They don't need that. They need to click, and you're done! The country is in chocolate, they are in chocolate, backward Muscovites are jealous. They weren’t against Poroshenko in the presidential elections either, but they voted for this very “click” that Zelensky promised them. Each time they wait, nothing clicks, they vote for a new candidate, what this “click” will promise them.
2489	165	And how can a conditionally new candidate attract the Ukrainian electorate? That's right, tales of Ukrainian greatness and Russian backwardness. And when the candidate becomes recognizable, you can start talking about this very “click” again. And they will believe because they want to believe that it is possible to achieve success without doing anything. And besides, how can one not believe a respected person who speaks at conditionally opposition venues? He says such nice and nice things!
2489	167	"All this nonsense that I cited in eight examples is not yet the tip of the iceberg, but just preparations for local elections. What crap about Russian backwardness and Ukrainian greatness will pour from all irons when they go to early parliamentary elections, it’s scary to imagine. Will Ukrainians believe? Will. After all, then, along with the rest of the heresy, promises about the next “click” will be heard right and left. Like, vote for me, dear Terpilo ​​Baklanchenko, do not hesitate! After the victory, as soon as I snap my fingers, you will immediately find yourself in Ukrainian Switzerland, you don’t need to work hard for this, develop the country, you only need to vote for me and our party! We will live well, we will be reckoned with in the West, and the “Muscovites” will turn green with envy. And then on a new one: another deterioration in the standard of living, disappointment, a new messiah, the promise of a ""chink"", and all this is flavored with tales of Ukrainian greatness. Here is a brief illustration of the electoral cycle of the Ukraine project."
2490	3	The liberation of Ukraine from the neo-Nazi puppet regime is not really limited to military action. This is a powerful turning point in the history of Russia itself, which means its final return to the status of a great power and launches the process of internal transformations, as a result of which very soon we will see a completely different country - completely self-sufficient and independent of the West.
2490	5	The economic sanctions of the West are just as necessary to create the sovereignty of Russian civilization, as is the pushing back of the actual borders of NATO from Belgorod to the Carpathians, which is achieved only by a military operation, since the West has left Russia no other choice. Our country found itself in a desperate situation - in a strategic sense, completely similar to when the enemy stood near Moscow in December 1941. The western border of the Russian Federation actually stands on the borders of Rus' during the time of Ivan III, and in the conditions of modern warfare, this means that Moscow is almost defenseless even without the use of nuclear weapons. In this situation, every kilometer of moving to the west of the territory actually controlled by NATO is extremely important.
2490	7	If militarily the operation in Ukraine has the same significance as the counter-offensive near Moscow in 1941, then it is no less important on other fronts - economic, ideological and national. There was no other way to force the Russian economic elite to become a national elite and stop the withdrawal of capital abroad. Now the West itself will do this, even without the participation of our state. And there was no other way to complete the processes of import substitution in the most important sectors - but the sanctions will make it happen. The President of Russia and his team have found an ingenious way to complete the sovereignization of Russia by the hands of the West itself, which fears this sovereignty the most. Making the enemy fight against himself is the highest achievement of strategy. The main loss of the West from the sanctions that it imposes against Russia is measured not in dollars and euros, but in a much more valuable substance - in the loss of political and economic levers of pressure on Russia.
2490	9	"Based on this, the operation in Ukraine has the character of a Patriotic War - albeit far in scale (fortunately) from those domestic wars that Russia had to wage earlier, but its strategic and historical meaning is precisely this. This fact should be the basis of public discourse on contemporary events. As one would expect, today the public space is filled with streams of Russophobic lies and abominations, which are opposed only by the official position of Russia. In the public space, an algorithm for the destruction of Russophobic lies has not yet been developed. It is easy to destroy lies in specific situations, but this is not enough - you need to destroy its very foundation. Just as the missile forces and aviation destroyed military bases and infrastructure before the attack by the ground troops, it was also necessary to immediately destroy the arguments of the so-called ""anti-war actions"" in the public sphere. The simplest and most effective argument against them is this: “Russia is waging a war for its very existence - a domestic war. Therefore, everyone who opposes this war - opposes Russia, is her enemy and traitor. What would happen to those who would come out with the slogans “No to war!” during WWII? The question is rhetorical."
2490	11	"Argument two. In Ukraine, Russia is not waging a war against this country, but is conducting a liberation operation - just as in 1945 the Russian army took Berlin not to capture Germany, but in order to destroy Nazism. For the same purpose, the Russian army takes Kyiv in the year 2022. Unfortunately, at the moment, not only among the obvious Russophobes, but also among some ""patriots"" there are very naive people who also demand ""start negotiations as soon as possible"", ""so that blood is not shed."" These infantiles should be strongly explained that in order to really never again shed blood, you need to take Kyiv and force the Nazis to capitulate. And if this is not done, then not only those who are now fighting heroically will die in vain, but even then the war will inevitably resume and much more blood will be shed. “Blessed are the peacemakers”: but peacekeepers are those who destroy the very source of war, and not those who treacherously spit in their backs. Peacekeepers are those who storm Kyiv, and not hypocritical rear rats bleating ""No to war."" When Ukraine destroyed the Donbass in 2014, they were on its side."
2490	13	"This concerns the third, national aspect of the war. The Patriotic Wars of Russia led to a huge rise in national self-consciousness and the consolidation of the people. It will be exactly the same this time, even despite the much more modest scale of what is happening. But even they turned out to be quite enough to stir up the Russophobic viper and highlight the enemies of Russia inside the country as much as possible. Naturally, there will be no “repressions” against them, but they put the stigma of defeatists on themselves forever and they will never forget it. This is a huge step towards the cleansing of the Russian cultural, informational and educational space from the obvious and hidden enemies of Russia. However, in this matter, we cannot rely only on the state, but we should actively show civil initiative - create public organizations that would record everyone who ideologically supported the enemy and spat in the back of the Russian army during the new Patriotic War. We must not allow these people to continue to ""brainwash"" the people, occupying almost the entire information and cultural space of Russia."
2490	15	The ongoing events are consolidating the people not only within Russia itself, having drawn a clear divide between the true patriots of Russia and the “cursed non-Russians” (regardless of their nationality). Such a section already took place in 2014, but now it has become even clearer and deeper. Consolidation has now gone beyond Russia and has actually divided the entire global world into our friends and enemies. Even in the West, there were many adequate people who understand the reasons for Russia's actions. But outside the collective West, almost the entire world is actually now on the side of Russia, as it is fighting for the common cause of destroying the world dictatorship of the West and building a just world order.
2490	17	"For Orthodox people, this Fourth Patriotic War has a very definite religious and even eschatological meaning. How not to relate personally to V.V. Putin, but objectively, that is, in accordance with the Orthodox understanding of history, Russia V.V. Putin is currently waging a war against the apostasy civilization of the Antichrist, defending the very existence of Katekhon - ""holding"", which at the moment is Russia. And no matter how far from the Church the majority of the people in modern Russia may be due to the Bolshevik yoke of the 20th century, it is quite obvious that Russia as a state at the present moment has remained the last defense of Orthodoxy in the modern world. Without Russia, the rest of the Orthodox world is defenseless and doomed to a quick death, which has already begun in the form of the Bartholomew schism. The current operation also has the direct meaning of the Russian reconquista - the salvation of the Kyiv Metropolis from dragging it into schism and falling away from Orthodoxy."
2490	19	"At one time, Vladimir Putin's article ""On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians"" appeared unexpectedly and immediately made many guess - what kind of future strategic projects and decisions in foreign and domestic policy does it portend? In the light of current events, this became clear. It is worth recalling that the thesis that “Russians and Ukrainians are one people” has not been heard at the official level for more than 100 years. Before the events of 1917, in Russian and world classical science (historiography, ethnography, linguistics, etc.) it was an axiomatic statement that the Russian people consisted of three ethnic groups - Great Russians, Little Russians and Belarusians. The differences between them are ethnic, not national. It is according to scientific, and not some ideological criteria. Ideology came already in the twentieth century and overshadowed the scientific approach to this topic. The Bolsheviks created the ideology of ""three fraternal peoples"", and the Ukrainian nationalists (""Mazepins"", as they were called a hundred years ago) inspired their adherents that they were not only not ""brotherly"", but initially hostile peoples. But in both these cases there was a departure from the centuries-old consciousness of the unity of the Russian people."
2490	21	For comparison, it is also worth recalling that 100 years ago, the lands of the main European countries were inhabited by peoples who almost did not understand each other's language, but thanks to a very tough assimilation policy, now we have almost linguistically homogeneous arrays of Germans, French, British, Italians, etc. d. But 100 years ago, the languages ​​of the Bavarians and Saxons differed from each other much more than the Little Russian and Great Russian dialects of the Russian language, and for example, most of the inhabitants of Italy then did not understand the Italian literary language at all, etc. Thus, the processes in Europe and Russia in the 20th century flowed in opposite directions - unification in Europe and an artificial ethnic split in Russia, as a result of which “Ukrainians” and “Belarusians” were constructed, and only Great Russians began to be considered Russian. But by European standards, “Ukrainians” and “Belarusians” are nonsense.
2490	23	"At the moment, social chaos has begun in Ukraine, the flight of the ""elite"" and real anarchy. The “stoned” nationalists rely on a certain part of the population, which, although it is a minority in the country, is very active, aggressive and consolidated. In addition, many of them have experience in punitive operations in the Donbass. In this situation, after the re-establishment of a new state on the territory of Ukraine, a special policy of denazification of the country will be necessary, which should be carried out at the level of the state program."
2490	25	"History has a valuable precedent for denazification in post-war Germany. In its eastern part, which was under the control of the USSR, it took place in a tougher form than in the western, which later became known as the FRG. However, in both cases, this process was quite painless and was not accompanied by mass repressions. Punishment of Nazi criminals had a “pinpoint” character only on the basis of judicial investigations, and the bulk of the population was not affected in any way, although formally it could be considered that everyone, without exception, collaborated with the Nazi regime. Thanks to such a careful policy, the denazification process was carried out quickly and efficiently. An important role in it was played by the new legislation, which banned Nazi organizations and propaganda of their ideology. The same will need to be done in Ukraine, given the fact that many of the Ukronazis will try to disguise themselves under very neutral political ""signs""."
2490	27	The second aspect was to work with the mass consciousness, which had previously been subjected to massive Nazi propaganda for many years. A very similar situation is currently taking place in Ukraine, where the Bandera ideology is already de facto official, which in the 1940s was actually a variety of Nazism and Hitlerism. Thus, Ukraine will have to repeat the same path of cultural denazification that Germany once went through. That German experience will need to be used both in the field of anti-Nazi legislation and in the field of cultural policy, primarily in the field of restructuring education. In the political and administrative spheres, personnel lustration will be absolutely necessary - a ban on these types of activities for those persons who have worked in responsible positions in the administrative sphere and in politics since 2014, or who were active propagandists. Without denazification, Ukraine will always remain in a state of latent civil war and political chaos.
2490	29	After the completion of the operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, Russia will face a very difficult task of arranging this territory. Although the President of Russia V.V. Putin has previously repeatedly reminded that the aggression of Ukraine against the Republics of Donbass will lead to the liquidation of Ukrainian statehood, but this does not mean that this will happen all at once. The operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine will eliminate the Nazi puppet rage on its territory, but before the full reintegration of these territories into a single Russian state, a certain transitional period must still pass, during which Ukraine will be restored as a state friendly to Russia, and political integration will be preceded by economic integration . But for this there must be a complete change of the political and economic elite on Ukrainian territory.
2490	31	"The state ""Ukraine"" was a very specific phenomenon even against the background of other modern failed states - ""failed states"" that are not able to maintain their existence as a viable political and economic unit. This specificity lies in the fact that the current Ukrainian state, on the one hand, was initially unviable and doomed to extinction and decay, but on the other hand, it was actively used to cause maximum harm to Russia as the main geopolitical competitor of the West. The meaning of the creation of Ukraine as a state for the West initially consisted precisely in this, no one was going to include Ukraine in the ""European community"" and even more so in the ""golden billion"". Ukraine was originally for the West a kind of ""disposable tool"" according to the principle - ""used and thrown away."" And this is natural, since Ukraine, as an instrument of the West's geopolitical war against Russia, is itself a part of historical Russia. Thus, its curators from Washington expected to simultaneously achieve two goals at once: on the one hand, first create various problems for Russia with the help of this hostile state, and on the other hand, simultaneously reduce this state to insignificance so that its territory would not become in the future for Russia as a factor of its strengthening. The West understands that sooner or later Ukraine will have to be returned as the original Russian territory, but it expects to return the territory of Ukraine to Russia only as a desert, and not as a developed region. The current events cross out this vile plan, which would be the worst for both Russia and Ukraine."
2490	33	"Naturally, such a strategy cannot be voiced in any official documents, but it is easily read analytically, based on the general processes taking place in Ukraine after 1991. If the West really wanted to include Ukraine in its civilizational community (in ""Europe"", as it is called in Ukraine), then its policy towards it would be approximately the same as towards Poland - it would include real investments worth hundreds billion dollars, the inclusion of Ukraine in European structures, NATO, etc. But from the very beginning, the West was not going to do anything of the kind, and nothing depended on Ukraine itself. The country's domestic investment opportunities are meager and mostly owned by local oligarchs, and by now have been practically exhausted. Western investments mainly went to the banking sector - i.e. in reality, they were not investments, but quite the opposite - channels for pumping out the main part of profits from the country. In this situation, Ukraine was already doomed to always remain a poor third world country with a completely corrupt state system."
2490	35	"In this state, the country could exist for a long time, but its inevitable collapse was brought closer by two new factors: 1) internal - aging and extinction of the population and the flight from the country of its most able-bodied part, which led to catastrophic depopulation, even greater impoverishment and destruction of the economy; 2) two coup d'etat in the form of the so-called. ""Maidans"", which destroyed the remnants of state sovereignty and brought to power in the country a completely controlled colonial administration from the outside and established an authoritarian regime, completely destroying any possibility of a peaceful change of regime and the revival of the country."
2490	37	The only condition for the survival and revival of the people living on the territory of modern Ukraine is the re-establishment of the state. The preservation of the state that currently exists on this territory would inevitably lead to an almost complete depopulation of this territory and, as a result, to its division into zones of responsibility between neighboring states. Given the rate of depopulation, this could happen in the next 20-25 years. The only way to avoid such a development of events is not just a change of the ruling regime, but a complete re-establishment of the state in this territory. The new state may have a different name, but the essence of the matter is not in this, but in the fact that it should be based on a new real social contract between the people and the new government, based on the interests of the people living in this territory. If such a power based on a new treaty does not arise, then the state will not be re-established. And this, in turn, will mean only one thing - a further uncontested path of extinction and flight of the people, the collapse of the current anti-people state.
2490	39	"The state that emerged on the territory of present-day Ukraine in 1991 was not initially an independent political entity and tried to build its policy, focusing on its Western patrons. On the other hand, he had to maintain normal relations with Russia, from which Ukraine was and remains economically dependent for objective reasons. In this situation, Ukraine for some time even had the possibility of a slight economic growth in the early 2000s, but this process was forcibly interrupted by the first ""Maidan"" in 2004. As you know, Ukraine is the only one of all the countries of the ""former USSR"" that has not was able to restore the level of Soviet GDP in 1990. The second Maidan in 2014 made the process of devastation irreversible. This process will go to its logical conclusion in the form of the destruction of the economy and the state, landslide depopulation and social catastrophe - in the event that an alternative future is not implemented in the form of a re-establishment of statehood in this territory."
2490	41	"How can this happen? The objective basis of the existence of any state is a social contract between it and the people living on its territory. The concept of ""social contract"", as you know, appeared in the Enlightenment and denotes a clear criterion for the viability and legitimacy of any state. Only as long as the social contract between society and the state is fulfilled, the state lives and develops, and when the state violates this contract, it is doomed to destruction. This destruction may not be fast, because the state can exist for a long time without the support of its people, by ""inertia"", simply because there is nothing to replace it yet. The official part of the social contract is formulated in the Constitution of the state, but its unofficial part is actually even more important - it is the correspondence between the expectations and interests of the people, on the one hand, and the actions of the state, on the other."
2490	43	"The social contract on which the state was founded on the territory of Ukraine in 1991 was based on the promise of the state to provide the people not only with development, but also with entry into a new community, which in Ukraine is called ""Europe"". Over the past 30 years, both of these promises have not only not been fulfilled, but the process is generally going in the opposite direction. Instead of developing, Ukraine is rapidly dying out, and instead of ""Europe"", it has become one of the backward countries of the ""third world"". The authorities in Ukraine traditionally explain this fact by allegedly “unpreparedness” of the country for integration “into Europe”. Such an ""explanation"" is focused on the ignorant layman, is a deception and manipulation of the consciousness of the masses. In fact, integration ""into Europe"" does not depend on someone's readiness, but is a ""technical"" process, which is ensured by powerful investments and the country's inclusion in European structures. If this does not happen, then “readiness” itself does not play any role. As you can see, for 30 years the European Union has never intended to launch this process, and nothing depended on Ukraine itself. Thus, the basis of the agreement on which the existence of modern Ukraine is based, from the very beginning, was the lie and outright deceit of the people living here."
2490	45	"The 30th anniversary of Ukraine's ""independence"" celebrated last year allows us to draw conclusions about an entire historical era. These conclusions are quite obvious. Having become a puppet of the West, Ukraine still objectively remains a part of Russian civilization - and not only in terms of language and the remnants of culture, but also in terms of absolutely objective economic criteria, since the West considers Ukraine in its economic space only as an empty periphery of raw materials. No investments that could bring it at least to the level of Poland were originally planned to be made there - only a debt noose was planned, which works very successfully, killing the remnants of the economy."
2490	47	"All this was covered up by an incredibly false and hypocritical phrase that “Ukraine must first build its own Europe” - that is, in conditions when there is not a penny left in the country for any investments, since all the profits through their banks are sucked out of here by that the West, building on this robbery of poor countries its thieves' ""well-being"". The West understands that by killing Ukraine, in fact, it is killing a part not of its own, but of Russian civilization – they don’t do that with their own. It has long been known an interview with George Soros, in which he let slip about the goals of the West in Ukraine: according to him, Europe does not need Ukraine, it will remain Russia, but in the end Russia will receive a desert, which will become only a burden for it. That is, by destroying Ukraine, the ""masters of the world's money"" are actually destroying Russia - in parts, first splitting it into ""independent"" states, as they always strived for. Usually they argue about the degree of reliability of the mentioned interview, however, in fact, this is not even important, since an objective analysis of the ongoing processes leads to exactly the same conclusion."
2490	49	For 30 years, Ukraine has lost a third of the population and almost all of its industry, not to mention the territories - Crimea and Donbass. There are no preconditions for reversing the process of degradation and extinction, and are not foreseen. In another 30 years, the territory of Ukraine will turn almost into a desert, which, in the worst case scenario, will be divided into sectors controlled by neighboring states. The only chance for this territory not to be populated by immigrants from Asia and Africa in the future is a complete change of statehood, without which it is impossible to change this catastrophic situation.
2490	51	There is no doubt that the entire current ruling class of Ukraine is well aware of this prospect. Therefore, all of them, starting with President Zelensky himself, have foreign passports and real estate abroad. They consider Ukraine exclusively as a convenient temporary place for conducting their semi-criminal business, but in the future they are not going to live here (and their children have long been studying and living in the West). This is an occupying power in the most literal sense of the word. They will leave, leaving here the dying population, which will soon have nothing to pay pensions. Thus, without a radical change in the state in the coming decades, only slow death awaits Ukraine.
2490	53	Therefore, it is quite natural that already in 2021 the leadership of the Russian Federation announced fundamentally new theses regarding relations with Ukraine. In particular, President V.V. Putin voiced the thesis that the inhabitants of Ukraine and Russia are one people, artificially divided as a result of the catastrophic events of the twentieth century. This thesis has always been an axiom among academic scientists, but this is voiced as a political thesis for the first time since 1917 (as is known, in Tsarist Russia, the Russian nation was understood as consisting of three ethnic groups - Great Russians, Little Russians and Belarusians).
2490	55	Article by V.V. Putin about Ukraine means a fundamental turn in Russian policy: if earlier it was about the cooperation of fraternal peoples and, moreover, often even about gratuitous assistance to Ukraine (even earlier, the president also announced the figures of Russia's actual donor assistance to Ukraine in the form of low gas prices, etc.). ), but now the situation has fundamentally changed. After Ukraine, being completely under external control, unleashed a war in the Donbass against the Russian population living there and positions itself as a country at war with Russia, this policy of fraternal assistance has become impossible. Now we are only talking about the fact that the Russian Federation takes under the protection of the Russian-speaking majority of its population living in Ukraine. This has already been done in relation to the people of Donbass and is the last warning.
2490	57	In turn, a recent article by D.A. Medvedev about Ukraine has already become the logical conclusion of the public formulation of a new strategy for Russia in relation to this country. The main thesis of this article about the complete impossibility of dealing with the power that has developed in Ukraine under external control, and that Russia will wait as long as necessary until a new, negotiable and sane power emerges on this territory, means the beginning of a fundamentally new period of history. In fact, it is said that Ukraine in the form in which it currently exists is not a serious political partner for Russia, and the upcoming “reset” of power in this country is absolutely inevitable.
2490	59	Let's return to the question of how the re-establishment of statehood on the territory of Ukraine can take place as a specific political process? In the conditions of a peaceful development of events, that is, slow decay, the “trigger” of this process would be the collapse of its economy and political system, which will inevitably lead to social chaos. The collapse of the economy is already inevitable as a result of its long degradation and the catastrophic reduction in the proportion of the able-bodied population. Already in the coming years in Ukraine, the full payment of pensions would become impossible due to the aging of the population, and labor migration abroad increased even more. The loss of the “food base” of the semi-criminal business, due to which the Ukrainian so-called “political elite” exists, will also reach a critical level, which will force the majority of these people to emigrate and withdraw their capital abroad.
2490	61	Under the conditions of a general economic and political collapse, the population would begin to protest, led by former militants who fought against the Donbass, who have a large number of weapons in their hands. In this situation, there would inevitably be attempts to re-establish the state, coming from these militants professing neo-Nazi ideology. But since these people are not capable of any creative activity and do not have the support of the bulk of the population, they would not be successful, but would only continue to spin the civil war scenario. However, the events of recent days, fortunately, stopped this worst-case scenario for Ukraine and created a completely different perspective.
2490	63	"The progress of the operation in Ukraine was very revealing in many respects. First, he showed that the Russophobic “fifth column” in Russia is not at all as strong and not as large in the total share of the Russian population as it might seem, judging by social networks. Russophobes are active and aggressive in virtual reality, while real realities are cowardly and few in number. The bulk of the Russian population supports the operation and understands its necessity very well. At the same time, there were many representatives of the ""sofa troops"" who for some reason believed that a ""blitzkrieg"" should take place in a week. Such an opinion does not speak of a great mind. It is worth at least recalling two campaigns in Chechnya, which is 20 times smaller than Ukraine in terms of area and population - these campaigns lasted for several months, not even counting the subsequent fight against underground terrorists."
2490	65	"In addition, from the very beginning, the task was to minimize losses both among our own troops and among the civilian population - and this immediately means a slow advance with a long siege of cities. In addition, the Russian Federation uses few troops - exclusively contract soldiers - and therefore, from the very beginning, Ukraine has a three-fold superiority in personnel, which continues to be maintained due to mobilization in Ukraine. Although the population of Ukraine is massively hiding from mobilization and fleeing abroad, but someone is being called - in fact, ""to be slaughtered."" The strategy of the Russian army is to minimize contact battles and defeat the enemy through air supremacy and multiple superiority in artillery. This is a ""classic"" war of the XXI century. This is how the Americans fought in Iraq - however, unlike them, the Russian army is trying to save the civilian population."
2490	67	"The course of the military operation demonstrates the gratifying fact that Russia has again begun to feel sorry for the lives of its soldiers. Thank God, they don't fight with ""cannon fodder"", and this is the most important thing. The prolongation of the war due to the strategy of war in the cities, hiding behind civilians, the chosen Ukrainian army (this strategy has already been dubbed the “war of scum”) only prolongs the agony of the Ukrainian army and increases the suffering and losses of the Ukrainian population, and nothing more. This strategy of delay will not affect the outcome of the war in any way. Time is now playing for Russia and against Ukraine: Ukraine has almost no warehouses, no fuel, no aviation, no stocks left. Ukraine does not have a military industry - its remnants have already been finished off. Western deliveries are a ""drop in the ocean"", which basically will not reach the front, it will be destroyed by Russian aircraft along the way."
2490	69	Now many are asking the question about the reason for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the east of Kyiv. The troops were removed correctly and on time - why should they stand there to no avail, if they are going to take Kyiv last? Now the main task is to close the large cauldron around Slovyansk, and then it will actually be just finishing off the Ukrainian army, since all its combat-ready units will remain in the cauldron. Most likely, this large cauldron will be liquidated much faster than Mariupol, since there you can no longer hide in a huge city, and the Ukrainian troops will already be without fuel and demoralized. The correct defense strategy was chosen in the southern direction. Counterattacks on Kherson turned out to be only to the detriment of the Ukrainian army - it achieved nothing there and lost all the equipment. Ukrainians were simply driven to slaughter there, but they showed a beautiful picture for the West.
2490	71	Secondly, it quickly became clear that the most civilized version of the war, in which the Ukrainian army and its infrastructure are only destroyed, and then the government in Ukraine is changed to a more sane one, will not work. It will not work due to the fact that the Ukrainian army is fighting according to the method of terrorists - hiding in cities and hiding behind the civilian population. This delays the operation, leads to casualties among the civilian population and no longer leaves the possibility of preserving Ukraine as an integral state. It has already been officially announced by the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova: “They have already missed the main chance for the existence of Ukraine within their own borders, sovereign Ukraine, independent Ukraine.” The creation of military-civilian administrations (CAAs) in the liberated territories means that they will no longer be under the jurisdiction of Ukraine and they will have a different political future. On the territory of historical Novorossia and in the Kharkiv region, most likely, people's republics will be created according to the 2014 model, with their subsequent acceptance into the Russian Federation. The fate of the rest of the territories will depend on geopolitical alignments.
2490	73	"Thirdly, the war, of course, also showed the area where Russia is still weak and where it must urgently build up its forces. This is the realm of information warfare. Of course, some minimum information warfare is being practiced, at least in relation to the population of the Russian Federation. Western propaganda is opposed by the internal Russian information environment, which more or less protects the people of Russia from direct manipulation by enemy propaganda. But this is clearly not enough. It was necessary to urgently introduce criminal punishment for fakes about the Russian army - but this silenced only the most arrogant propagandists. In general, the information war against Russia within Russia itself continues to be waged - although not in such a frank, but no less effective form. The Russophobic ""intelligentsia"" has a huge influence on the youth of universities. Formally, they do not violate any laws, but at the same time they freely impose their pro-Western anti-Russian ideology on young people. The struggle for youth is the struggle for Russia, in the future even more important than a military operation. What to do in this situation?"
2490	75	"It would be a very important and effective measure to hold special lecture courses in universities and other places where young people gather about current events, their historical and geopolitical background. In these matters, as a rule, young people are very poorly versed - even those who consider themselves ""educated."" For these lecture courses (only a few lectures in each department), you can find good lecturers from different cities of Russia who have scientific degrees, experience in working with students and a clear patriotic worldview. Such groups of lecturers could quickly move around different cities and engage in educational work, the importance of which is now difficult to overestimate."
2490	77	"In addition, these lecturers will inevitably get into arguments with those university professors who are hostile to Russia's actions. Thus, these people will already publicly manifest themselves, and not ""underground"" engage in their aggressive anti-Russian propaganda, corrupting the youth. In general, the phenomenon of the Russophobic ""intelligentsia"", which once destroyed Russia in 1917, is once again becoming a huge national problem. Being narrow specialists in certain fields of science, these people are complete ignoramuses in everything else and do not have a normal ""natural"" mind and sense of the Motherland. Therefore, their impact on young people is truly catastrophic. Of course, Russophobic propaganda should be under the same strict legal ban as fakes about the Russian army. Unfortunately, the current Russian government is not yet fully aware of this danger."
2490	79	Although the total losses during the operation are not comparable to serious wars, nevertheless, this is a great national feat with heavy casualties. Therefore, we need to finish what we started and not repeat the mistake of 2014. The main mistake then was the hope of somehow civilized agreement with Ukraine. The Russian authorities need to understand once and for all - you can never agree on anything with Ukraine, because it will always deceive. The state, originally based on a lie, cannot be otherwise. It will be possible to negotiate not with this Ukraine, but with that state, initially friendly to Russia, which will need to be created on this territory.
2491	3	"Visa-free status and association with the EU In 2017, the demand for Schengen visas predictably fell in Ukraine due to the influence of visa-free travel. This is reported by the organization ""Europe without barriers"" with reference to its own data. Last year, only 721,000 Ukrainians applied for such a permit"
2491	5	Visa-free status and association with the EU
2491	7	In 2017, the demand for Schengen visas predictably fell in Ukraine due to the influence of the “visa-free” regime.
2491	9	"This is reported by the organization ""Europe without barriers"" with reference to its own data. Last year, only 721 thousand Ukrainians applied for such a permit, while in 2016 - more than 1.411 million. The number of visas issued, respectively, was 694 thousand and 1.36 million. visas Ukraine dropped from third place to sixth."
2491	11	True, those traveling to Europe on their own at the border discover a problem - long queues. To get past them, you have to give a bribe to the border guards (20-50 euros per car). We already wrote that the EU grant program for the construction of new checkpoints on the border with the EU countries was almost completely mastered by Ukraine, but no new checkpoints appeared.
2491	13	“After the scandal with the pit (inspectors found only a pit at the site of one of the new checkpoints, 3 million euros were allocated for construction - Ed.), Ukraine can hardly count on help from the EU to improve the border. And without modernization, there will be eternal traffic jams, especially since more people travel abroad after the visa-free regime. This is a shame for Kyiv. Brussels is tired of turning a blind eye to Ukrainian corruption and is already thinking of taking visa-free travel,” Strana.ua quoted its source in European structures as saying.
2491	15	The State Border Service reports that since the start of the regime of visa-free entry of citizens of Ukraine into the countries of the Schengen Agreement (i.e. June 11 last year), 483 thousand Ukrainians have used this right. Compared to the total passenger traffic, this is quite insignificant. So, in 2017, “vizbezniks” increased the total number of entries by only 3%.
2491	17	However, the “value” of a Ukrainian passport in the Henley & Partners rating (which evaluates passports in terms of the comfort of traveling around the world) has really increased by 19 positions at once - now Ukraine occupies as much as 80th place in the world. The reason for this growth, of course, is visa-free travel with the EU. True, Ukrainian officials rejoicing at the breakthrough forget that in 2013, in the same rating, Ukraine, without any visa-free travel, ranked 74th.
2491	19	Ukraine can get one more point of disagreement with Hungary (in addition to the language of instruction in schools with compact residence of Ukrainian Hungarians). President Petro Poroshenko initiates a law imposing sanctions against residents of Ukraine who have passports of other states. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine even on duty remembered 100 thousand Hungarian passports in Transcarpathia (the information is old, now there are more). Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto was indignant at the proposal of the leader of Ukraine. Considering that just the other day Hungary blocked the holding of the Ukraine-NATO summit at the level of foreign ministers for the third time, one can be sure that the Ukrainian authorities are blocking their own Euro-Atlantic inclinations with their own hands.
2491	21	At the same time, just two weeks ago, Poroshenko, speaking at the 11th Kiev Security Forum, once again touched on the topic of the NATO Membership Action Plan:
2491	23	“I emphasize that there will be no better case. Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia belong to the Western alliance and should be part of it. This is our agenda. Until the next high-level meetings with NATO and the EU. As far as NATO is concerned, we will push for a Enhanced Opportunities Program for Ukraine and a Membership Action Plan.”
2491	25	Those. it seems that a person wants to shove Ukraine into NATO, but then he remembers: “The Hungarians issued 100,000 passports in Transcarpathia! Moreover, they want to keep Hungarian as the language of instruction.” And plans are flying down the drain: what kind of MAP is there if Ukraine has been corny unable to hold a formal summit with NATO since October last year?
2491	27	Work migration
2491	29	The quantitative migration of Ukrainians to Poland is gradually developing into a qualitative one.
2491	31	“Among individuals, there is a growing interest in buying land in Poland by citizens of Ukraine. In 2017, they received 134 permits, which is almost 50% of all permits for the purchase of land real estate, which are issued to individuals,” the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs said in a report.
2491	33	It should be noted that this is already a trend - in 2016, Ukrainians received 47% of such permits.
2491	35	Meanwhile, the Polish economy does not even think about getting fed up with Ukrainians. According to the forecast of the Union of Entrepreneurs and Employers of Poland, in order to support economic growth, they need to attract 5 million migrants, and, according to Polish experts, the total number of invitations issued for Ukrainians in 2018 will be 3 million (1.7 in 2017, according to information from the chairman of the Polish -Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce of Jacek Pehota). Overcoming the threshold of 2 million Ukrainians at a recent press conference in Kyiv was confirmed by the Polish Ambassador to Ukraine Jan Pieklo.
2491	37	Approximately 100,000 more Ukrainian migrants are expected this year in Slovakia - the local Ministry of Labor has turned to its Ukrainian colleagues with a request for assistance.
2491	39	Due to the high rates of labor migration in Ukraine, it has become an extreme problem to calculate the real employment of the population. Let's say that only 360 thousand unemployed people are registered with the Employment Service, the ILO gives 1.8 million, and the State Statistics Service - 1.7 million. However, how to understand which of them are really unemployed, and who only waits 6 months to have the right to return again to work in Poland?
2491	41	Sectoral imbalances also hinder the assessment. For example, there is a shortage of personnel in blue-collar professions: enterprises are forced to “scoop out” vocational school graduates and finish their education already at work, because there are no other ways to recruit staff.
2491	43	However, there is an indirect argument in favor of the fact that unemployment in Ukraine is indeed declining. The National Bank of Poland, which studied the motivation among Ukrainian guest workers, cites interesting statistics. So, until 2013, more than 36% of respondents named the lack of work as the reason for leaving to work in Poland, and almost 50% - too low wages. Now the ratio has changed: almost 60% of respondents are dissatisfied with the salary, while only 20% of migrants complain about the lack of work. And the number of migrants who cited the political situation as a reason has grown exponentially: before there were only 3.5% of them, now it is 12.5%.
2491	45	“Ukraine is simply becoming part of the European labor market, and other countries have already gone through a similar process,” Poroshenko himself said at an expanded government meeting, thereby making it clear how the authorities relate to this process.
2491	47	But experts do not agree with this assessment.
2491	49	“These phrases confirm that our officials did not teach well or did not teach the science of the development of labor resources. The new members of the EU faced similar problems. But it's one thing when on your western borders there is a country with a high-quality labor market, and on your eastern borders with a low level of wages. Then the problem of compensation of labor resources is solved at the expense of the eastern market. And Ukraine has become a black hole of labor resources: people migrate to the west, north, south and east. Who will compensate us for the outflow of labor?” — financial expert Oleksiy Kushch explains Poroshenko’s mistake in a commentary for Newsone.ua.
2491	51	The outflow of people is already being discussed at the level of parliament
2491	53	“The situation today is quite strange - in the western regions of Ukraine, where investors have entered, in particular, Japanese investors, and from Germany and other countries of the European community. There is a problem with the recruitment of people to work. That is, Western Ukraine, due to the fact that we already have a visa-free regime, left to work as labor migrants in the European Union, ”said Irina Lutsenko, the presidential representative in parliament, during a speech in the Verkhovna Rada.
2491	55	Well, the French ambassador to Ukraine warned Ukrainian officials about this exactly a year ago.
2491	57	Meanwhile, Poland is beginning to think about attracting not only unskilled labor, but also Ukrainian doctors. Rzeczpospolita writes about the plans of the Polish Ministry of Health to simplify employment for non-EU health workers. In particular, it is planned to cancel the nostrification of diplomas for doctors.
2491	59	The government of Ukraine does not leave hopes to lay hands on the earnings of migrants. Minister of Social Policy Andriy Reva proposes to accrue seniority to such Ukrainians, as well as to make it possible for their family members in Ukraine to receive housing subsidies for utility bills. However, all this is offered to buy.
2491	61	“... We are ready to give a subsidy to families where people work abroad, provided that they voluntarily insure themselves and pay a contribution for at least three months ... For three months, the minimum contribution is UAH 2,500, and for this we give them a subsidy and insurance experience which will give people the right to a pension,” he said on the air of the 112 Ukraine TV channel.
2491	63	Economy and export
2491	65	In January-February, Ukraine exported agricultural and food products to the EU in the amount of $2.8 billion (+$102 million compared to the same period last year), Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine for European Integration said at a press conference Olga Trofimtseva. This is approximately 36.5% of Ukrainian agricultural exports for the specified period. In general, 45.1% of Ukrainian exports in these months were sent to the EU.
2491	67	Such active exports led to the fact that, as of April 17, Ukrainian producers had exhausted quotas for six items: honey, malt and wheat gluten, processed tomatoes, grape and apple juices, wheat, and corn. Moreover, in the case of honey, processed tomatoes, wheat and corn, both the main quotas (fixed in the agreement on the creation of an FTA with the EU) and additional ones (provided to Ukraine last year for a period of three years) have been exhausted. Ukraine also managed to use the second quarterly quota for the export of poultry meat and a semi-annual quota for butter.
2491	69	"""... As of the same date in 2017, the volumes of wheat have not yet been exhausted, and the quota for malt and wheat gluten in general for the past year remained unused,"" the analyst of foreign trade in agri-food products of the association Ukrainian Club of Agrarian business Daria Gritsenko."
2491	71	Truly explosive growth in stone fruit exports. Thus, the export of plums to the EU in 2016 brought Ukraine 2.4 thousand dollars, and already in 2017 - 6.2 million dollars (mostly sold to Poland - 5.4 million). Inspired by this success, farmers are going to increase exports in other areas this year as well.
2491	73	“There will be attempts to enter the EU market (Poland, the Baltic states) with strawberries in May and autumn 2018. An increase in the export of sweet cherries to the EU and Asia, as well as melons - in new directions is expected. For example, Kherson watermelons can go to the UK, the first such attempts were made in 2017,” Delo.ua quotes fruit and vegetable market analyst Tatyana Hetman.
2491	75	In general, in the first quarter of 2018, Ukraine exported fruits, berries and nuts for $57 million (+68% YoY). True, this result was mainly provided by the export of walnuts ($42 million).
2491	77	"Europe does not leave attempts to force Ukraine to lift the moratorium on the export of round timber (in force since 2016). The Government of Ukraine and the European Commission have finalized the list of ""neutral"" arbitrators, one of them will head the arbitration. In total there will be three groups of arbitrators (neutral, from Ukraine and from the EU). It is they who will decide whether Ukraine had the right to introduce such a moratorium in accordance with the FTA agreement."
2491	79	The problem is that there is still no group of arbitrators from Ukraine. Or rather, there is, but not in full force: Poroshenko approved four candidates, the last candidate has been under consideration by the Presidential Administration for eight months. And 80% readiness in such matters does not happen, only 100%.
2491	81	The EU is convinced that the Ukrainian side is deliberately delaying the process of forming its group of arbitrators. At the end of February, the European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmström, even sent an extremely harsh ultimatum to Kyiv, in which she warned that if Ukraine did not provide its arbitrators, those arbitrators who could be approved would begin consideration.
2491	83	“Several representatives of the European Union at once, right up to the general director responsible for relations with neighbors, assured the European Truth: Brussels has never had to start arbitration with partners with whom the EU has a free trade agreement. It was always possible to negotiate peacefully ... but Ukraine turned out to be special, ”says Serhiy Sidorenko and Yuriy Panchenko, journalists for the publication.
2491	85	By the way, this is not the only problem in trade with the EU. Gennadiy Ryabtsev, deputy director of the Psyche science and technology center, warns that the EU could impose sanctions on Ukraine if the government does decide to introduce fuel import quotas.
2491	87	Poland this year may come out on top among Ukraine's trading partners, if not in terms of trade, then in terms of exports, President of the Ukrainian Analytical Center Oleksandr Okhrimenko predicts in his article for 112.ua. According to the results of the first quarter, Ukrainian manufacturers exported products worth $853 million to Russia and $816 million to Poland. The gap is really very small.
2491	89	However, despite all the successes in increasing exports to Europe, in the top five countries where Ukraine sells most of its goods, there are only two countries from the EU zone: Poland and Italy (2nd and 3rd place).
2491	91	Grants, programs, targeted funding
2491	93	As previously reported, the issue of lifting the moratorium on the export of round timber will not be put forward as a condition for providing Ukraine with another package of macro-financial assistance (a loan of 1 billion euros) from the EU. However, this does not mean that it will be provided completely without conditions. The European Parliament is discussing a proposal to allocate funds in exchange for the obligation to create a system for checking the property declarations of officials and data on the beneficiaries of companies. Moreover, as follows from the words of European officials (“... in the light of the incomplete implementation of the program related to the third package by Ukraine, it is advisable to include specific conditions for each of the two tranches of this assistance”), the funds will be allocated in small doses and only under the progress report.
2491	95	"The EU has prepared another assistance program for Ukraine - ""Reforms for Investment"", under which Ukraine will be able to receive up to 50 million euros. Moreover, as Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for European Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, promises, its economic effect can be ten times higher than the actual grant part and will allow Ukraine to attract up to 0.5 billion euros of investments. According to the already known tradition, first you will need to do something. For these 50 million euros, Europe will require, in particular:"
2491	97	- independent regulation in the energy sector, i.e. all powers on tariffs, their validity and control will be transferred to the National Commission for Regulation of Energy and Utilities (NEURC);
2491	99	- also in the EU they want to cancel the e-declaration for anti-corruption officials.
2493	3	"MOSCOW, July 8 - RIA Novosti. The former Supreme Commander of the Allied NATO Forces in Europe, General Philip Breedlove, called the Crimean Bridge a ""legitimate target"" for Ukrainian troops, the Russian authorities have repeatedly harshly criticized such statements, including comparing them with the words of terrorists and noting that all attempts to cause damage will fail and will be severely suppressed."
2493	4	According to the general, Ukraine could use recently delivered Harpoon missiles to strike the bridge.
2493	6	"There are many Western leaders and former leaders, like me, who are now talking about what will happen if Russia starts sinking Ukrainian grain ships, or if the Russian naval blockade continues ... There are discussions about how the West can react if it will happen. Several people I spoke to said that the fall ""(destruction) of the Kerch Bridge would be a huge blow to Russia. The Kerch Bridge is a legitimate target,"" Breedlove told the British Times newspaper."
2493	8	Earlier, Major General of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Dmitry Marchenko told the Ukrainian media that the Crimean bridge would become the number one goal if the Ukrainian troops were supplied with appropriate weapons from the United States and Europe. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation then informed that it would give a legal assessment of his statements. Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Irina Yarovaya compared Marchenko's words with the typical behavior of terrorists. Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov noted that the security of Crimea is guaranteed by preventive measures taken by the Russian military. He also stated that the threats against the Crimean bridge are known to the Kremlin, they are taken into account. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking on the topic of threats against the Crimean bridge, pointed out that all these statements are taken into account, such plans will fail.
2493	10	State Duma deputy from the Crimean region Mikhail Sheremet called Kyiv's threat to strike the Crimean bridge a suicide and warned that in the event of even an attempted provocation, decision-making centers would be immediately destroyed. The head of the Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, pointed out that attempts to damage the Crimean bridge would be severely suppressed, the security of the structure and other strategic facilities was ensured at the highest level. According to him, the land part of Crimea is covered by air defense forces as much as possible, nothing threatens the peninsula.
2493	11	"Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. President Vladimir Putin called its goal ""the protection of people who have been subjected to genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years."" According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, as of March 25, the Armed Forces completed the main tasks of the first stage - they significantly reduced the combat potential of Ukraine. The main goal in the Russian military department was called the liberation of Donbass. In particular, Volnovakha, a strategically important regional center south of Donetsk, Mariupol, the largest city on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov, and Svyatogorsk, which houses a large Orthodox monastery with the status of a lavra, have been liberated in the DPR. On July 3, with the capture of Lisichansk and the surrounding settlements, the entire territory of the LPR was liberated."
2497	1	Ukraine has sold its sovereignty. How the country will pay the West - Political scientist Dontsov: The West can take land from Ukraine to pay off part of the debts
2497	3	Ukraine has borrowed money from various countries, from Japan to the United States. We are talking about huge sums. At the same time, even in Europe they have already started talking about how the West will return its money. Experts are sure that no one in Ukraine is thinking about this now. In fact, you will have to pay. And most likely, famous agricultural lands and enterprises will be used. This will lead to the plundering of the country and the final loss of sovereignty.
2497	5	Ukraine and its debts to the West
2497	7	"MEP from France Thierry Mariani expressed doubt that Ukraine can pay off debts on loans. This was written by RT with reference to the document of the politician's appeal to the European Commission. According to the MEP, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, proposed to allocate grants to Ukraine instead of loans. The IMF noted that it is necessary to clarify ""the financial needs of Kyiv and adjust the ways to meet them."""
2497	9	“Can the European Commission guarantee that the amount of assistance that will be provided to Ukraine will be calculated based on the real ability of the country to pay such amounts?” Mariani asked.
2497	11	In early July, the European Commission proposed to allocate a billion euros to Ukraine from a new package of macro-financial support, which was announced in May. At the same time, the country received $500 million from Japan with a maturity of 30 years, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine reported. The interest rate on the loan is 1% per annum.
2497	13	Canada agreed to provide Ukraine with a loan of about $398 million. The World Bank (WB) has already announced the preparation of a $1.5 billion assistance package for Ukraine to support the provision of public services to the population. Before that, he already reported that he had collected $ 723 million. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously announced a loan guarantee for an additional $500 million from the World Bank.
2497	15	The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the allocation of emergency financial assistance to Ukraine in the amount of $1.4 billion. Back in February, US President Joe Biden instructed Ukraine to allocate 600 million in financial assistance, including 350 million for defense.
2497	17	After that, the United States more than once provided loans to Ukraine, including lend-lease: $40 billion from the United States. And these endless assistance programs from European countries, from NATO. Political scientist Nikita Dontsov is sure that this is how Ukraine is being driven into debt.
2497	19	“We understand that all this is not happening free of charge. They issue loans at interest. And how Ukraine will pay for them with a ruined economy is not very clear. But they still have to pay, ”the political scientist emphasized.
2497	21	Ukraine may lose the most profitable territories
2497	23	Dontsov recalled that Russia, for example, paid off Lend-Lease payments, which were much smaller and were provided to the United States during World War II, only in 2006. Accordingly, Ukraine will now take a lot of weapons systems, equipment, loans and will pay for them for at least 100 years, and maybe more, the political scientist believes.
2497	25	"True, now in Ukraine no one thinks at all about how and with what the country will pay off its debts to the West. This was told to 360 by a political scientist, economist, ex-chairman of the public movement ""Battle for Donbass"" Alexei Zhivov."
2497	27	Globally, no one thinks about who, how and at whose expense will then pay these colossal debts. <...> How Ukraine plans to settle accounts is a big mystery, especially considering that, let's say, the intensity of the conflict with Russia will very likely lead Ukraine to truncate territories
2497	29	Alexey Zhivov.
2497	31	It is in the south-eastern regions, which Ukraine can just lose, that 60% of the economy and 60% of the country's natural resources are concentrated, Zhivov is sure. According to him, the state that will remain, if it remains after the end of the special military operation, will be very modest - both in size and in economic opportunities. According to the scale of the territory, the political scientist believes, Ukraine will become no larger than Belarus.
2497	33	“It will be a country half the size and three times the size of the economy. How are they planning to pay? A mystery,” Zhivov stressed.
2497	35	The West can pay off debts at the expense of Russian assets
2497	37	In the event of a fiasco, he believes, the US and Europe will collect debts at the expense of frozen Russian assets. For this they were frozen, the political scientist noted. He stressed that anything can be expected from the West, as it has long gone beyond the legal norms.
2497	39	“It’s just that at some point they will come up with a legislative framework for themselves, justifying it with the next Russophobic cries. And under this guise, all debts from Russia will be written off. I hear that they are preparing for this, but it will be extremely fraught for them. Western institutions around the world will completely lose their legitimacy: the institution of the dollar, and the institution of the court, and the institution of property,” Zhivov explained.
2497	41	Ukraine can pay the West with land
2497	43	Ukraine is famous for its unique fund of agricultural land, reminded Dontsov. And, in his opinion, the West could get debts precisely through the sale of large land plots.
2497	45	“Until recently, almost all land in Ukraine was state-owned. Until now, large areas are in state ownership. For many centuries, all foreigners hunted for this black soil. One of the options is to exchange this invaluable land resource for the cancellation of part of the debts, ”the political scientist noted.
2497	47	It is also possible to sell some large enterprises, many of which have been nationalized. The state has organizations in almost all areas of Ukraine - from the production of pet food and ending with enterprises that breed horses. All of these assets can also be sold to pay off debt.
2497	49	“The Ukrainian state may be left without any assets at all. Also, he will probably have to make some political concessions. <...> I do not think that the land and enterprises will pay off all the debts, but some part - probably. These loans, which Ukraine has collected, will simply lead to the plundering of the country, all of its unique reserves. <...> All this can go into foreign ownership, ”concluded Dontsov.
2497	51	All loans, the political scientist stressed, are primarily a political tool for the West, because by falling into such dependence, Ukraine has actually sold its sovereignty.
2499	1	Georgia, Ukraine... Who's next?
2499	3	Georgia, Ukraine: where to expect the West's next strike against Russia?
2499	4	Realizing the complexity and ambiguity of the problem, let's try to draw an analogy between Georgia and Ukraine, and the events that happened before and are happening now. And assess where the next blow from the West should be expected? ...
2499	7	Georgia, Ukraine... Who's next? Post-Soviet Space: Where Should We Expect the West's Next Strike?
2499	9	That is why analogies are a thankless thing due to the presence of a large number of details, the fate of which is to be ruthlessly discarded in order to identify general trends and, on the basis of the received basis, obtain a basic scenario. What details to discard, what to leave is the choice (and risk) of the author, as well as readers who agree or disagree with the indicated choice.
2499	11	So, what are the differences and similarities between the Georgian and Ukrainian events? And why was their negative vector towards Russia inevitable, despite Russia's colossal efforts to prevent such a scenario?
2499	13	Let's start with the fact that in both Georgia and Ukraine, anti-Soviet sentiments were initially strong, which naturally grew into anti-Russian ones.
2499	15	"By and large, after the collapse of the USSR, a fratricidal civil war was simply bound to break out throughout the territory of the former Union. However, one of the few wise decisions of the then criminal divorce was Russia's application for the title of successor to the USSR, in particular, in relation to external debts. It was this step, which greatly facilitated the entry into statehood for the newly formed countries, that did not rule out, but at least delayed the emergence of a number of centers of instability and claims tied to the economy and finance. At least, the ""all-Union"" civil war of all with all did not happen."
2499	17	"At the same time, like everyone else, Georgia and Ukraine happily got rid of the pie of possible debts, but failed to take advantage of the opportunities they received. However, almost no one could take full advantage, although to a slightly different extent. Almost everywhere a dead end was drawn and the search for an external enemy began, quickly and carefully fueled by the eternal Western Russophobia. Some went fast, some slowed down. Georgia and Ukraine had no particular doubts, immediately finding themselves in the forefront, quickly standing out as the ""leaders"" of the discordant choir."
2499	19	"Here it is worth remembering that even in the late Soviet period there were cases when a train with the direction ""Georgia - the Soviet Union"" left Tbilisi, and the signs changed when crossing the border of the republic. In Ukraine, it was different, especially in the western regions, where in Soviet times nationalism smoldered, which had other forms, rather underground, immediately, after gaining independence, resulted in semi-legal camps, where young people instantly began to intensively prepare for future Maidans."
2499	21	One way or another, but both former Soviet republics came to extremely Russophobic regimes, albeit on different roads: Georgia - through a destructive civil war that destroyed all economic potential, Ukraine - more consistently, but with the same result, significantly losing the enormous opportunities inherited in inheritance from the Ukrainian SSR.
2499	23	"As a result, in Georgia there was a ""revolution of roses"" and the coming to power of the extreme Russophobe Saakashvili, in Ukraine there was a Maidan and no less Russophobe Yushchenko, who came to power by a strange vote. Tellingly, both events occurred almost simultaneously in 2004."
2499	25	"So, we have revealed the following: in Georgia and Ukraine, two ""color revolutions"" occurred simultaneously, although they came to them by different roads. Georgia went through a civil war and was completely ruined. Ukraine, having avoided shocks, has not completely lost its potential, remaining a large economy, especially against the backdrop of the post-Soviet space."
2499	27	Why Georgia?
2499	28	And now let's emphasize once again: both of these events took place with significant support from the West, but this similarity should have been followed by a choice: which of the two to bet on? Or maybe two at once?
2499	30	I believe that if the West faced such a choice today, the second option would be chosen without a doubt. However, in 2004, it still seemed that Russia had not departed too far from the role assigned to it by the globalists. Well, she fooled around with Yukos, well, she canceled the predatory PSA schemes (production sharing agreements) and tolling.
2499	32	"There was no ""Munich speech"" yet, the army was breathing its last after the ""fire to kill"" in the 90s, the oligarchs were just on the verge of realizing that at least taxes had to be paid. So, it might well seem that a Georgian kick in an American boot is enough, and the old bear will either die or come to its senses irreversibly. In addition, for some Georgians, the cost of ""boots"" is an order of magnitude less and, in view of the zero economy, there is no need to rebuild anything, unlike Ukraine, which is closely integrated with Russia by numerous production chains."
2499	34	In general, by the method of exclusion, and also in view of the insignificance of Yushchenko as a person, the unconditional choice fell on the unbalanced, but impulsive Saakashvili. Further, everything is known to everyone to the commas, which, just because of their wide popularity, we will omit and recall only a few important details:
2499	36	- during the five-day war, the Russian Armed Forces captured war trophies in the amount of only 150 armored vehicles. In addition, a large number of American and European-made weapons, as well as military vehicles, including Hummers, were seized, which the Pentagon demanded to immediately return to the United States. Russia, of course, did not return anything to anyone, and the Hammers are now in the Museum of the Ministry of Defense in Kubinka;
2499	37	- in the course of a fleeting war, all of Georgia fell into the cauldron, and as a result, it lost significant territories: Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which immediately turned into strongholds of the Russian armed forces in Transcaucasia;
2499	39	- during the war, there was a fleeting naval episode, when Georgian military boats, ignoring Russian requests, were destroyed without hesitation by naval missile salvos;
2499	41	- despite the promised support, neither Europe nor the United States did anything but outrage to save their protégés from military defeat.
2499	43	Thus, the five-day war ended for Georgia in a complete fiasco with the loss of territories, military property and reputation.
2499	45	Let's move on to Ukraine
2499	47	Yushchenko's insignificance quickly became apparent not only to external players, but to the very people of Ukraine. Therefore, gradually, regardless of anything, the second Maidan began to be prepared, which happened in 2013. An even greater Russophobe Poroshenko came to power, immediately sent by the curators strictly to the east.
2499	49	There was only one problem: there was no time to train and train the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so there was no open war with Russia, but there was a kind of civil war in the form of a protracted military confrontation with the rebellious republics of Donbass, unconditionally supported by Russia both humanitarianly and military equipment, equipment and ammunition .
2499	51	Based on the results of a 4-year confrontation in a war that Russia did not attend:
2499	53	- Ukrainian military aviation was almost completely destroyed, a huge amount of armored vehicles and other weapons, including foreign ones, were captured, ammunition depots on the territory of Ukraine itself are destroyed with a regular sequence. Losses in personnel, permanently falling into the boilers, far exceed the official UN figures and are only increasing;
2499	55	- in the course of hostilities, a part of the Donbass was actually lost, as well as Crimea, where Russia has taken strict preventive measures to prevent violence and is currently equipping a strategically important territory in accordance with its plans, including (and above all) the military;
2499	57	- at present, the West provides Ukraine with fairly broad support, both material and financial, and military, which, however, will quickly dry up in the event of an open armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine;
2499	59	"- and the last detail: before our eyes, Ukrainian combat boats attempted a ""heroic"" breakthrough of Russian territorial waters, very similar to what Georgian boats tried to do on August 10, 2008, which, however, rushed to their port of Poti, already captured by the Russian army . The result of the Ukrainian provocation is known: the boats were captured along with the personnel. They were captured relatively gently, although with shooting, and without fatal consequences, which the FSB Coast Guard could do at once."
2499	61	"As a result, the boats of the Ukrainian Navy, which, according to some funny estimates, make up about a third of the entire military fleet, will most likely be placed in some kind of museum (as well as the ever-memorable ""Georgian"" Hummers) due to their complete initial unsuitability for naval battles. During the capture, something like a ram was used, suspiciously reminiscent of a 30-year-old naval bulk (although not in such a ratio of weight categories), used by Soviet sailors of the Black Sea Fleet to train American warships."
2499	63	"Now you can talk as much as you like about the supposed ""peaceful"" passage of combat boats into the Sea of ​​​​Azov, calculate territorial waters and prove who went where or did not go. However, by definition, it is impossible to allow armed boats into the Kerch Strait without inspection by the FSB coastal service. Actually, this is precisely why it exists, despite the ukrophantasmagoria and phantom pains regarding the ownership of the Crimea."
2499	65	Thus, the five-day war in August 2008 and the failed war with Ukraine brought enormous territorial and material losses to both Western protégés.
2499	67	Outcome
2499	69	Georgia and Ukraine in their condition are unconditional projects of the West directed against Russia in order to restrain the growth of its potential as a competitor. There is no doubt that in the event of an open military conflict with Ukraine, the war will end with the same lightning boiler of the entire territory and only with the timing adjusted for the large difference in the size of the countries (Georgia and Ukraine).
2499	71	"With all the significant similarities in the development of conflicts, growing Russophobia, the timing of ""color revolutions"" with different starting positions, one should take into account the fundamental difference in the attitude of Russians (Russians) towards Georgians and Ukrainians: if there was a real war with Ukraine, the Russian army would fire to kill only in in the most extreme case, trying to make the most of all other available means and instruments, the main of which is the threat of overwhelming military power."
2499	73	With all the love of Russians for the wonderful Georgian people, based on cultural, historical and religious traditions, the ethnic component cannot be discounted in any way. For Ukrainians are the same Russians, only in some places they are badly corrupted by the West.
2499	75	"In principle, the latter can be quickly remedied by simply turning the handle labeled ""propaganda"" by 180°. Especially quickly if the Kyiv regime, after all, decides on a real large-scale provocation. Moreover, for some people, despite the Georgian (invaluable) experience, there is no other option for maintaining power after March 2019 in nature. This means that the fiasco with the introduction of martial law for 30 days instead of 60 is only an intermediate result, and we should expect an attempt to break through anywhere in the fragile, bad peace, which, of course, is better than a good war."
2499	77	The dog barks - the caravan moves on
2499	79	1. Today, Georgia, despite the continuation of the pro-Western course and the declaration of territorial claims to the lost territories, is a fairly peaceful state with a colorless political life - few people will immediately name even the name of the president, both the previous one and the one who just won the elections (besides the fact that this is woman), not to mention second-tier politicians.
2499	81	Russia is quite satisfied with this, since in the future, with the final fading of the West's interest in the Transcaucasus (unless, of course, Armenia throws firewood on the fire), the usual neutrality and normal relations of the two peoples, doomed to be close neighbors, are possible. Perhaps a similar fate awaits Ukraine. In any case, such an outcome, at least, would be acceptable, since it does not imply further bloodshed in the Donbass, just as it is not flowing now in South Ossetia.
2499	83	"However, bearing in mind the mental and ethnic differences known to the West, I think that they are not very interested in Ukrainian neutrality, because for them this is tantamount to a real defeat. However, no other actions to support Ukraine, other than frowns and loud speeches about ""close attention"", should not be expected anymore."
2499	85	"From which it follows that the result of the naval battle in the Black Sea is only the beginning of a long journey towards the return home of the ""severely spoiled"" Russians. Even if not all, but only along the left bank of the river, to the middle of which, as you know, not every bird will fly."
2499	87	2. Hard times lie ahead for Russia, both in terms of the inevitable pacification of Ukraine, and in preparing for new, just as inevitable, points of instability, and as potentially rich in provocations as the previous ones. It is not known how and when it will end, in any case, accusations of incessant aggression are unambiguous. As well as the inevitable accusation of unleashing a full-scale war, if such a reality happened. I do not really want to call the war a world war yet, although according to many authoritative estimates, all signs of such a development of the situation are already evident.
2499	89	In the meantime, the bottom line, Russia:
2499	91	- sharply increases the icebreaking fleet for escorting merchant ships along the Northern Sea Route, capable of taking on a significant part of the trade turnover of the western and eastern hemispheres. And in the course of 2019, it introduces a notification character for any foreign warships that intend to take a walk along near our northern borders. In principle, exactly the same notification as for the passage of the Kerch Strait. With all the ensuing consequences;
2499	93	- Together with Iran and India, it is intensively discussing the construction of the North-South Trans-Iranian Water Trade Corridor (from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean), which could become another cheap alternative to the Suez Canal. Which option the corridor will follow depends largely on the prospects for stability in the Middle East, including (and above all) on the final fate of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
2499	95	This means that we should prepare for a new round of tough sanctions counteraction by those who are not ready to put up with normal competition where they are used to speaking only in the language of ultimatums. Transnistria may well turn out to be such a place, where:
2499	97	- the republic is squeezed from two sides by unfriendly regimes, one of which has introduced martial law in the neighboring Vinnitsa region;
2499	99	– more than a hundred thousand citizens have Russian passports;
2499	101	- the Russian contingent deprived by the UN General Assembly quite recently (in September 2018) of the status of an international peacekeeping mission.
2499	103	And most importantly, the Russian contingent has no rear, which means: in the event of a large-scale provocation, Russia will immediately come to the aid of its soldiers and citizens, for which it will be forced to send troops to Ukraine with all the ensuing international consequences. Q.E.D.
2499	105	The dog barks - the caravan moves on.
