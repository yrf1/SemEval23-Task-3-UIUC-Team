251	1	Nord Stream 2 is the biggest problem of German politics
251	3	"The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and the resulting energy dependence on Russia are the biggest problem of German foreign policy, writes the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, stressing that Germany must free itself from ""destructive dependence"" on Russian gas."
251	5	Such a relationship already existed during the Cold War, but back then it was argued that supplier and customer needed each other and should separate business from politics in their own interests, the paper adds.
251	7	"Germany needs Russian gas, and Russia needs German money, but ""Russian president (Vladimir Putin) thinks strategically"" and put the issue of income into the background - notes ""SZ""."
251	9	"""Russia has long pursued a strategy of dividing the European Union, isolating individual states, and thus dismantling Europe's strongest weapon: economic unity,"" the paper assesses, noting that such an approach can protect it from sanctions and also ""serves the overriding purpose of holding the EU and its democratic ideals at a distance."
251	11	"SZ points out that ""the most important target of this destabilization policy is Germany, because this country has the greatest influence in Europe, and society and politics are divided in the perception of Russia."""
251	13	"""Of course, there is no technical problem behind this, but a political intention that President Vladimir Putin has often and directly emphasized: if the NS2 gas pipeline is finally launched, the gas shortage will end,"" writes ""SZ"", adding that such blackmail requires a difficult decision: surrender or resist."
251	15	Approval of the NS2 gas pipeline will be the most important foreign policy decision that the new federal government will inherit from the previous one, which will force the new ruling coalition to take a stand on this issue, the newspaper notes.
251	17	"As he estimates, because the problematic issue of Nord Stream 2 has been unresolved for a long time, ""earlier arguments for its construction are weakening"" - for example, that if Russia turns off the gas tap, Ukraine and Central European countries will be able to supply the so-called reverse from Germany. However, the daily points out that ""if gas is really scarce and German gas suppliers start arguing about every cubic meter, the conflict will move to Western Europe."""
251	19	"There are many problems, and ""the buyer is trapped in a web of dependence and his own vulnerability to blackmail."" In this situation, there is only one way out - Germany must free itself from dependence on Russia by finding other sources of supply, alternative energy sources, firmness in interpreting the supply contract and finally a political decision to close the gas pipeline."
251	21	Not only is Ukraine becoming a potential target for Russia's gas policy, Germany is also falling into pernicious dependence. The problem is by no means diminishing,” sums up the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.

2510	1	War in Ukraine: Latest Information.
2510	3	The war in Ukraine live: below, in the points, we present a collection of the most important information from the war front in Ukraine and the Polish and global economy.
2510	5	Currently, Russian activities outside the Donbas do not have a character that would testify to the Kremlin's desire to seize more territories, according to experts from the Center for Eastern Studies. Russian units were limited to the so-called improving the tactical situation and expanding defensive positions.
2510	7	However, information from American intelligence, cited by the OSW, may indicate that Russia is not abandoning its plans for further expansion in the directions of Zaporozhye, Kryvyi Rih and Mykolaiv.
2510	9	Finland and Sweden formally applied for NATO membership on Wednesday, May 18. The proposal is considered one of the most significant changes to international security in decades.
2510	11	The evacuation of soldiers from the Azovstal steelworks, who surrendered after many weeks of tough resistance to the Russian siege, is underway. This ends one of the hardest and toughest battles of the war. President Zelensky said in an interview with French President Emmanuel Macron that the evacuation is being carried out under the supervision of the Ukrainian authorities in the form of an exchange of prisoners of war, but they did not provide details about the operation. Currently, it is not known how many people are still in the steelworks and how many are already in Russia. Their further fate is also in doubt, as it is not known whether Russia will decide to exchange prisoners of war in accordance with the agreement.
2510	13	The Russian siege of Mariupol lasted more than ten weeks. Ukrainian resistance significantly delayed Russia's ability to gain full control of the city and caused heavy losses to Russian forces.
25100	3	Donald Tusk says he will conduct a pilot project on shortening the working week. His political opponents accuse him of stealing other people's ideas, hypocrisy and making empty promises. But does a four-day workweek make sense? According to some economists, change is inevitable. But now is not the right time for it.
25100	5	"A few days ago, Donald Tusk announced that his election proposal would be to shorten the working time of Poles. ""In Poland, we should, and this will be my proposal, if we win the elections - sorry: when we win the elections - to start the shortened working week program as soon as possible,"" said the New Generation of Civic Platform Meet Up in Szczecin during a meeting with young people."
25100	7	"The program could consist in shortening the working day to, for example, 7 hours or the working week to four days. There is no reduction in salary. Implementation of the reform across the country would depend on the positive effects of the previously conducted pilot. Until the elections, Tusk is to present its exact project. Other politicians quickly picked up on the topic. First, Adrian Zandberg from the Together Party pointed out that his party had presented a similar postulate several years ago. In 2018, the party collected signatures for a civic bill on working time shorter by 7 hours, without a reduction in pay. ""7 hours is more time for the family and for the development of interests"" - promoted the project of the Party Together. “I suggest working 7 hours a week! Or not - in a month,"" Borys Budka from PO mocked at the time, whose social media entry politicians from the Together Party did not fail to recall now. Zandberg ironically states that he does not doubt the spiritual transformation of PO politicians, but recommends voting for the party that is the actual author of the proposal. In turn, Robert Biedroń from Nowa Lewica indicated that his party would submit a draft law on a four-day working week and see what would happen. ""We will check Donald Tusk and all PO deputies, as well as other groups, whether they will support us during the vote,"" said Biedroń in one of the TV programs. Hanna Gill-Piątek from Poland 2050 stated that she had nothing against the experiment. On the other hand, Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Poland 2050, torpedoed the idea: ""It's really hard to understand the purpose of discussing the four-day working week at a time when people are doing everything to be able to earn more, so that finally there is no shortage,"" he wrote on Twitter."
25100	9	PiS: Tusk promises 4 days of work? Get ready for 6 days
25100	11	"A strong opponent of the proposal is Artur Dziambor from the Freedom Party. “A four-day working week increases the operating costs of companies by 25 percent.” the MP thunders. Unless - as he claims - shorter working hours will be associated with a cut in salary. According to him, the working time in the company depends on the agreement between the employee and the boss. And imposing shorter working hours on them in advance strikes at their freedom. Artur Dziambor also has no doubts that by presenting such a proposal, Tusk is casting a net on the young, more left-wing electorate. He is accompanied by Sławomir Mentzen, president of the Polish Business Congress, member of the KORWiN party. ""If someone thinks that going to work four instead of five days a week increases efficiency, then let them run their company in this way and with this patent they will wipe out the competition from the board,"" Sławomir Mentzen mocked the idea on Facebook."
25100	13	The president of PiS, Jarosław Kaczyński, also referred to the proposal during his visit to Grójec. He mocked that the idea should alarm voters.
25100	15	- They promised a four-day work week. Considering how it's been with their big promises so far, that means it's going to be six days! I can already see it with my mind's eye. First, for two months, four days, then saying: well, the society has not matured, it has not succeeded, but now we have to make up for it, six - said Jarosław Kaczyński.
25100	17	"Beata Mazurek from PiS reminded that PO voted against free Sundays in trade. And now all of a sudden this party wants to be an advocate for reducing working hours. According to her, Tusk is a ""dangerous populist""."
25100	19	"Earlier, Waldemar Buda, the Minister of Development and Technology, did not spare Tusk criticism: “When he was supposed to lower taxes, he increased them. When he was supposed to lower the retirement age, he raised it. I would be afraid if working Saturdays are not hidden behind this solution, ""he said on Polsat News. And he added that PiS also made calculations regarding a four-day working week. He also stated that the current economic situation is not conducive to introducing such changes."
25100	21	Currently, the government is focusing on the implementation of flexible forms of employment, e.g. remote work (a government bill is in the Sejm, it has been submitted to the Sejm Extraordinary Committee). Statutory shortening of the working week is therefore not an option. Marlena Maląg, Minister of Family and Social Policy, reminded Polish Radio that today nothing stands in the way of the employer and employee agreeing on a shorter working time, if necessary.
25100	23	We want to work less. But earn less
25100	25	The proposal to reduce working hours may have electoral potential. According to a Hays survey, 96% of employees like the four-day work model. respondents. On the other hand, a shorter working week and the resulting 80% pay cut were supported by only 19% of respondents. surveyed. Another study, Barometer of the Polish Labor Market, showed that, apart from the medical care package, it is the four-day working week that is the bonus most expected by employees. Donald Tusk's initiative can therefore be treated as an element of the pre-election game. It is also, and not for the first time, winking at the young, left-wing electorate. Another thing is whether the PO is credible in this flirting with a more or less left-wing voter. Tusk, talking about the four-day working week, did not say much. He noted, among other things, that this is not the answer for today and that, taking into account the experience of the pandemic and the automation of work ahead of us, the challenges regarding working time will have to be taken seriously. Simple election promises and expectations of the electorate are one thing, and another - whether such a solution makes sense in our reality.
25100	27	"Various rankings (data vary depending on the research methodology) place us among the busiest nations in Europe. According to the ""Working time in 2019-2020"" report prepared by Eurofound, an average of 1,848 hours were worked in Poland in 2020. In Germany -1574 hours. A detailed survey last year was conducted by UCE Research and Syno Poland. This analysis shows that 21% of employees worked more than 8 hours a day. study participants. In turn, 13 percent respondents worked 9-10 hours, and 8 percent. - more than 10 hours a day (804 professionally active Poles were asked). The Eurostat study shows that in 2021 the average working time in Poland was 40.3 hours. weekly. According to this equation, the Serbs (43.3 hours) and the Greeks (40.6 hours) worked more. The shortest working hours last year were in the Netherlands - on average it was 31.6 hours. weekly. This was followed by Norway (34.2 hours), Denmark (34.8 hours), Germany (35.2 hours). The authors of the study found that the European countries with the most work pay the lowest hourly wages. So will shortening the working time automatically improve its efficiency, and thus economic parameters? That's not how it works, economists say. Shorter working hours and higher wages may be the result of the development of the economy, not its driving force."
25100	29	- The key to reducing working time and maintaining wages is to increase labor productivity. The idea is to create the same value of products or services with less hours of work. And this requires progress in automation, robotization, the use of new technologies and artificial intelligence. Investment is needed in these areas. Shorter work is an inevitable direction the world is heading in, but implementing this direction is a matter of at least a decade. It cannot be done in a revolutionary way, it is an evolutionary, long-term process, says Andrzej Kubisiak, deputy director of the Polish Economic Institute.
25100	31	Poland is not Great Britain
25100	33	So far, no country has decided to introduce a statutory four-day working week. Although, of course, some companies, especially during pandemic restrictions, have made their working hours more flexible. There are also countries where the daily working time has been shortened, e.g. to 7 hours (France). Pilot projects concerning the four-day working week were carried out on a different scale, e.g. in Japan, New Zealand, Iceland. In the latter country, pilots noted that they were more productive, less stressed and better able to balance work and leisure. It should be added here that officials from government institutions and the Reykjavik City Council took part in the test, and the study lasted 4 years. Currently, the experiment is carried out in Spain and Great Britain. The British pilot, which started in June, is the largest to date, covering 3,000. employees from 70 companies. Its participants are to work 32 hours a week for six months, without a reduction in pay. Experts emphasize that even if the solution works in another country, it may not be the case here, or not immediately. The specificity of our economy is different than, for example, the British one. We are dominated by small companies. And it may be more difficult to implement technological changes in them.
25100	35	The share of highly developed sectors in the British economy is higher than in Poland. Our economy is still largely based on sectors where man-hours matter and determine the success of a company. We should wait for the completion of the pilot projects and only then consider such an experiment in Poland - adds Andrzej Kubisiak.
25100	37	"""This idea is harmful"""
25100	39	Shortening working hours in our country may be problematic in some sectors. Especially in those that are struggling with the lack of employees. This applies to the medical industry, for example. If we shorten the working week, the availability of doctors will be smaller, or there will be a fictitious shortening of working time in their case. Medical staff will have to take additional shifts to fill staffing gaps. In fact, it will work the same as it does now. There are also questions about trade or gastronomy? Will entrepreneurs be able to afford to maintain the continuity of their companies if the employee's working week is 4 days?
25100	41	Cezary Kaźmierczak, president of the Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers, has no doubts: the idea is harmful, infantile and detached from reality. And some Polish politicians, not only from PO, when submitting such a postulate, behave as if we were another Switzerland.
25100	43	"“Poland is quite a rich country compared to the rest of the world; but compared to Europe it is no longer the case. So far, Poland has less than 60 percent. Germany's GDP per capita. Germany is one and a half times more efficient than Poland, and also has higher productivity. If we are to continue to effectively chase them, as we have been chasing for 30 years, and reach the standard of living of these rich Western countries, we should work not less, but more, to catch up with them"" - said Cezary Kaźmierczak, quoted by PAP."
25100	45	In the opinion of prof. Jacek Męcina, advisor to the board of Konfederacja Lewiatan, a four-day working week in our conditions would result in a reduction in salaries and a reduction in the number of employees.
25100	47	- Simply reducing the working week from 5 to 4 days means that, in principle, productivity decreases. Therefore, workers' wages should be reduced by about 20 percent. The argument that the reduction of working time will be compensated by an increase in productivity cannot be accepted, because there are no such guarantees and such possibilities are not always possible. The French experience of the late 1980s showed that the reduction of working time was not compensated by the increase in productivity, and the transfer of the costs of such a solution to employers cannot be accepted. This would lead to a reduction in the competitiveness of companies and problems in the entire economy - says prof. Jacek Męcina.
25100	49	According to him, the current time, especially in view of the possible recession, is not the best time for experiments. However, the proposed solution cannot be completely rejected. In automated sectors based on modern technologies, the reduction of working time will be desirable in the future.
25100	51	- In the first place, such space will appear in industrial sectors, but also in modern services. Investments in robotization and process automation mean huge expenses for companies in the first phase. So the question is how we will compensate them for these investments. In addition, we must remember that maintaining employment will increasingly require additional investments in improving or changing the qualifications of employees, and this also means significant expenditures - says prof. Jacek Męcina.
25101	1	Lewicka: Not Moscow and Beijing, but Berlin and Brussels. PiS is still looking for enemies in the West
25101	3	The war in Ukraine has not really changed much in PiS's foreign policy, in thinking about geopolitical threats and challenges for Poland. The power camp is constantly hostage to the anti-German obsession of its leader and superpower stories about great Poland and an equally great army from Vienna or Kircholm.
25101	5	If untrue stories are sold to the public, sooner or later their incompatibility with reality will surface. Like Rydz-Śmigły, who believed that he was the second Piłsudski, that he would not give up even a button to the Third Reich, only to be interned by the Romanians and abandon the troops, still fighting on two fronts at that time, to their fate. Let's follow these smacked dubs of the president and the rest of the rulers.
25101	7	"Germany is an extremely destructive element in Europe, said Jarosław Kaczyński in an interview for ""Gazeta Polska"". He argued that Berlin's goal was to ""keep us under his heel."" He graciously decided that ""today there is no Hitler's madness in them"", but ""if you look at Bismarck, then - taking into account other historical circumstances, of course - the goals are the same."""
25101	9	"It should be recalled here that Bismarck was not only the creator of the power of the Second Reich, but also the driving force behind the brutal Germanization of the lands under Prussian rule. So has the PiS president noticed a new ""Kulturkampf"" in Berlin's politics now?"
25101	11	"Recently Kaczyński was bizarrely backed up by none other than the president of the National Bank of Poland. Adam Glapiński argued, probably strongly consternated financial markets, that one of our neighbors (then the word ""Germany"" was mentioned) plans to trick Poland into the euro zone in order to build a European federation in six months and deprive us of our sovereignty."
25101	13	"This is a slightly modified echo of the president's words spoken at the rally in Kielce. The president said there that Germany is not a superpower, but if they used the EU as ""stilts"", they would be, and we, in turn, would be under their shoe, and ""a shoe is a shoe"". PiS also returns to the narrative about reparations, which it has no chance of getting, and which demand it has been unable to make for years, because the report on this subject is allegedly ""translated into many languages"". It is astonishing that PiS is unable to reach for the money from the Reconstruction Fund, and deceives us with unrealistic compensation from Berlin."
25101	15	"In fact, it is also difficult to follow Kaczyński in his thinking about the western neighbor. Sometimes it's a power wanting to swallow us, other times it's only at our expense that it plans to push itself to power. Sometimes Germans are funny, other times they are threatening. In one city, Kaczyński claims that Germany is an economic superpower, in another he shrugs his shoulders that the purchasing power of one euro is about three zlotys, so not that much, and Polish doctors no longer work there because ""they pay less than here ""."
25101	17	The president's fear of the German is mixed with complexes towards the German. And on top of all this, there is a political game to incite the public against Berlin, because it is known that PiS cannot exist, act and campaign without an enemy.
25101	19	Without an imaginary enemy that does not really exist and with which you do not have to fight at all. Only such enemies can PiS defeat like a knight errant from La Mancha looking for dangerous opponents in windmills.
25101	21	The real enemy - Russia returns mainly in the propaganda spreading of inflation as the main and almost the only cause of price increases in Poland and throughout Europe. And besides, Berlin and Brussels want our sovereignty more than Moscow. And China, allied with Russia, in general, especially to President Duda, seems to be an attractive colleague to do politics and business.
25101	23	Let's move on. This reversal of directions from which evil can come is accompanied by constant crowing about our power - political and military. We will never again allow a Russian soldier to set foot on Polish soil - the Prime Minister blows the banner of national pride. But you can always count on the president in such matters. Poland is large enough to have a place to bury the attackers, he threatened just after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.
25101	25	PiS is waving a law on the defense of the homeland in front of the public's nose, which so far has nothing to do with it, except for quick purchases, without a plan, but on the credit of future generations, and military plans to enlarge the army, questioned by many.
25101	27	Kaczyński sees the Polish army huge, and this is also supposed to tickle us nationally. And if it came to anything, it would be necessary to refer to what Andrzej Duda himself had mentioned when asked about Putin's possible aggression against Poland.
25101	29	There is a potential threat, he replied, but please note that over 10,000 soldiers of the world's largest army are present in Poland. The most powerful, best and most modernly equipped army. So it is, as always, first Poland is a power, and that's it, we don't have a button here and so on, and a moment later we nervously look for the Americans. Phew, there are, and there are even more of them lately. What a relief!
25101	31	Here, however, it is enough to recall that at the end of last year, having at its disposal US intelligence findings about the impending Russian aggression against Ukraine, PiS went to war with the Americans over TVN. Because internal party goals were more important for President Kaczyński than good relations with our possible main defender.
25101	33	"Not only is PiS incapable of conducting foreign policy, because there are the same losers in the diplomatic service as in any other job taken over by the party. Also because he puts party interests above raison d'état. Those who are relieved that PiS took the right side after February 24 should not forget that this war is ""political gold"" for PiS."
25101	35	This can be seen in the attempts to militarize the public debate, which is intended to divert public attention from high prices and other ills. The fact that one Lech Kaczyński accurately predicted Russian plans does not mean that PiS has learned or understood anything. It remains to be hoped that history will never test their effectiveness as it did Rydz-Śmigły.
25102	1	Call the caravan. Greta Thunberg killed those who wipe their mouths with ecology
25102	3	The youth forum Youth4Climate, which is taking place in Milan, was yesterday an opportunity for Greta Thunberg to make a strong comeback. This time we didn't hear the jittery teenager anymore. I have the impression that a serious leader of a new generation is being born.
25102	5	"Like Hamlet saying ""words, words, words"", Greta Thunberg from the very first words hit the world leaders and the empty platitudes they have been uttering for years regarding the fight against climate change. Blah, blah, blah with an admixture of words about plans, about climate neutrality, about ambitions - that's all we hear from their mouths."
25102	7	How much truth is in her statement. People who follow all the information about the climate economy and the new effects of climate change emerging in the world know exactly what Greta Thunberg had in mind.
25102	9	In the last two decades, a kind of newspeak has been created that has become a mandatory element in press releases by representatives of industry and governments of many countries.
25102	11	There are now no messages that do not refer to climate change. Almost every large company feels obliged to ensure that it aims to minimize or even eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 2040 or 2050. However, as Thunberg notes, these are beautiful words that are not followed by any actions.
25102	13	Importantly, Thunberg has concrete evidence to support his thesis about the hypocrisy of power.
25102	15	For years we have been hearing about actions taken to protect the climate. At the same time, the data points to the exact opposite: half of all atmospheric emissions occurred in the last 30 years. One third - in the last 15 years. At the same time, we have become accustomed to the newspeak about plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
25102	17	"Very often the phrase ""we will achieve X or Y by 2030"" is carte blanche for companies to do nothing here and now. ""After all, we have committed to reducing emissions by 2030, so if you need anything, ask us in 2031, and now leave us alone."""
25102	19	Meanwhile, the situation is dramatic right now, here and now.
25102	21	Greta Thunberg admits that currently we do not have technologies that we could simply switch to in order not to disturb the economy, and at the same time drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
25102	23	But that doesn't mean we should work on these technologies and do nothing in the meantime. If we don't have technology - it's hard. We need to change our lifestyles to reduce emissions as much as possible now, perhaps giving scientists a few more years to develop technologies that will allow us to switch to a zero-carbon economy. Someone will have to bear these costs. If we take them now, they will be many times lower than if we start them in a decade or two.
25102	25	Will it be inconvenient? Of course. Will people be outraged? Of course. No one likes to be deprived of the comforts to which they are accustomed. This convenience, however, cannot be more important than the fate of future generations, who, instead of enjoying life, will struggle with the effects of our egocentrism. They will have no choice, because they will be born in a world completely destroyed by our ignorance.
25102	27	Greta Thunberg knows what she's talking about
25102	29	Just look at the reactions after Greta Thunberg's speech. The fact that the eighteen-year-old tells the brutal truth does not please the majority of society, which people widely vent in the comments. The problem, however, is that she is right, not the majority of society.
25102	31	Listening to Greta Thunberg's speech, however, I see that she has evolved a lot in just a few years. The message is clearer, there is no longer a note of jitteriness in the voice, but a hard note of contempt for hypocrites sitting on the boards of companies and politicians who together destroy the earth's atmosphere, while throwing out further declarations of intentions to eliminate emissions by one year or another. What's more, the organizers of the event itself, the Italian government, were also hit.
25102	33	I have no illusions as to whether the words of Greta Thunberg will penetrate the consciousness of those in power. It will probably end only with further declarations. Then everyone will go home, and companies will continue to increase CO2 emissions as they do.
25102	35	However, this does not change the fact that from year to year we will find out how serious - in the context of climate - the situation we are in. When we pay more and more compensation for losses caused by natural disasters, which are a direct result of climate change, year after year, we will certainly start to act. Only one question remains: will it be too late then?
25103	1	"Where has Greta Thunberg gone? ""We won't wait for him to say something"""
25103	3	The Youth Climate Strike was at the peak of popularity, attracting millions of people to protests, when suddenly the pandemic broke out and took it from the streets to the Internet. Then Zoom became the new meeting platform.
25103	5	The online meetings were attended by activists from Europe and the United States, but also from Africa, Asia and South America. “It was the first opportunity to finally meet people from the climate movement from other parts of the world. During these meetings, we were able to talk to activists from Uganda, the Philippines and India - people who have not been listened to as much as people from Europe. Then we began to discover that for people from those countries where climate change is already very severe, it is not a fight for the future, but to save what is left. – says Dominika Lasota from the Youth Climate Strike in Poland.
25103	7	"Mitzi Jonelle Tan, an activist from the Philippines, told Politico that ""We're not just fighting for our future, we're fighting for our present."" Disha Ravi, an activist from India, felt that the environmental movement was ""whitewashed"" and thanks to Zoom, she and Mitzi were able to point out to their colleagues their ignorance of poorer countries."
25103	9	— For us, the climate crisis is associated with ecology, environmental devastation, but for my friend from Uganda, the climate crisis is something much bigger - it is the result of decades of colonization of her country by European countries, it is the result of racism, which deprived her ancestors of cultural capital and finally - it is a constant experience of further plundering of Africa's natural resources,” explains Dominika Lasota.
25103	11	"“If it wasn't for these online meetings, where national borders were not a barrier, the youth movement would not have gained all the perspectives that go beyond Europe - beyond being a white man in a privileged, safe country. As a movement, we have discovered that the climate crisis is in fact one of the effects of wider social injustice - the exploitation of various countries and communities by ""Western"" states and corporations - admits the activist."
25103	13	Differences in the approach to climate change due to socio-economic and racial factors that stood out among activists on Zoom are confirmed by Yale University research from 2019 and 2020. They show that Hispanics and African Americans (69 and 57, respectively, according to numbers) percent) are more concerned about climate change than white people; in this case, it's one person in two.
25103	15	On the wave of activists' conversations about social injustices, the Youth Climate Strike decided to add one more to its demands: climate justice. The new postulate, apart from demanding that countries conduct climate policy and transform the economy in order to reduce greenhouse gases, is currently the most important priority of the Strike.
25103	17	– It is often said that a climate catastrophe is facing us all, but the climate crisis is not a crisis to which we have all contributed equally. Africa accounts for 4 percent. all greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The vast majority were produced by Western Europe and the United States. However, when we look at who is most affected by this, we have the complete opposite - North America and Western Europe are the least affected by climate change, and Africa has been dealing with it for decades - explains the activist from Poland.
25103	19	According to data from the Global Adaptation Center report from 2021, every third inhabitant of Africa (by 2030) will experience poverty due to climate change.
25103	21	The postulate of climate justice means that countries and companies that have contributed to climate change should bear responsibility and take action to stop the devastation of nature. “First, oil companies should drop all new investments in fossil fuels. New projects exploiting gas, oil or coal make this crisis even worse. Currently, as Youth Climate Strike, we are campaigning against the French company Total Energies. Total is building its longest ever pipeline in Uganda. It's 2022, various European leaders support demands to end the era of fossil fuels, but despite this, fuel companies - with the support of politicians - continue their work anyway and, what's worse, they are looking for new regions where they can further damage the natural environment - explains Lasota.

25103	25	"The activist emphasizes that such investments negatively affect the climate and further deepen social injustices. ""The construction of a new pipeline in Uganda will deprive some people of their homes, some will live next to the polluter, while people from Europe will not lose anything,"" he adds."
25103	27	"Thus, the Climate Strike also demands that countries that are already suffering from the climate crisis receive money, something like climate reparations, from the countries that exploit them. ""And it's not supposed to be a loan, a form of credit, because that would still create an unequal relationship between the two, but payment for the damage done - for the historical consequences of this terrible system that Western Europe and the United States have built,"" the activist says."
25103	29	The organization Africa No Filter (ANF), which fights against stereotypes and negative narratives about Africa, conducted a study in April this year, analyzing online media, Twitter posts and Google searches from October and September 2021 in terms of what is happening writes and speaks about Africa. The analysis showed that although Africa is the face of the global climate crisis, the voices of Africans - environmental activists, climate analysts and scientists - are absent from the environmental debate. Only European rhetoric about the climate crisis, including Greta Thunberg, gets through to the international media.
25103	31	"Activists from third countries talked about the ""problem"" with Greta during meetings on Zoom. They complained that their voice in ecology debates was overlooked when those more privileged, like Greta, could say whatever they wanted. The Swedish activist already admitted a year ago, during a youth conference in Italy before COP26 (UN Conference on Climate Change - ed.), that she was ""a selected young person"", but added that ""they pretended to listen to her""."
25103	33	— Greta Thunberg is a white girl from Sweden, one of the most privileged countries in the world, who inspired millions of young people to do the same with her solo climate protests. But although she touched millions, in my opinion, she was treated by many as a famous person worth showing up with. Especially politicians did everything to have a picture with Greta, but they did not take seriously what she said. If that were the case, we would not be talking about building a pipeline in Uganda, or the European Union would not continue to finance gas, oil and coal from Russia, says Lasota.
25103	35	Dominika explains that Greta, after talking on Zoom with activists from around the world, and above all with those from Africa and Asia, decided not to get involved in the media. She made it clear within the movement that she didn't want to draw all the attention to herself. She decided that our colleagues from Uganda or the Philippines would be better able to talk about the climate crisis, because they are the ones who have to deal with it every day - they lack drinking water, their land is depleted, they live with heavy industry, which it provides us with comfort - explains the Polish activist.
25103	37	Now the goal of the Youth Climate Strike is that as many climate activists as possible, from the most affected regions of the world, have the opportunity to speak out in the media. “We want people who are most affected by the effects of the fossil fuel industry to be listened to as often as possible. We are trying to ensure that these people meet with politicians, with people who are responsible for destructive investments in their countries - says Lasota.
25103	39	"Among the examples showing how Greta has become synonymous with climate strikes, ""Politico"" mentioned the situation when during one of the conferences ""Fridays For Future"" the camera was directed all the time at the Swede, although she was not the speaker; another activist spoke, but the media was not interested. The message from the press was simple: It doesn't matter what the climate activists have to say, the only thing that matters is whether Greta says it."
25103	41	"Dominika Lasota admits: the climate crisis existed in the media only when Greta went out somewhere and said something or when there were strikes. ""Now that Greta is on the sidelines, not wanting to be the face of climate justice, our media movement is dying,"" he said."
25103	43	Despite this, Greta Thunberg continues her policy of staying behind and is not attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this year. Instead, other representatives of the Youth Climate Strike appeared.
25103	45	“Although Greta has faded into the background, we are still a movement of people who believe change is possible, with or without Greta. We want our movement not to be treated as a part of an interesting story about a girl from Sweden, but rather that actions be taken against the climate crisis because of us. We often repeat in movement that another world is possible. Because it is. And now we are creating it,” sums up Lasota.
25103	47	We're using up the planet too fast. Greta's five steps: how to repay an ecological loan
25103	49	"Most of the media mentions of Greta come from November 2021. At that time, Katarzyna Tubylewicz, a writer and translator of Swedish literature, published the text ""Swedes are starting to have a problem with Greta Thunberg"" in the ""Polityka"" weekly."
25103	51	In it, the writer referred to the critical voices towards Greta, who is accused by part of society in Sweden of being too critical of politics. Greta, starting her climate strike at the age of 15, turned to politicians and directed all her attention to them, wanting to force them to act in the name of the climate. This resulted in Greta's meetings with the leaders of many countries; she met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron.
25103	53	Millions of people joined her attempts to call politicians to change, seeing it as hope for change. Now, when Greta argues that politics will not change anything, some of these people have the impression that the previous actions were for nothing, since their initiator herself lost hope.
25103	55	She has a lot of influence and there are publicists - in Sweden and not only - who believe that she should become a mature leader, capable of compromise and politics - said Tubylewicz during a broadcast on Tok Fm radio in November 2021. The writer reminded that Thunberg never had political ambitions, and all she had to do with politics was trying to talk to politicians about climate.
25103	57	Currently, Greta Thunberg makes herself known sporadically. In his social media, he mainly publishes photos from weekly Fridays for the climate or protests against the war in Ukraine. The exception is the information about her plans to publish a book on the climate crisis, which she posted on Facebook.
25103	59	"The book, entitled ""The Climate Book"", is intended to be an overview of the problems and challenges that face us as inhabitants of the Earth. In its pages, the 19-year-old wants to give the floor to 100 people: experts and activists who are no strangers to the fight for the good of the planet. Among them were the scientist Katharine Hayhoe, the economist Thomas Piketty, the Kenyan ecologist Wanjira Mathai and the novelist Margerat Atwood, known as the author of The Handmaid's Tale."
25103	61	We have used all the Earth's resources for 2021. From now on, we live on credit
25103	63	"I decided to use my platform to create a book based on the best science available today - a book that holistically addresses the climate, environmental and sustainability crises,"" Thunberg wrote in a statement. ""The climate crisis is, of course, only a symptom of a much larger sustainability crisis. My hope is that this book can be a guide to understanding these various, closely related crises."""
25103	65	The book will be released in the UK in late October and in the US in early 2023.
25103	67	"The 19-year-old Swede identifies herself as a climate activist with Asperger's. In 2018, she launched a ""school strike for climate""; instead of going to school, she appeared in front of the Swedish parliament every Friday, urging politicians to take action against negative climate change. Among its postulates was the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere."
25103	69	After solo strikes and the teenager's attitude circulated in the world media, the girl grew up to be a global climate activist. In the same year that she started the protest, she was invited to the climate summit in Katowice and initiated the Youth Climate Strike. In 2018, Time magazine placed her on the list of the 25 most influential teenagers in the world, and a year later she became the youngest Person of the Year.
25104	1	Greta Thunberg. Climate symbol without meaning [COMMENT]
25104	3	Although the young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg attracts the attention of the media and societies around the world, from the point of view of climate protection her activities are practically irrelevant.
25104	5	Greta Thunberg is known almost all over the world. This Swedish teenager became famous for skipping school on Fridays for the climate - skipping school to protest alone in front of the parliament in Stockholm to protect the planet. In just a dozen or so months, the girl has become a global icon for environmentalists and activists who want to stop climate change. Greta has appeared before parliaments, in world economic forums, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and a few days ago she set off on a sailing yacht on a journey across the Atlantic to participate in climate conferences in New York and Santiago.
25104	7	Admittedly, that's quite an impressive list of accomplishments for a sixteen-year-old.
25104	9	However, from the point of view of Greta's main goal - saving the climate - her activities remain irrelevant all the time. Sometimes it can even hurt the whole thing.
25104	11	"The author of these words is aware of the indignation and anger that they may cause, but hopes that readers will at least calm down while reading this article. Then they can get indignant and angry at will. In addition, the author would like to emphasize at the outset that it is not the so-called He is a ""climate denialist"", on the contrary: he considers climate change to be the greatest challenge facing humanity. And that is one of the reasons why he sees Miss Thunberg's impotence and the futility and even the dark side of all the turmoil she has caused. So let's get to the point."
25104	13	Children, children, come play with the soldiers
25104	15	"In her speech at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, Greta said, ""I don't want hope... I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear that I feel every day. And only then do I want you to act. I want you to act as if you acted in a crisis. As if our house was on fire. Because it's on fire."""
25104	17	It's hard to disagree with Greta's diagnosis. In fact, the pace of climate change, its scope and force bring to mind the metaphor of a burning house. However, humanity has been well aware of this for years. World leaders draw knowledge on this subject, for example, from the activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which regularly publishes reports signaling the need for extensive action in this area.
25104	19	Every year, the COP climate summit is convened under the aegis of the UN (last year it was held in Katowice). Climate protection was to be supported by such international documents as the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. The American Pentagon regularly prepares studies analyzing the impact of climate change on global security. Pacific island states regularly appeal through their diplomatic channels for increased efforts to protect the climate, as climate change poses a direct, existential threat to these countries.
25104	21	Humanity is aware of the seriousness of the climate problem. So why is there no solution on the horizon? Why has the world been emitting more and more carbon dioxide almost continuously for 40 years? Why are new coal-emission power plants being built all over the planet and efficient and clean nuclear units being shut down?
25104	23	Well, probably because, as history shows, getting things done is not easy and takes time. It is worth recalling the example of the so-called the ozone hole, i.e. the phenomenon of a decrease in ozone concentration in the stratosphere, caused by the use of CFC-12 freon for the production of, among others, aerosols, refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.
25104	25	This problem was signaled by science in the early 1980s and has since been fought by the international community. In 1985, the Vienna Convention on the protection of the ozone layer was adopted, and two years later the Montreal Protocol was signed, thanks to which all UN member states introduced restrictive limits on the emission of substances that deplete the ozone layer (which in turn allowed to reduce the production of some of them by 90%, the decrease also affected CFC-12 - it was committed to phase out its production, by 2012 its emissions fell five times).
25104	27	"Only recent research has shown that the ozone hole is disappearing, and its ""sealing"" may take place in the second half of the 21st century (unless no one breaks the legal rigors established in this matter). It can therefore be said that it will take less than a hundred years for conscious humanity to settle a relatively simple matter (requiring ""only"" the withdrawal of a certain substance and its replacement with another, fully available technology)."
25104	29	Meanwhile, climate change is - as mentioned above - the greatest challenge facing humanity. The importance of this problem lies in its complexity, in its deep roots in the structure of the modern world, in its incredibly extensive network of connections and dependencies that make the entire global civilization tremble if it undertakes a strenuous and fast march in the wrong direction. That's why you have to explore different ways, taking into account the necessity of taking a few steps back.
25104	31	"It is easy to shout: ""Let's get away from coal!"". But it is much more difficult to say what we should replace this raw material with, how to force countries dependent on its combustion to turn off their furnaces and power plants, how to persuade developing countries not to reach for this cheap and easy to extract and store raw material. And yet all of the above issues are just the surface of a whole lake of questions that need to be answered before action can begin."
25104	33	It took several decades of development of renewable energy sources to see that these capacities would not effectively replace conventional units or improve the situation, for example, in African countries. It took trillions of dollars for the electric car industry to realize that they are displacing cars with internal combustion engines only in very wealthy societies or where buyers can count on huge subsidies and incentives. It took dozens of climate conferences and agreements to notice that the existing arrangements resulting from them are not effective in terms of reducing global carbon dioxide emissions.
25104	35	The author of this text is of the opinion that the coming decades will bring further conclusions and observations regarding the fight against climate change, for example in terms of the role of nuclear energy or in terms of involvement in improving the energy sectors of developing countries. He also believes that only the next few years, or even generations, will bring a breakthrough in thinking about fighting climate change and in fighting this problem.
25104	37	"Currently, however, we are stuck in a powerful impasse, as evidenced by the graph of global CO2 emissions. And panic is not a good solution here. Meanwhile, Greta pushes the style of talking about climate change, which can be well described in the words of Przemysław Gintrowski's song ""Witkacy's Self-Portrait"": I am afraid of the destruction of the world. So to improve the mood. I scream like a child in a dark locked room."
25104	39	"The matter is further complicated by the fact that the climate issue has been drawn into the current political game for good. The slogan of protecting the planet often serves more as a party slogan than a sincere declaration of taking real action. In this field, the example of Germany shines particularly brightly, which - under the guise of the ""green"" transformation - closes down its efficient nuclear power plants and tries to prevent new units of this type from being built in the European Union. ""Panic"" activists and people who care about the good of the climate can easily fall for this type of ecomask."
25104	41	If, after reading this passage, someone still believes that the figure of the 16-year-old activist is the recipe for the above problems, it is worth reaching back to the quite recent past and recalling the person of Samantha Reed Smith, an American schoolgirl who in 1982 (at the age of 10) wrote a letter to Yuri Andropov, sharing his concerns about the nuclear war between the US and the USSR.
25104	43	"Samantha quickly became famous, gained the attention of the world media, visited the Soviet Union, wrote a book and was hailed as an ""ambassador of peace"". The girl did not live to see the end of the Cold War, she died in a plane crash in 1985, but even her biggest supporters are unable to admit that Samantha really contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc or the end of the struggle between Moscow and Washington. What happened after 1989 was the result of a wide-ranging policy, consistently pursued by the US and its allies, honed and perfected over the decades, and crowned with a brilliant program developed by President Ronald Reagan and his administration."
25104	45	"Who knows how the fate of the world would have turned out if the United States government had listened to the voices of various groups that, in accordance with their lofty ideas, wanted to make ""love, not war"" and called for, among others, to extensive nuclear disarmament."
25104	47	Effectiveness requires calm, subtle and detailed consideration of all circumstances, many trials and experiments, perfecting methods and the ability to anticipate errors.
25104	49	Nothing new
25104	51	"“All right,” one of Greta's supporters will say. ""The girl may not influence politicians, but she will raise awareness of voters about climate change, and they will already choose the right people or start doing something about it themselves."" Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence that increased awareness of certain risks or harmful effects of certain activities does not translate into their reduction, combat or avoidance."
25104	53	Obesity and overweight can serve as an example. In Europe, practically all people who finish at least primary school are aware that these ailments have a devastating impact on health and life. Equally common is knowledge about the causes of these conditions, such as poor diet or lack of exercise. Information on proper nutrition and the need to take care of one's physical condition comes not only from the school education process, but also from the media, pop culture and social campaigns.
25104	55	In addition, virtually every packaged food product has the energy value expressed in calories on its packaging, which makes it easier to balance the diet. Therefore, it can be said with full responsibility that the awareness of the causes, importance and effects of overweight and obesity is very wide. Unfortunately, it does not translate into the fight against these ailments - according to the data of the European Commission, the percentage of the population struggling with weight problems is growing drastically in the vast majority of EU countries.
25104	57	The same applies to other factors directly affecting people's lives and health. The common awareness of the harmfulness of smoking did not eliminate this addiction in societies, the same scenario met the common awareness of the harmfulness of alcohol abuse. Every driver asked on the street would certainly confirm that he is aware of the dangers that driving under the influence of alcohol brings to him and other road users, and yet the police detain thousands of drunk car users every year, and those who fail to stop in time injure and kill themselves and others.
25104	59	So if people, although aware of the harmfulness of their own actions, can bring harm or danger directly to themselves, is it reasonable to count on them not to bring such harm or danger to the climate?
25104	61	"Other supporters of Greta assure that her person will touch the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world, including decision makers, prompting them to act for the climate. Well, taking these words at face value, one should admit that, for example, the war in Syria costing hundreds of thousands of lives, which was caused, among others, by effects of climate change, had less potential to ""touch hearts"" than the 16-year-old girl who is now sailing across the Atlantic aboard a luxury racing yacht."
25104	63	Greta - the superhero of the Facebook era
25104	65	Climate issues are a comfortable space to meet the needs of the psyche in terms of thinking about oneself as a good person. People want to see themselves as smart, helpful and good, they want to support great things that increase their self-esteem.
25104	67	All this makes the climate more and more often a breeding ground for slacktivists - people who support a given cause in a simple and non-engaging way, just to improve their well-being thanks to belonging to a given movement. Slacktivism was, for example, the Bring Back Our Girls campaign, conducted in social media after the kidnapping of 276 Nigerian schoolgirls by the Boko Haram organization in 2014. Although millions of people around the world (including Michelle Obama, the then First Lady of the USA) joined the campaign consisting in posting photos with the title of the action on Internet portals, almost half of the abducted girls are still wanted.
25104	69	Side effects
25104	71	Greta's activity also has side effects, consisting in distracting from the climate issue all those for whom the elevation of a 16-year-old girl to the status of a symbol of the fight against climate change seems at least grotesque. Creating an atmosphere of panic around climate change can also have a similar effect - as Dr. Tomasz Rożek said in an interview with the Energetyka24 website, it is impossible to convince anyone to a given issue permanently with the help of fear.
25104	73	The zeal of Greta's defenders in attacking all those who dare to criticize or even doubt the sense of her activities also played a role in this matter. The old adage says that the end justifies the means – it is impossible not to get the impression that in the case of the Swedish activist, her noble cause sanctified her during her lifetime. What Greta does and says can only be said in superlatives.
25104	75	A clear example of such a situation is the attack on the editor of one of the German newspapers, who described Greta's yacht trip across the Atlantic, stating that it is more emission-intensive than a plane flight, because part of the crew will return from America by airlines, which will have a more negative impact on the atmosphere than if Greta went overseas by air. Such a statement - although supported by evidence - was met with a violent and aggressive reaction from readers, who called the journalist in the comments under his article and on his social media.
25104	77	By the way, the facts described by him make Greta's voyage quite comical, which also affects the social reception of the whole event.
25104	79	We need activism 2.0
25104	81	So let's sum up: Greta's activities will not stop climate change. The young activist will not stop the process of shutting down German nuclear power plants, will not shut down Chinese coal-fired power plants, will not solve the energy problems of Third World countries. The mythical “climatic social awareness” that sometimes shows the features of slacktivism turns out to be just as ineffective.
25104	83	One might ask: then why engage in any kind of climate activism at all? After all, taking into account the above premises, it can be assumed from the ground up that nothing can be done, that all efforts are doomed to failure.
25104	85	As it was mentioned above, the world is stuck in a climatic impasse that will probably be broken, but in the future and by means other than those used so far, because these are simply ineffective, focused on fragments of the whole. The same applies to activism - those actions that work in points, in the case of individual cities or regions, do not produce results on a global scale (which does not take away the sense of activity on a microscale).
25104	87	Greta's activity does not solve this problem at all. At most, her movement can serve as an ark that will transport energy and social commitment into the future, to a new form of activism - but this is unlikely, because the world seems to like this (ineffective and burning its own potential) form of action. Meanwhile, it must be remembered that the vehicle is only a means, not a goal, and in itself will not be a recipe for climate change.
25104	89	And the formula for effective climate activism, activism 2.0, which is comprehensive and sublime enough to deal with the behemoth of climate change, has yet to be invented. Avoiding the question of effectiveness by hiding behind the figure of a 16-year-old girl is not a step in this direction.

25105	5	Greta Thunberg at the United Nations
25105	7	"Over 185 million - this is the result indicated by the Google search engine when we enter the search term ""Greta Thunberg"" in it. This number is growing every day. This alone shows that we are dealing with a global media phenomenon. No matter what she does, Greta Thunberg is watched and quoted. The media is drinking the words out of her mouth."
25105	9	"She is called a climate activist who started the ""Fridays for Future"" movement, inspiring millions of young people to become more involved in the fight against climate change."
25105	11	Greta Thunberg meets heads of state, speaks at the UN, receives awards. She is already among the 100 most influential people in the world. Biographies are being written about her, and there is even a book of her speeches. And all this at the age of just 16!
25105	13	How it's possible? Most of what he says isn't really new. In fact, she keeps pointing it out herself. He does not claim any discovery. Instead, she calls on people to finally take note of what has been known for a long time and what she believes has been sufficiently scientifically proven and to take appropriate action. So why her? And where does all this media hype come from?
25105	15	The child in the picture has spoken
25105	17	There have been many times in the past when something was in the air, when something was ripe. And then someone appears on the horizon who points to it and who articulates it - visibly and understandably for everyone. As if the zeitgeist found a spokesman. In this case, it's a spokeswoman, sixteen.
25105	19	She is young and looks even younger. When he speaks to us, he looks at us with the face of a child. Many people are deeply moved by this. Many cultures know such cases. In the Christian world, it is the baby who saves humanity. In Nepal, selected girls are worshiped until maturity as Kumari - child deities. Children are considered innocent and pure. They tell the truth that adults try to ignore or hide. Or, from another point of view, they make the truth visible.
25105	21	US President Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg in New York
25105	23	And here she is, Greta Thunberg, a child of our time who speaks the truth. Which looks us adults in the eye and calls us liars. And we watch spellbound, clapping and visualizing our wishes, longings and fears in her form. We see a child who will save us. Hosanna!
25105	25	Now we can comfortably stretch out in the chair and relax.
25105	27	The black and white truth
25105	29	However, Greta Thunberg has another important feature that is responsible for this global hype. She is a master of escalation and simplification. This is a trait he shares with many populists.
25105	31	It is difficult to find another area of ​​scientific research that is as complicated and imprecise in its analyzes and results as climate research. But in Greta's speeches, everything is reduced to apparent clarity and ease, as if it were Newton's laws of motion.
25105	33	Commentary by Zoran Arbutina
25105	35	"“Start listening to the scientists at last,” he urges, as if there were no those among them who perceive the climate issue in a slightly more complex way. Greta Thunberg draws the world in only two colors - black and white, everything in between is rejected. He has radical answers to complex questions. It calls for action, here and now. No time to think or doubt. ""Don't think about it, just act, our house is on fire!"" – here is a message that everyone understands."
25105	37	Greta Thunberg has a clear and urgent message. Just right for Twitter. Optimal for the media world that loves flashy headlines and demands simplification. This is what makes it so effective.
25105	39	On her way to the UN Climate Summit in New York, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg stopped in the Rhineland lignite basin. She left shocked. (11/08/2019)

25108	5	Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg quickly became the most famous climate activist in the world. The media does not want to write who is behind it.
25108	7	"On the cover of Time, her photo read: ""Teenage Girl Strikes for the Planet."" The Guardian called her ""a ray of hope"" and The New Yorker noted that thanks to the young Swede, ""climate change has become a topic of daily conversation"". ID magazine wrote on its front page about Greta: ""The Girl Who Changed the World."""
25108	9	"In June's ""Wysokie Obcasy"" she was also on the cover with the alarming title ""Our house is on fire"". A text similar to many others in foreign media - about how 15-year-old Greta Thunberg practically launched a global action in defense of the climate herself. The author writes: “There is no staff to help her in the daily duties of the most influential eco-activist in the world. Her parents' help is enough for her."""

25108	17	"– I got a tip – explains Ingmar Rentzhog, a communication and PR expert who was the first to inform the world via social media that on August 20, 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg started a school strike for the climate. ""I thought it was going to be a big demonstration, and she was sitting outside the parliament all alone,"" says Rentzhog. He is the Swedish Environmental Influencer of the Year."
25108	19	"He does not want to reveal the source of his information. On the day of Greta's first school strike, Ingmar Rentzhog wrote in a personal Facebook post about having had an ""emotional morning"". He describes that it was with a heavy heart that he left his three-year-old son in the new kindergarten, and on his way to work, he met a girl ""alone protesting against the whole world"" outside the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament)."
25108	21	“Only one passer-by took a leaflet from her during the time I was there. No one but me spoke to her! This is how anyone who understands that we are dealing with a burning climate crisis can feel. Everyone around lives as usual, although the world will fall apart in a moment. What's the point of pretending nothing is happening? Greta is right. Gather your courage. Come to parliament. Talk to Greta and show that she is not alone. She needs your support,” Rentzhog appealed. Result: nearly 10 thousand. likes.
25108	23	"The entry was accompanied by three photos of a sad Greta holding a banner with the inscription ""School strike for the climate"" and the hashtag #WeDontHaveTime - which is used by the joint-stock company founded by Rentzhog and the We Don't Have Time foundation. Their goal is to build ""the world's largest community platform on climate issues."" It is to enable participants to exchange views, follow trends, and entrepreneurs to promote environmentally friendly solutions."
25108	25	"The world learns about Greta on the same day - m. thanks to the 38-second film produced by We Don't Have Time collaborators, in which a teenager talks about her action in English in front of the parliament. A professional press release is also created for foreign media, available on the Medium.com platform. The next day, Rentzhog enthusiastically writes on his Facebook page: ""The school strike has proven to be one of the most effective ways to spread awareness about climate issues not only in Sweden, but also in the world."" He gives proof: his first post about Greta reached 1 million users on social media."
25108	27	Over 4 million on #ClimateStrike today. In 163 countries. And counting...— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 21, 2019
25108	29	BOOK
25108	31	Greta Thunberg became fearful of climate change after watching an educational film about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch at school. She was eight years old at the time, became depressed, stopped eating and going to school. Concerned parents sought help for a long time, visiting dozens of doctor's offices.
25108	33	"Mother and father are important in this story. Malena Ernman is an opera singer and singer (she represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest), Svante Thunberg is an actor and producer. Ingmar Rentzhog swears today that on that fateful day of Greta's strike, he knew nothing about her parents. He also claims that he did not know about the book ""Scenes from the Heart"" published just a few days earlier by Greta's family, which is their personal manifesto for saving the climate."
25108	35	And it is in this book that the parents openly admit that their daughter's refusal to eat and the significant weight loss was the turning point that started the ecological revolution in the family. Mr. and Mrs. Ernman-Thunberg describe how all four of them (Greta has an even younger sister, Beata) stopped using disposable packaging, buying new, unnecessary things and flying planes. Under the influence of their daughter, the parents also bought an electric car and became vegetarian.
25108	37	"From the book you can also learn that the climate movement that Greta started was invented by her father Svante Thunberg. A few years ago, he abandoned his acting career in favor of publishing articles and giving lectures on the climate crisis. While in London with his younger daughter, Beata, Svante observes tourists from around the world taking selfies by the Tower Bridge and ""dreams of a climate movement that doesn't exist yet, because it has yet to be formed."""
25108	39	There is also information in the book that Greta cannot attend school normally because she has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. The fact that despite these burdens, or maybe even because of them, the young Swedish woman fights for the good of the planet was particularly captivated by the media.
25108	41	Greta's first protest in the second half of August last year. coincided with the beginning of the school year in Sweden and followed the extinguishing of the largest forest fires caused by drought in this part of Europe in years. It was also the end of the election campaign for the Swedish parliament. Initially, the action was to have a local dimension and last until the election day, i.e. September 9, 2018. This procedure helped to interest the Swedish media, which, looking for original pre-election topics, quickly appeared on the spot. Photos of Greta striking alone went around the world.
25108	43	Initially, reports from the strike did not mention either Greta's known parents or the book published by the Ernman-Thunberg family. In the material of the public television SVT there was information that the girl's father refused to appear in front of the camera. He did not want to – reports the journalist – answer the question of whether his daughter should not be at school at that time. He only appealed to the media to focus more on climate threats.
25108	45	Contrary to announcements, Greta Thunberg will not end her campaign after the autumn parliamentary elections. On Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (today she has hundreds of entries, millions of followers) she began to inform that from now on she will go on strike in front of the parliament every Friday.
25108	47	Her posts are regular and quite professional for a 15-year-old. They document subsequent stages of the protest also outside Stockholm, e.g. in Helsinki, Copenhagen and Berlin – the activist reaches everywhere by train or ferry. In Vienna, he poses with his big fan Arnold Schwarzenegger. In another photo, she is embraced by Al Gore, a true climate pioneer, as the caption says. Hundreds of likes are also collected by Greta's photos with her two labradors. Many entries show that despite the strike, the teenager is studying diligently. When on Friday, May 17, she appears in front of the parliament only in the afternoon, she informs under the photo that she had a test at school that day.
25108	49	Greta's goal is to implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement on climate protection from 2015. To ensure this, the young activist and her father go by train to the December COP24 climate summit in Katowice. Greta was invited by UN Secretary General António Guterres. On social media profiles, the teenager posts a photo of herself against the background of the conference logo and a video of her own speech.
25108	51	"In Sweden, on the other hand, more students join Greta's Friday actions in front of the parliament, but it is difficult to talk about mass truancy. Entire classes are attended by teachers. In the following weeks, representatives of other professions join as part of solidarity. In Stockholm, under the parliament there are slogans: ""musicians for the future"", ""priests for the future"" or ""designers for the future"". Many people come with their own sign just for a moment to take a selfie."
25108	53	The frequency varies. On some Fridays, literally a handful of people go on strike.
25108	55	Despite this, the protest is growing in the world of social media, with the hashtags #ClimateStrike and #FridaysForFuture integrating demonstrators.
25108	57	POLITICIANS
25108	59	"Meanwhile, Greta, when she's not on strike, visits the World Economic Forum in Davos, pointing out to the billionaires that they flew there on private jets. He goes to the Vatican, where he meets with Pope Francis. He speaks in the European Parliament and in the British Parliament. Her activity is noticed. A young activist is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (submitted, among others, by Norwegian parliamentarians), and the ""Time"" weekly puts her on the list of the most influential teenagers in the world."
25108	61	The Fridays For Future movement has the ambition to combine all the actions organized in the world on the model of Greta's actions. At FridaysForFuture.org you can submit your own manifestation, find out how to organize a protest and what slogans to write. Or read Greta's speeches. The latest tally shows that on May 24, a million people from 131 countries and 1,851 cities participated in the protest. In Poland, the manifestation is known as the Youth Climate Strike. Every few months there are global strikes, then the action is accompanied by marches and concerts. Recently, not accidentally, before the elections to the European Parliament.
25108	63	"The ""Greta effect"" - commentators agree on the results of these elections, in which the Green Party group achieved an unexpected success, winning by 40 percent. more seats (69) and significantly increasing its influence on EU climate policy decisions. As polls show, in Western and Northern Europe, mostly young people and women voted for the Greens. It is these groups that are particularly visible at the demonstrations organized on the model of Greta Thunberg."
25108	65	– Manifestations, photos with famous people, but also private photos with dogs. Her social media profiles contain everything that allows you to embark on a journey with her to save the Earth, analyzes Emanuel Karlsten, a well-known Swedish media analyst. According to the expert, Greta's strongest point is her controversial uncompromising nature. “Her attitude is interactive. Because it seems impossible to use only trains or not to take luggage with you, adds Karlsten.
25108	67	GRIND
25108	69	"Ingmar Rentzhog in an interview with ""Press"" does not hide that the goal of the We Don't Have Time foundation - like Greta - is to put pressure on politicians. However, the paths of the PR agent and the teenagers parted ways in February this year, when the newspaper ""Svenska Dagbladet"" published an article revealing that Rentzhog used a young activist to get 10 million crowns from investors to develop his business. In the prospectus, the name of Thunberg is mentioned as many as 11 times as a great asset of the company. Greta Thunberg from October last year. in fact, she became a youth advisor to the We Don't Have Time foundation, which is the main investor of the company of the same name."
25108	71	"""There was no conflict between us. Greta simply informed me that due to the development of her business, she had no time for us – Ingmar Rentzhog explains to me the end of cooperation. He explains that the prospectus is a legally required document, in which he could not hide his relationship with Greta, and she was not paid. – I neither created it, nor used it – the PR employee refutes the allegations."
25108	73	"In turn, Svante Thunberg in an interview with ""Svenska Dagbladet"" expressed regret that his daughter's name was used for commercial purposes. “We didn't know about it. The relationship between the foundation and the company should have been clearer to us,” said the father."
25108	75	"After the article was published, Greta Thunberg issued a lengthy statement written in English. The activist announced that she ""wanted to dispel rumors about herself and the school strike so that she could focus on her studies."" She explained that in May 2018 she was the winner of a competition organized by ""Svenska Dagbladet"" for the best article on climate protection. Interestingly, she claimed that after his appearance, she was contacted by, among others, environmental activist Bo Thorén, who was to propose several different actions. “I liked the idea of ​​a school strike. I tried to encourage others to protest, but no one was interested. (...) When I told my parents about my plans, they were not happy. They said if I was going to do it, I'd have to do it alone without their support,"" she wrote."
25108	77	"In addition, she explained that she started her strike in front of the parliament alone. ""The first thing I did was post about the strike on Twitter and Instagram, and it soon went viral,"" she said. According to her version, journalists quickly arrived on the spot, and one of the first people to arrive was the climate entrepreneur Ingmar Rentzhog. “I had never met him or talked to him before. Nobody is behind me. Except for myself,"" she said."
25108	79	"The activist also explained that her strike, which began in August 2018, was not intended to promote the book published by the family. ""This book was supposed to be released in May, but as a result of the conflict, the publication was delayed and the publisher changed,"" she explained, adding that any profits from the sale would go to environmental, animal protection and mental health organizations."
25108	81	SUPPORT
25108	83	"The book ""Scenes from the Heart"", published in Sweden by Polaris, quickly became a bestseller. The cover of the first issue featured the face of singer Malena Ernman, other family members were listed as contributors. In the second edition, instead of the mother, there is a picture of Greta sitting in front of the parliament. In the Danish edition (the book was published in nine countries), the name of Greta Thunberg was additionally distinguished, giving the impression that she was the only author."
25108	85	"After an article in ""Svenska Dagbladet"" revealing Greta's relationship with Ingmar Rentzhog, the Ernman-Thunberg family tries to avoid associations with the PR industry. She refused, among others acceptance of Greta and Fridays For Future Titan Award presented by the Swedish association of PR agencies and advertising offices Komm. Greta was recognized for ""innovative communication that inspired people"". In response to the family's refusal, Komm CEO David Orlic wrote in a letter to Greta: ""This resignation shows our industry what a new generation of citizens and consumers expects. We see you, hear you and admire you."""
25108	87	"Journalist Andreas Henriksson, a freelancer who first wrote about the relationship between the PR guru and the activist, believes that there is nothing wrong with using PR activities. “It is a modern way of shaping public opinion. I don't understand why Greta's family and Rentzhog tried to hide their cooperation. Perhaps because it is easier to 'sell' a movement that has grown from the bottom up?"" – he wondered in an interview with SVT television."
25108	89	So does Greta Thunberg not use the help of professionals at all? Not exactly. The teenager's contacts with the media are the responsibility of Helena Iles from the three-person Iles PR agency, which previously worked with the Polaris publishing house, SVT television and provided media support for the tour of Swedish stars.
25108	91	"– There is no PR campaign behind Greta. I work for charity – Helena Iles swears in an interview with ""Press"". At demonstrations, he instructs the teenager where to approach and how to pose for photos. David Fopp, a researcher at the University of Stockholm, who works with Greta and her father, also downplays his role. ""I'm kind of like a bodyguard,"" he tells me. However, his research shows that he deals with methods of directing work with children."
25108	93	Media analyst Emanuel Karlsten proves that Greta's message is consistent and shows the work of professionals. “Because it's hard to disagree with her that there's no point in going to school when the future of her generation is at stake. This statement is provocative and food for thought. It shows that we really can't wait any longer, says Karlsten.
25108	95	"My interlocutor calls the phenomenon of Friday strikes ""an unprecedented digital movement."" “But you have to see it as a social movement. A cynical strategy alone is not enough to be successful. Protests for the climate, like the labor or sobriety movements in the past, developed because their leaders identified the problem, proposed a solution and reached out to the people, he notes."
25108	97	FOUNDATION
25108	99	Ingmar Rentzhog successfully develops the We Don't Have Time platform. Available on the Internet and in the form of a mobile application, it allows the user to run a free promotional campaign for their content after getting the first hundred positive emoticons. After parting with Greta, We Don't Have Time financed m. printing of leaflets for the needs of Maja Rossen's campaign consisting in persuading 100,000 people to submit a declaration of resignation from air travel in 2020. This action is also promoted during school strikes in front of the parliament.
25108	101	Greta is 16 years old, she is a minor. In Sweden, the Fridays For Future movement has no legal status, it is only an informal network connecting associations and individuals. Administratively, it is supported by the non-governmental organizations Klimatsverige and Klimatriksdagen, operating in the same area, but without much success.
25108	103	"What will be the future of Greta and her Friday strike movement? – We are planning to establish a foundation, but everything will be decided by my daughter – says Svante Thunberg to ""Press""."
25108	105	For now, the teenager is going to stop studying for a year. In September, he is going to New York for the UN climate meeting, and in December to the COP25 summit in Santiago, Chile. He wants to make both trips without using the plane.
25108	107	On Monday, September 23, Greta Thunberg sharply criticized world leaders at the UN Climate Summit. - I shouldn't be here. I should be at school across the ocean. And yet you come to us young people for hope. how dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words. Her speech was quoted by the largest media in the world.
25109	1	We need drastic action because the world is on fire. Greta Thunberg's appeal
25109	3	"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg argued at a rally in Glasgow on Friday that ""immediate and drastic"" cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are needed to stop climate change as ""the world is literally on fire""."
25109	5	On Friday in Glasgow, where the UN climate conference COP26 is taking place, a march of young people demanding more decisive action in the fight against climate change took place. The march was organized by Fridays for Future Scotland, a group founded by young people inspired by the Thunberg school strikes, and was the largest COP26 demonstration to date; according to the British media, about 10,000 people took part in it. people.
25109	7	Leaders do nothing
25109	9	"- It's no secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve the crisis by the same methods that got us into it before. We need immediate drastic annual emissions cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen,"" Thunberg, 18, argued on a stage erected in Glasgow's George Square, the destination of the march."
25109	11	"SEE: Greta Thunberg criticizes the way of fighting the pandemic. ""Vaccine Nationalism"""
25109	13	- People in power can still live in their bubble filled with their fantasies, such as unlimited growth on a limited planet and technological solutions that will suddenly appear out of nowhere and just erase all these crises. And all this at a time when the world is literally on fire, on fire, and when people on the front lines continue to bear the brunt of the climate crisis, she said.
25109	15	"She described the UN Climate Summit as ""a two-week festival of the usual and blah blah blah"" to ""keep things the same"" and ""create loopholes to reap the benefits for themselves"". - Leaders do nothing. It seems that their main goal is to continue fighting for the status quo. We know our emperors are naked."
25109	17	Activist speeches
25109	19	Speeches about how climate change is already affecting their homelands were also delivered by activists from several other countries. One of the performers was Vanessa Nakate from Uganda. - Historically, Africa is responsible for only 3% of global emissions, yet Africans are feeling some of the most brutal impacts of the climate crisis. But while the global south is on the front lines of the climate crisis, it is not on the front pages of the world's headlines, she said.
25109	21	SEE: Greta Thunberg statue in front of the university. Opposing students
25109	23	Friday was the day of youth and NGOs at COP26, but the climate march took place regardless of this event. Its participants and young climate activists claim that their voice is not taken into account at all; evidence indicates that Thunberg was not invited to the conference and came to Glasgow as a private person.
25109	25	On Saturday, another climate march will take place in Glasgow - a much larger one, because tens of thousands of people are to take part in it, to whom Thunberg will speak again. At the same time, climate marches will take place in London, other British cities, as well as in about 200 cities around the world.
25109	27	The COP26 climate conference, which Thunberg recognized as a failure a few days ago, will last until next Friday, November 12.
2511	1	The war in Ukraine is a human drama and a threat to the environment.
2511	3	While undoubtedly the greatest drama of the war in Ukraine is the suffering of its inhabitants, experts warn that Russian aggression also carries serious environmental risks.
2511	5	More than 1,000 experts and humanitarian organizations dealing with the environment and international law have published an open letter in which they express solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The signatories of the letter also stressed their concern about the threat posed by the conflict to the environment of both Ukraine and Europe.
2511	7	Experts have noticed that as a result of Russian aggression against Ukraine, toxic materials are released into the air, soil and water, coming from ruined buildings, exploding pipelines or damaged sanitary systems as well as fuel and chemical storage sites.
2511	9	"""In armed conflicts, human suffering is so great that it sometimes seems inappropriate to think about environmental problems,"" said Carl Bruch, director of international programs at the Institute of Environmental Law and co-author of the letter. ""But the truth is that environmental impacts can affect livelihoods and public health, and kill people by spreading diseases that would not otherwise occur,"" added Bruch."
2511	11	The letter pointed out that the environmental impact of the war would certainly be long-lasting and difficult to repair.
2511	13	"“When we talk about hazardous material releases, they are often invisible to the naked eye. So exposure to non-combatants - children and innocent civilians - could last for years, if not decades,"" said Carroll Muffet, co-author of the letter and president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law."
2511	15	Early in the invasion of Ukraine, Russia attacked military facilities, including airfields and fuel and ammunition depots, sparking massive fires emitting heavy metals and other toxic materials.
2511	17	According to the UK-based non-profit Conflict and Environment Observatory (CEOBS), which monitors and publishes data on the environmental dimensions of warfare, fighting in Ukraine's UNESCO-protected Black Sea Biosphere Reserve has caused fires that can be seen from space. CEOBS also confirmed that the actions of the Russians proved their lack of concern for both the civilian population and the environment.
2511	19	As the signatories of the letter underlined, an attack on a country with 15 active nuclear facilities poses an additional risk of catastrophe. Although international law prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants and similarly dangerous facilities, the Russians launched an attack on the Zaporozhye power plant, which is the largest such facility in Europe, having previously undertaken military operations also in Chernobyl.
2511	21	"Citing warnings in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was described as a ""grim reminder of the vital importance and urgency of ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels."""
2511	23	"“Just as oil and gas fuel the climate crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how fossil fuels finance, incite and prolong conflicts around the world. Continued reliance on fossil fuels is as destabilizing to global peace as it is to global climate,"" said Carroll Muffet."
25110	1	In South Africa, the lights have already been turned off
25110	3	South Africa is experiencing a severe electricity crisis, and residents are being cut off from electricity. The situation repeats itself cyclically, but the problems are getting bigger and bigger. The state-owned operator has been underinvested since the dismantling of apartheid, and Eskom, under the new management, has not directed its profits either to investments or even to proper maintenance of the network.
25110	5	Now, as in 2019, power outages are multiplying across the country, several times a day. Plus, it's winter there. Each time the shutdowns last for several hours. Public company Eskom even warned that South Africans must prepare for at least ... 100 days of power outages in the coming months.
25110	7	"South Africa's energy sector is 80% dependent on coal, of which there is no shortage. However, most power plants are aging, decapitalising and have not been modernized due to ""endemic corruption"". The state-owned company has become a haven and source of funding for progressive politicians, which was especially visible during the presidency of Jacob Zuma in 2009-2018."
25110	9	In addition, the state-owned company is heavily indebted. All this means that today it is unable to meet the country's electricity needs. It also doesn't help that South Africa's energy sector has recently experienced major strikes by workers demanding wage increases and housing subsidies.
25110	11	The South African government recently got $7.7 billion in aid at the recent COP26 in Glasgow for the energy transition. There were supposed to be megawatts of wind and solar energy according to the government's plan adopted in 2015. Seven years later, these new energy sources are gone. Meanwhile, electricity demand in South Africa could triple by 2040. Socialism combined with Africanization always produces the same results.
25111	1	Jews are fleeing Russia in a hurry, fearing the Kremlin's plans
25111	3	With the war raging in Ukraine in its fifth month, and the crackdown on civil liberties in the country, Russian Jews fear they may soon be targeted by the Kremlin and are rushing to leave Russia, Politico describes, emphasizing that those who choose to remain in the country, they live in fear.
25111	5	"""We don't talk about politics in our community,"" said an anonymous Moscow rabbi. After the suppression of protests in 2011 related to Putin's re-election, the rabbi ordered that politics must stay outside his synagogue doors."
25111	7	Representatives of the Jewish community were more critical of Russia's invasion of Ukraine than, for example, the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Kirill, Politico commented on Monday.
25111	9	Berel Lazar, the chief rabbi of Russia, called for peace and offered to mediate in the conflict. Moscow's chief rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt fled the country two weeks after the start of the conflict due to pressure from Russian authorities to express support for the war. He now lives in exile in Israel and has announced that he has no plans to return to Russia.
25111	11	“According to the knowledge of researchers and interviewers, the life of Russian Jews has improved since the collapse of the USSR in 1991 (…). In the Levada Center study, 45 percent Of Russians said they had a positive attitude towards Jews in 2021, up from 22 percent in 2021. in 2010. Russians admitted that Jews are the minority with whom they feel most comfortable, but only 11 percent. said they would be willing to have a Jewish friend, an increase from 3% in 2010. in 2010.” – writes the portal.
25111	13	Ilya Yablokov, lecturer at the British University of Sheffield, a specialist in the study of disinformation and censorship, who dealt with, among others, anti-Semitism in Russia, said that anti-Jewish xenophobia could break out at any moment if the Kremlin wanted it.
25111	15	– In the 1980s and 1990s, the brutal anti-Semitism of politicians was a reaction to the social polarization of Russia. In the 21st century, there has been economic growth, so the level of anti-Semitism has decreased, Yablokov said.
25111	17	He added that the Kremlin now targets other minorities, and the West has become the number one bogeyman.
25111	19	According to estimates, approx. 165,000 Jews lived in Russia in 2019, making it the sixth largest Jewish community in the world outside of Israel at the time. In the first three months after the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, about 10,000 of them received Israeli citizenship.
25111	21	In response to the mass migration of Jews, Israel launched a special diaspora immigration program under which citizenship can be granted to people who can prove that their relatives are Jews up to the third generation. The waiting time at local consulates has been reduced from 9 months to several weeks. Tel Aviv also allowed refugees to apply for citizenship upon arrival in Israel.
25111	23	"Olga Bakushinskaya, a Russian journalist who moved to Israel in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea, opened a Facebook group to help new Russian arrivals integrate. She said the number of requests for help had ""exploded"" over the past few months, with more than 3,000 Russians (and Ukrainians) have joined the group since February."
25111	25	"While many Israelis welcomed new arrivals warmly, not everyone is friendly. Bakushinskaya said she helped Russians who had been received with distrust by older Israelis who emigrated from Russia in the 1990s and refer to the new immigrants as ""non-Jews."""
25112	1	And what would Oriana Fallaci say to all this now?
25112	3	The little Italian knew well whom she hated and spoke about it in a loud voice, which is why in those few countries where freedom of speech is still valued, her books are published in millions of copies, and in others they are completely silenced out of simple fear. The same fear that prevented the publication of a certain caricature, because there would be protests, and maybe something would blow up...
25112	5	Oriana Fallaci, who died in 2006, claimed that almost all of Europe is now ruled by a completely new religion whose god is political correctness. All those who do not recognize this god are automatically doomed to the stake. Also books. If a book by Fallaci were accidentally printed in a country ruled by fundamentalists of this religion, it should be burned immediately. Just such a modern totalitarianism in the skin of a democratic and progressive sheep... Such democracy, according to the writer, is no democracy at all.
25112	7	What kind of democracy is this that, instead of listening to citizens, silences them, turns them over to the enemy, exposes them to abuse and violence? What kind of democracy is this that favors theocracy, revives the notion of heresy, and sends its children to the stake? What kind of democracy is this where the minority counts more than the majority, and counts more than the majority and is blackmailed and greedy!? It's anti-democratic, I'm telling you. It's a lie, a lie. And what kind of freedom is this that forbids us to think, speak, go against the current, rebel, oppose those who invade us or force us to remain silent? What kind of freedom is this that makes citizens live in fear of being treated and even tried and convicted as criminals? What kind of freedom is this that wants to censor not only thoughts but also feelings, and thus indicate who I should love, whom I should hate...”
25112	9	Someone who hasn't read Fallaci's books simply doesn't know what world he lives in and probably never will. Maybe it's better for him, because he doesn't have to think for himself, he has on his plate the whole easy and accessible worldview explained by newspeak, which, contrary to Orwell's warnings, dominates today's language, although perhaps not in the way he predicted. Words such as progress, truth and democracy - in fact, a whole dictionary - do not mean the same today as they did before Orwell. Thanks to political correctness, the whole dictionary has taken on a whole new meaning...
25112	11	"Oriana Fallaci tried to describe the world using archaic, pre-orwellian, incorrect language, which causes a culture shock, and for many is completely incomprehensible or even disgusting. But, she wrote, it is now a fashion, or rather a madness, that in the name of ""justice"" abolishes normal words and calls street sweepers ""environmental workers"", janitors ""housekeepers"", school janitors ""non-teaching staff"", the blind ""visually impaired"" , the deaf ""audio-impaired"", the lame ""motor-impaired"", and homosexuality ""different"" ... Isn't that newspeak?"
25112	13	"Fallaci is criticized - by those who want to criticize her - for the lack of objectivity, for twisting the truth and spreading panic that we are dealing with the conquest of Europe, which we graciously, even masochistically, allow. The Italian writer, even if she only gave us her own, not always ""objective truth"", tried to reveal the backstage, force us to open our eyes wide and call things by their names. Once we open our eyes and recognize that she's right, we'll have to do something about it, react in some way, because acquiescence, according to her, equals collaboration. This requires some courage... She believed that there are moments in life ""when silence becomes a sin, and speaking becomes a command, a civic duty, a moral challenge, a categorical imperative from which there is no escape."""
25112	15	Left-leaning Europe is so dependent on oil supplies from the Middle East or today gas from Russia that it agrees to virtually anything. We supposedly owe this permission for expansion and all the propaganda associated with it not only to the left - fascist black, red, rainbow, but also to the Catholic Church, which with its naive ecumenism not only tolerates this situation, but also tries to build bridges between the two cultures.
25112	17	“And where, not yet satisfied with his apologies for the crusades, the pope continues to bless them. Once again, Holy Father: why don't you come to your senses? Why, in the name of the One God, don't you put your brothers inside the spacious Vatican? Provided, of course, that they don't shit in the Sistine Chapel, that they don't piss on Michelangelo's sculptures, that they don't contaminate Raphael's paintings.
25112	19	This liberal Holy Father was John Paul II.
25112	21	Of course, an anti-Muslim* trilogy written in this style must and does arouse objections, but also admiration for the courage to express one's views, so rare nowadays. The indignation of Muslims is completely understandable. They just live the way they think life should be lived. They follow, more or less, the guidelines from the Koran, and we have little influence on it, as it turns out ... Islamic fundamentalists, making noise around the world and planting bombs here and there, are harming ordinary Muslims themselves, according to the principle that each stick has two ends. One end of this stick is in Iraq today... In the West there are also political groups that want, at first, to tighten the immigration policy, limit the cultural and religious expansion of Muslims already residing in Europe, and then... Who knows? Turkey, which would like to join the European Union, is suffering from Islamic fundamentalism, but now has less and less chance. Who will dare to let a country with a majority of Muslim population into Europe, people who, thanks to a European passport, could settle anywhere in Europe and build mosques there?
25112	23	"Fallaci pointed out that Muslim communities in European countries do not intend to integrate with the societies of the countries of settlement, but want to create their own enclaves, which, in her opinion, are bridgeheads of expansion, a revenge for the Spanish Reconquista and the Battle of Vienna. When Muslims were looked at through the prism of ""Tales from a Thousand and One Nights"", through the prism of the mosque in Cordoba, through the prism of Turkish bazaars, they still had a chance to gain our sympathy. On the other hand, events such as September 11 or the Spanish and London attacks have worsened the media image of Muslims to such an extent that people are simply starting to fear them. They are increasingly regarded as incalculable fanatics rather than likeable descendants of Ali Baba. After all, the subsequent volumes of the anti-Islamic trilogy were the writer's reaction to subsequent attacks, starting from September 11 in New York. Each such event only lowers the limit of tolerance of Western societies to the idea of ​​building mosques in European capitals, to accepting more refugees from Iraq."
25112	25	"Fallaci wrote her trilogy in hysterical and not very elegant language. In fact, you don't need to write three books to express what she wanted to express. A sheet of typescript would suffice, and perhaps even one explicit curse or insult after each attack. Being a writer, and what is more, the feeling of being the conscience of Europe obliges. The result was three volumes on the same subject, which is why Muslims are disgusting and why they shouldn't be allowed into Europe. Sometimes you have to cause a scandal to be noticed, to better advertise your theses, to convince your views, a media scandal that corresponds to each attack ... The Italian simply responded with her bomb to the bombs of terrorists. Her rhetoric in some countries resulted in publishing success and hit ""under the roof"". Other countries, on the other hand, preferred not to expose themselves to the Islamic protests or even repression that affected Spain, England, France and to some extent Denmark after the publication of the Muhammad cartoons."
25112	27	Mediocrities devoid of intellect
25112	29	Muslims are one thing, and another, no less important, or maybe even more important, are the attitudes of European politicians who change their views like gloves, are, according to the writer, intellectually limited and ridiculous. But that's probably always been the case. Oriana counted on the fingers of one hand historical figures who really had something to say and influenced the course of history in a clearly positive way. The rest are contemptible people, cocks on the roof...
25112	31	One of the accusations against the author of the anti-Islamic trilogy was that, apart from verbalizing the problem, she did not propose any specific solutions on how to defend oneself. Well, that's actually a problem. The democratic and open societies of the West, bound by international agreements, must, whether they want to or not, accept refugees from regions threatened by war and political persecution. And it so happens that until recently these were mainly Muslim countries, which, if someone wanted to be malicious and took up this topic, create such a situation, such a threat to their own citizens, that it results in waves of immigrants in Europe... Democratic leaders of Europe they cannot say anything other than what the framework of political correctness envisages because they are afraid of losing votes. The question is whether correct rhetoric is just a smokescreen behind which reasonable people are hiding, trying to find a way out of the situation, or rather, as Fallaci claims, mediocrities devoid of intellect, and thus of any vision. If the advantage will be on the side of the latter, then we can pack... Only? Where are we supposed to run to?
25112	33	Is the influx of Muslims into Europe really a problem? According to Fallaci, if quantity turns into quality, then yes! We all also agree that the problem is definitely Islamic terrorism. On the other hand, blaming all Muslims for Islamic terrorism is the same mental construct as blaming all Catholics for the activities of the Inquisition. Imagining that all Arabs, Iranians or Turks are fanatical followers of Mohammed and follow the Koran literally is as simplistic as imagining that all Catholics wake up with the name of Christ on their lips and live according to the guidelines contained in the Bible. So the question is, is Islam really a threat to Europe, or does it just seem so to some people like Oriana Fallaci? And do we ourselves really mind the mosque in the city center, do we really have something against Islam, and if so, why? Have we been convinced by Fallaci, or do we prefer to continue reading One Thousand and One Nights?
25112	35	P.S
25112	37	Well, I wonder what Oriana Fallaci would have to say now? many would prefer not to hear it!

25113	1	"""LGBT Conservatism"", or how proponents of compromise made the gender revolution possible"
25113	3	"Can a ""gay"" be a conservative? Nominally yes. This is evidenced by factions of the so-called sexual minorities operating within parties considered conservative. It was ""conservative gays"" who contributed - for example in Great Britain and the United States - to the liberalization of the law and the dissemination of anti-LGBT culture. Why was this possible and how did it happen?"
25113	5	"Generally, the term ""LGBT conservatism"" is used in relation to the so-called lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with conservative political views. In the first period before Stonewall (riots in a New York gay bar caused in 1969 after police raids), the so-called LGBT conservatives adopted and promoted conservative ideas, including those critical of the homosexual subculture. They spoke out against shocking same-sex inclinations in the public space, against the depravity of the young generations, against the adoption of children by same-sex couples, not to mention equating such relationships with sacramental marriages. It was emphasized that homosexuality was rightly treated as a perversion - but harmless - and immoral behavior."
25113	7	"After the riots, the emphasis was on self-disclosure and the pursuit of affirmation of a promiscuous lifestyle in various configurations. The ""conservatism"" of homosexuals was expressed in their support for the idea of ​​a government with limited powers or for low taxes. However, the Sodomites advocated equalizing same-sex relationships with the institution of marriage, recognizing the ""homosexual family"", equality for all minorities, and positively presenting - even affirming - homosexual lifestyle confessions. More radical ""gay conservatives"" demanded the right of same-sex couples to adopt children."

25113	11	First, decriminalize homosexuality
25113	13	"If you look deeper, you can see that the change of views among conservatives proceeded with the spread of the Enlightenment heresies. First, the focus was on the decriminalization of homosexual acts. For example, in France in 1791, Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau proposed a new penal code, indicating that only ""true crimes"" should be banned, not ""false crimes created by superstition, feudalism, the tax system and [royal] despotism"" ""."
25113	15	"Therefore, the new penal code he proposed removed crimes ""caused by superstition"". There was no question of blasphemy, heresy, sacrilege, witchcraft, incest or homosexuality. The Napoleonic Penal Code issued in 1810 did not contain provisions on religious crimes, incest or homosexuality."
25113	17	"However, it was Portugal that turned out to be even more ""progressive"" and in 1852 legalized sodomite relations. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was prevented from approving homosexuality in 1870 only by fear of ""public opinion"", which at the time still considered homosexual relations not a ""vice"" but a crime. Hence, on May 15, 1871, paragraph 175 was passed throughout the German Empire, criminalizing homosexuality."
25113	19	The same was done in Great Britain in August 1885, under the Conservative Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, when the Labouchere Amendment was passed.
25113	21	However, in distant Argentina two years later, during the Conservative Republic, same-sex relations were legalized.
25113	23	Great Britain
25113	25	"In February 1954, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that the Conservative Party did not intend to relax the law against ""gays"". He suggested that media coverage of homosexual convictions be limited and that the police offer treatment to any man caught in criminal acts."
25113	27	"In 2007, Brian Coleman, a former gay Conservative MP and former mayor of Barnet, wrote in the New Statesman that in the mid-1950s the London police became aware that future Prime Minister Edward Heath had committed homosexual acts in public restrooms. She warned him to stop or it would hurt his career. Coleman claimed that homosexuals had ""led"" the Conservative Party for many years and were therefore particularly protected."
25113	29	Major changes in the Tory worldview occurred after the publication in 1957 of the Wolfenden Report on the legal position of homosexuals and prostitutes. The report ultimately urged the government to decriminalize homosexual acts between consenting adult males. It called for tougher penalties against sodomites and prostitutes who commit sexual acts in public (it was enough for one person to witness obscene acts).
25113	31	In May 1965, Arthur Gore, the leader of the Conservative Party, introduced a bill to the House of Lords to decriminalize same-sex sexual relations between men of the same sex in England and Wales. The bill passed the House of Lords in July 1965 and was brought to the House of Commons by a Conservative MP Humphrey Berkeley, a known homosexual. After Labor won the 1966 election and Berkeley lost his seat, Leo Abse of the victorious Labor Party took his place as sponsor of the bill.
25113	33	In 1967, when the law abolishing penalties for homosexual acts was passed, almost all Conservative Party MPs - including future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - voted for the new regulation. Eight years later, Peter Walter Campbell founded the first ever so-called conservative LGBT organization, the Conservative Gay Equality Group (CGHE).
25113	35	"If Coleman, a ""gay"" and former member of the Conservative Party, is to be believed, many sodomites were to join the British Conservative Party and actively work for the so-called gay rights under Margaret Thatcher. Why?"
25113	37	"The Iron Lady was said to attract gay men with ""pure elegance, feminine perfection, the perfect way of dressing, and a determination to change society, even though her government may even have had an anti-gay aura."" According to Coleman, there was nothing in Thatcher's personal attitude to indicate ""prejudice of any kind"". The Prime Minister had no problem appointing “gay” ministers, such as the Earl of Avon (son of former Prime Minister Anthony Eden). It was her government with Norman Fowler as health secretary that tackled the AIDS problem."
25113	39	"Coleman went so far as to write that ""there are many gay Tories who would like to sleep with David Cameron, but it is Lady Thatcher's portrait that hangs above their bed!"""
25113	41	Under the Iron Lady, a bill was passed in 1980 to legalize same-sex sexual relations in Scotland.
25113	43	"In 1991, the world's first ""conservative organization"" of sexual minorities, CGHE, was transformed into the Tory Campaign for Gay Equality (TORCHE). It operated until 2004. A few years later, the LGBTory group was formed, which actively participated in sodomite parades throughout the UK. Over time, LGBTory was renamed LGBT+ Conservatives, which now works to promote marriage ""equality"" for representatives of all ""sexual orientations""."
25113	45	In addition to the Tory party, of course, there is an official group working for claims of the LGBTQ lobby - the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which is considered to be conservative. Its deputy head was the sodomite Peter Whittle.
25113	47	"In the UK, it was the ""conservatives"" who de facto led to the decriminalization of homosexual acts. It was argued that it was only about ""common sense"" regulation of the legal situation of sodomites, who had so far been imprisoned for having sex with people of the same sex. Over time, the attitude of conservatives evolved in favor of affirming a promiscuous lifestyle. Traditional marriage and family were attacked, and so the essence of conservatism was denied."
25113	49	"On October 5, 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron stated at a party conference that he supports ""gay marriage"" not ""despite his conservatism"" but ""because he is a Conservative."" Cameron changed the meaning of this term by reinterpreting traditional values."
25113	51	"The phenomenon of the changing normativity of the British Conservatives (Tories) was noticed by Martin Monahan, the author of the scholarly article entitled: ""Tory-normativity"" and gay rights advocacy in the British Conservative Party since the 1950's. 50.""]. The text was published in ""The British Journal of Politics and International Relations"" in 2019. He proclaimed that opening up to ""gays"" resulted from adopting a ""pragmatic"" attitude and discreet approach, which over time gave way to celebration and affirmation."
25113	53	"Shortly after World War II, homosexuals associated with the Conservative Party introduced the issue of defending the so-called gay rights ""in a form acceptable to the party."" They were not intrusive and initially did not demand an affirmation of a promiscuous lifestyle. They first proposed the decriminalization of homosexual acts, citing ""common sense"" arguments."
25113	55	It was not the Liberal Labor Party, but the Conservatives who proposed the bill to decriminalize homosexual acts in 1966, and it was ultimately the Tory government that passed the bill legalizing so-called homosexual acts in 2013. same-sex marriages.
25113	57	Monahan, who is affiliated with Nottingham Trent University, stresses that sodomites within the party did not question conservative ideas, but expanded and distorted their understanding.
25113	59	"Although formally the rules remained the same, they were interpreted differently and served new purposes. As Tory MP and thinker Jesse Norman (2010) explained, ""in ethics, [conservatism] is not moralizing, it is practical."""
25113	61	"In the 1950s, when more than 1,000 sodomite offenders were in British prisons for sodomy, ""conservative"" proponents of decriminalizing homosexuality pointed out that what adult men did in private - with consent - could morally be considered ""their own business"" as long as they do not commit their acts in public. If they violated ""public decency, then legal intervention could be justified."""
25113	63	A concept was adopted according to which the foundations of good public order do not result from the law, but from individual responsibility, and that society serves as a morally disciplining force.
25113	65	"The ""gays"" associated with the Tories pointed out that the moral law must remain firm and damning, although the law enacted may change to remove ""impracticality"" on a given issue."
25113	67	Appeals were made to Christian compassion and a sense of justice for minorities. During the second reading of the bill decriminalizing homosexuality, former Conservative minister Richard Wood argued that the more behavior is tried to regulate, the less room there is for individual moral responsibility.
25113	69	Another argument was that homosexuality is not the main threat to the family, but adultery. Meanwhile, unfaithful spouses are not punished as severely as sodomites. Therefore, the decriminalization of male homosexuality was postulated.
25113	71	"In the years that followed, it was argued that gay people were ""conservative by nature."" Many of them are self-employed or have successful careers in business. Many people take on the burden of mortgage payments because they want to own a home, and all homosexuals ""have a vested interest in the well-being of the country."""
25113	73	"British nominal conservatives working for the claims of homosexuals were closer to libertarians and neoliberalism than to conservatism. Anyway, in the following years, demanding ""new rights"" for sexual minorities and ultimately not only acceptance, but affirmation of a promiscuous lifestyle, they argued that this was how they were fighting the state's interference in individual freedom."
25113	75	"Although Coleman spoke of many ""gays"" flocking to the Conservative Party under Thatcher, a group within the party also attacked it for not being liberal enough in the social sphere as opposed to the economic sphere."
25113	77	"In 1988, the ""Iron Lady"" government even introduced provisions in the Local Government Act prohibiting local governments from ""deliberately promoting homosexuality or publishing material with the intent to promote homosexuality"", from promoting teaching that depicts so-called same-sex family in a positive light, etc."
25113	79	"Then, however, the image of ""gays"" began to be created as exemplary citizens who contribute to the success of the state, do not pose a threat to the family, but can even be a ""source of its support""."
25113	81	"Since 2004, when Michael Howard allowed MPs to vote on civil unions according to their conscience, a rebuilding began within the Conservative Party: on the one hand, to preserve the neoliberal legacy of Thatcherism, and on the other, to separate from social conservatism. It was at this time that the so-called modernizers emerged and pushed the Tories onto the path of a progressive agenda. The main reformer turned out to be David Cameron promoting ""an inclusive approach to ethnic minorities, women and homosexuals""."
25113	83	"After all, it was through the Conservative Party that the same-sex marriage bill was introduced and passed. And the party's 2021 pamphlet said denying ""gays"" marriage and its benefits could be seen as ""unconservative."""
25113	85	Currently, the LGBT + Conservatives faction has been strengthened with more recent demands regarding minorities.
25113	87	"Thus, starting from ""practicality"" and ""discreetness"", British conservatives initiated a social revolution and introduced far-reaching social changes. Everything was possible thanks to allowing depraved subversives to work within the party, first initiating a debate within the party, and then coming up with bills fundamentally changing the position of sexual minorities in the state."
25113	89	"Stefan Porion in an analysis titled: ""Same-sex Marriage Implementations in 2013: Modernizing Cameron's Social Agenda in the Conservative Party since 2005."" wrote that ""the breakthrough initiated by David Cameron"" was possible thanks to the support of other groups and the determination of Cameron himself, who considered the issue of legalizing the so-called gay marriage to be crucial to turning the Tories into a modern party of ""liberal conservatism""."
25113	91	To transform the party, the new boss isolated opponents of the LGBT agenda, introduced strict party discipline, and engaged some to work in prominent positions, binding them with the discipline of collective responsibility. Some were isolated to the end, like Baroness Young, who died in September 2002. Since then, Tory opposition to the claims of the LGBT lobby in the House of Lords has been declining.
25113	93	"According to Philip Lynch, ""Cameron's strategy for Conservative renewal was largely based on the strategy employed by Tony Blair when he became leader of the Labor Party in 1994."
25113	95	In turn, Blair wrote in his memoirs that the Tories were influenced by the New Labor Party and his generation defined a new paradigm: what you do in your personal life is your choice, but what you do to others is not. Thus, a distinction was made between attitudes towards people (non-discriminatory on the basis of race, gender or sexuality) and attitudes towards the social order. In fact, British conservatism was dominated by liberal ideology.
25113	97	Over the ocean
25113	99	In the United States, so-called LGBT conservatism is characterized primarily by libertarianism on social issues and a focus on fiscal conservatism, a limited role for government.
25113	101	The Americans resisted the legal changes a little longer. Immediately after World War II, due to fears of communist infiltration of national security institutions, both conservative and liberal politicians sought to remove homosexuals from administrative and military positions. At the time, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ran the Sex Deviants program, forcing sodomites out of their prominent positions.
25113	103	Until the Stonewall Inn riots, the atmosphere was not conducive to changes in attitudes towards homosexuality, although of course there were demands for the assimilation of sexual minorities. The issue of their so-called rights was presented as a civil rights issue.
25113	105	A paradigm shift occurred in the late 1960s after the Stonewall Inn riots, when rivalry between supporters of the ideology of assimilation and liberation intensified within the LGBT movement.
25113	107	In 1972, the Gay Voter's League organization was formed from the dissolution of the San Francisco Gay Activists Alliance, which became involved in the campaign for the re-election of Republican President Richard Nixon. Finally, in 1978, within the Republican Party, the Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) faction was established, whose aim was to combat the California initiative of Briggs, prohibiting homosexuals from teaching in public schools. It was endorsed by then-governor Ronald Reagan.
25113	109	"Under Reagan's presidency, it is true that no regulations were introduced to advance the so-called gay rights forward, with the president himself criticizing the ""gay movement"" because he was not just demanding civil rights; but he wanted recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle that neither he nor American society could tolerate."
25113	111	"Changes in this matter began to take place under the presidency of another Republican - George H.W. Bush, who signed the Hate Crime Statistics Act on April 23, 1990. It was the first federal law to ""recognize and designate gays, lesbians, and bisexuals."""
25113	113	Again, as in Great Britain, legal changes regarding the recognition of sexual minorities' claims occurred in the US, not as a result of their introduction by a liberal party, but by a nominally conservative one.
25113	115	"On November 29, 1990, Bush signed the Immigration Act which removed the phrase ""sexual deviation"" from the INA so that sodomites could no longer be barred from entering the US."
25113	117	"Bush changed his rhetoric and said in a television interview that if he found out that his grandson was gay, he would ""love his child,"" but would tell him that homosexuality is not normal and discourage gay activism."
25113	119	"It wasn't until he lost the 1992 presidential primaries to more right-wing opponent Pat Buchanan that Bush made a right turn and publicly condemned same-sex ""marriage."""
25113	121	In 1994, George W. Bush, a candidate for governor of Texas, promised to veto any attempt to repeal Texas' sodomy laws, and in 1997, as governor, he signed legislation restricting the claims of sodomites.
25113	123	"During the 2000 campaign, the Republican president did not support a single piece of legislation regarding the so-called gay rights. However, in a presidential debate, he said he opposed same-sex ""marriage"" but supported states' rights on the issue. Governor Bush became the first Republican presidential candidate ever to meet publicly with ""gay"" Republicans in Austin, Texas. On August 4, 2000, he received the endorsement of the Log Cabin Republicans, the GOP's largest rainbow group."
25113	125	On June 27, 2002, the 43rd U.S. president signed a bill authorizing death benefits to be paid to partners of firefighters and police officers who die in the line of duty, extending federal death benefits to same-sex couples for the first time.
25113	127	"In 2013, former President George H.W. Bush was a witness at the same-sex ""wedding"" of Bonnie Clement and Helen Thorgalsen."
25113	129	"President Donald Trump was the first Republican candidate to openly praise sexual minorities and pledged to ""do everything in his power to protect LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of hateful foreign ideology."" This is how he referred to the shooting at a nightclub in Orlando in 2016."
25113	131	"Trump appointed two gay men to the country's justice system, although he revoked some Obama-era privileges and instructed embassies not to fly ""rainbow"" flags. He also appointed several sodomites to prominent positions. Among others, Richard Grenell for the seat of the United States Ambassador to Germany. He later promoted him to the position of Director of National Intelligence. Trump was the first Republican president to recognize June 2019 as LGBT Pride Month. He also announced that his administration's goal is to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide. Under Trump, the FDA allowed homosexuals to donate blood, etc. The 45th president, however, declared war on ""trans."""
25113	133	"There is currently a struggle in the US between ""their good conservative gays"" and the libertarians who demand the de facto sexualization of children. Ann Coulter, a former GOProud advisory board member and longtime supporter of ""LGBT conservatism,"" argues that ""gays need to be pro-life."" Some homosexuals in the Republican Party are therefore against abortion."
25113	135	More radical gay leaders complain about sodomites associated with the Republican Party that they have sold out and capitulated to the anti-gay agenda formulated and implemented by the religious right. The mere belief in the limited role of the government and low taxes cannot, in their opinion, justify abandonment of radical minority programs.
25113	137	"It turns out that Republican ""gays"" supported the Don't Say Gay Act, which Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law on March 28."
25113	139	"Radicals from the LGBTQ+ subculture regret that the so-called conservative homosexuals contribute to the spread of ""thinly veiled homophobia"" by preaching the fight against grooming, which is a kind of ""cover"" for homophobia, similar to QAnon for anti-Semitism. In the US, the battle between ""radical"" and ""conservative"" homosexuals is intensifying, and as Leatherwood puts it, there are ""normal, healthy gays"" and those who preach ""the left's agenda for the sexualization of children."""
25113	141	"""LGBT conservatism"" in Europe as a counterbalance to Islam"
25113	143	"Specific changes have also taken place in the conservative parties of other countries around the world. In Europe, for example in the Netherlands or Belgium, the inclusion of gender ideology in the program of parties bearing the name of conservative is associated with the fight against Islam. Accepting homosexuality means belonging to a ""liberal nation"". Jasbir Paur called the combination of liberal values ​​and ""mainstreaming"" of gay identity ""homonationalism."" All those who do not accept sexual deviations (it does not end with homosexuality) are not ""modern, civilized Europeans""."
25113	145	"In Sweden, the ""right-wing"" Sweden Democrats (SD) make it clear that children raised by same-sex couples should not be condemned, and that the real threat comes from immigrants and Muslims who do not accept ""liberal values"" such as tolerating homosexuality."
25113	147	The National Front in France has also changed its approach to gender ideology. In Germany, the evolution of the “conservative party” position took place in the 1990s, when both the CDU/CSU and the left-wing SPD (Social Democratic Party) moved towards the ideological center, which involved a loosening of Merkel's approach to moral issues. On the other hand, there has been room for more distinct groupings on both the right and left of the political scene.
25113	149	"The Bundestag approved the so-called same-sex marriage on June 30, 2017, and while around 75% of Conservative MPs voted against it, Conservative MPs operating in contested constituencies likely attracted left-wing voters by advocating ""same-sex marriage."""
25113	151	"Merkel's party somehow promoted sodomites, e.g. the former German foreign minister under Merkel, Guido Westerwelle, contributed to ""warming up"" and greater acceptance of homosexuality, e.g. by constantly taking your partner on official trips abroad. The current health minister, Jens Spahn, is also ""gay""."
25113	153	Acting within the so-called conservative parties, factions of “LGBT conservatives” contributed to a change in the interpretation of conservative values, which included the defense of morality from the very beginning. Today, conservative parties in name have been dominated by liberals and libertarians.
25113	155	The anti-Christian program they promote is not surprising. In the 19th century, the Catholic counter-revolutionary Juan Donoso Cortes predicted that when God's supremacy is denied, when God's Providence and the existence of sin are denied, a series of other errors will emerge that will infect the social and political realms, institutions, and the law.
25113	157	"The Spanish counter-revolutionary emphasized that the world is ruled by a ""man of sin"", who is even ""moral"", but ""upside down"". It has its warped decalogue, ""dogmas"", ""bible"", catalog of ""virtues"" and ""sins"", even ""inquisition"". More and more boldly, he demands their recognition and repentance for specifically understood misconduct. The phenomenon of “LGBT conservatism” is a concrete reflection of this way of thinking. Certainly nothing good can come of this."
25116	1	Grzegorz Braun: Stop the Ukrainization of Poland!
25116	3	"We may disagree with Grzegorz Braun on some issues, but he is the only politician in the Knessejm who draws attention to the absurd policy of Polin administrators towards ""refugees"" from Ukraine."
25116	5	"The MP presented the draft document ""Stop the Ukrainization of Poland"". He noted that this is the only ""program to stop the process of disintegration and decomposition, not only ethnic, but also political, and perhaps also territorial"" of the Polish state. – When it comes to aid, yes, let's save lives, but not the standard of living – said Braun, presenting the main assumptions of the document. In his opinion, two things are needed to solve the problem."
25116	7	"– First of all, it is necessary to definitely put a stop to this uncontrolled process, which has not been controlled by the Border Service since the first days, of letting in unknown and undefined as to status and goals, coming to Poland from Ukraine. The second thing is that we need dedicated solutions, not drawing newcomers from Ukraine into the Polish social welfare system. But, horribly, some would like it to be a quick step to draw Ukrainians into the Polish legal and political system as voters. We strongly oppose this – emphasized Grzegorz Braun. According to the politician, the situation in this case is developing very quickly. He noted that although some time ago his group was criticized for referring to newcomers from Ukraine as ""displaced persons"", it is now used in the world of politics, including at the NATO summit in Madrid. Did the ""Russian once"" get there too?"
25116	9	"Helping real refugees, in accordance with international conventions, means saving their lives and providing them with shelter. In Polin, the Catholic principles of Ordo Caritatis were completely reversed. In the theory, temporary “refugees” are treated as full-fledged citizens of the Third Republic of Poland, although no military operations are taking place in the vast majority of Ukraine. The traitors in power have already announced the construction of ""cheap public housing"" for newcomers, although for years there have been none for the indigenous population. Poles cannot bear the greatest costs of imperial wars caused by rival powers. Poles and their needs are always to be in the first place. We did not get rid of the governors of Moscow so that the governors of Washington, Brussels, Tel Aviv or Kiev would now rule in Poland."

25117	3	In Abkhazia - a separatist pro-Russian republic that is formally part of Georgia - there has been an outbreak of social discontent. All because President Aslan Bzhanya announced the transfer of territory to Russia where Vladimir Putin's villa is to be erected.
25117	5	Abkhazia's independence was recognized by Moscow in 2008 after the so-called Five-Day War between Russia and Georgia. Formally, Abkhazia remains part of Georgia, but in fact it is a Russian protectorate, as is the so-called Tskhinvali region (South Ossetia).
25117	7	As for the post-Soviet area, Abkhazia is a fairly democratic quasi-state entity. Regular, relatively free presidential and parliamentary elections are held there. However, all political forces are more or less pro-Russian, which results from geopolitical conditions. Abkhazians treat Russia as a guarantor of their independence. They do not want to live together with Georgians in one state organism. In contrast to South Ossetia, whose authorities are seeking formal incorporation into the Russian Federation (a referendum on this issue was announced several times, but it did not take place due to Moscow's lack of interest), Abkhazia wants to remain as independent as possible.
25117	9	Paper independence
25117	10	However, this independence largely remains on paper. The economy of this small para-state is fully dependent on its northern neighbor. The Abkhazians mainly derive their income from the export of tangerines and the numerous arrivals of Russian tourists. In addition, Russian troops are stationed in the base in Gudauta in Abkhazia, and the borders are guarded by Russian border guards. Russians are also investing in the local infrastructure and tourism sector.
25117	12	Soviet resort
25117	13	Even in Soviet times, Abkhazia was very popular among the political elite of the empire as a holiday resort. Soviet Genseks used to come to it for rest. The most famous Abkhazian resorts included the capital Sukhumi, Picunda, Gagry and New Aton.
25117	15	After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Georgia's declaration of independence, a war broke out between Georgians and Abkhazians, which Sukhumi won with clear, if informal, support from Russia. However, the republic declined. The resorts often fell into disrepair.
25117	17	Abkhazians are well aware that they are dependent on the Russians. However, from time to time the local population opposes too much pro-Russian tendencies, which after some politicians.
25117	19	Abkhaz rebellion
25117	20	In recent days, the Abkhazians have protested against the idea of ​​de facto president Aslan Bzhanya, who had announced a few days earlier that he would transfer 184 hectares of forests and 115 hectares of water in the village of Picunda to Russia. These territories are located within the reserve area. The residence of President Vladimir Putin is to be built there.
25117	22	As a result of the protests, the Abkhazian parliament decided to postpone the decision to hand over the territory to Russia. President Bzhan explained that giving the area to the Russians resulted from the agreement concluded in 1995. Moreover, he emphasized that Vladimir Putin likes to visit the town, and Russia has much more funds to invest in the resort.
25117	24	We will not give up the land
25118	3	The value of new Chinese investments in Russia under the strategic Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) fell to zero in the first half of 2022; This is an unprecedented situation, demonstrating China's reluctance to bear the cost of the sanctions imposed on the Kremlin in response to its aggression against Ukraine, the Financial Times reported.
25118	5	"In the first six months of this year, Beijing did not conclude any agreement with Russian entities under the BRI. This is a complete novelty, not seen since the launch of the Chinese initiative nine years ago. In 2021, the value of Chinese-Russian contracts amounted to about $2 billion. — reported researchers from Fudan University in Shanghai, quoted by ""FT""."
25118	7	As highlighted in the report prepared by this university, after reducing its involvement in Russia, China expanded the scope of investments in the Middle East. In the first half of the year, the PRC concluded agreements with Saudi Arabia, amounting to approximately USD 5.5 billion. Last year, the Chinese authorities invested USD 10.5 billion. in construction projects in Iraq.
25118	9	"The strengthening of China's position in the Middle East comes after the United States formally ended its military mission in Iraq and withdrew from Afghanistan. US President Joe Biden traveled to Riyadh in July. There, he promised that he ""would not go away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran,"" the Financial Times reported."
25118	11	China is one of Russia's closest allies on the international stage and opposes Western sanctions imposed on the country in response to the Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine. Nevertheless, Beijing has not yet decided to provide Moscow with direct economic and military support.
25118	13	Multimodal (using rail and sea) China-Europe transport corridors have been developed since 2013 as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, also known as One Belt, One Road. It is not only an economic undertaking, but also a geopolitical one, directly supported by the Chinese authorities and aimed at strengthening Beijing's influence, e.g. in the countries of Central Asia and the South Caucasus.
25118	15	The most important transport route under this initiative has so far been the connection via Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Poland, which used, among others, reloading terminals in Małaszewicze and Sławków. In 2015, regular rail freight transport from Chinese Chengdu to Łódź was launched.
25118	17	In mid-April, Chinese media reported that a new multimodal connection to Mannheim in Germany bypassed Russia. The first transport of goods via the alternative route was carried out on April 13. The route starts in Xi'an in central China and continues through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Black Sea, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to Mannheim in western Germany. The length of the connection is about 11.3 thousand km. km.
25119	1	"Anger against Germany is rising in Poland. ""Too Little, Too Late"""
25119	3	The idea of ​​compensating Eastern European countries for Soviet-made tanks transferred to Ukraine with modern German equipment did not work out and led to a sharp dispute with Poland.
25119	5	"The German daily ""Sueddeutsche Zeitung"" returns on Monday (July 25, 2022) to the dispute between Germany and Poland over the exchange of military equipment, the so-called Ringtausch. In exchange for Soviet-made T-72 tanks handed over to Ukraine after the outbreak of war, Poland and other Eastern European countries were to receive modern equipment from Germany."
25119	7	The proposal put forward at the end of April enjoyed the support of both the German government and the opposition, giving hope for quick help for Ukraine, recalls Mike Szymanski. Thanks to this, the Ukrainian armed forces had weapons that they know well and do not have to waste time on training. The German government promised to compensate partners for equipment losses.
25119	9	So much theory. The practice looks completely different in July: apart from declarations of intentions and numerous problems, the equipment exchange system did not bring much, and there was even a sharp dispute with Poland, writes the author.
25119	11	"German proposals: ""too little, too late"""
25119	13	Szymanski recalls that Poland gave Ukraine more than 200 Soviet-made tanks. The German side offered Poland 20 older tank models - Leopard 2A4. According to the Polish Ministry of Defence, German tanks would only be operational in 12 months.
25119	15	"Too little, too late - said the head of the Ministry of Defense Mariusz Błaszczak. In his opinion, Poland needs 44 tanks. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk even spoke of ""deliberately misleading"" the Polish side."
25119	17	"There is also dissatisfaction in Slovenia. Initially, Germany planned to reinforce the Slovenian army with Marder and Fuchs armored vehicles withdrawn from the Bundeswehr, but the Slovenes considered this equipment obsolete. Slovenia demands more modern Boxer combat vehicles, Leopard 2 tanks and Puma armored personnel carriers. There is no progress in the negotiations – emphasizes ""SZ"". Talks are also underway with the Greek authorities, but also in this case there are no results yet."
25119	19	Why are conversations so hard? Szymanski wonders. In his opinion, the Bundeswehr itself needs modern equipment. At the end of the Cold War, Germany had over 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks. Currently, the Bundeswehr has only 225 machines. It was only after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 that Berlin began to modernize the equipment. Arms factories have now started handing over new models of Leopards gradually.
25119	21	Will the Bundeswehr run out of tanks?
25119	23	Every tank that is currently being handed over to other countries may soon be missing from the Bundeswehr,” explains Szymanski. The construction of a tank takes several years. One of the reasons is the shortage of parts, including cannon barrels. Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht promised that she would not allow the Bundeswehr to be further weakened.
25119	25	"According to the author, support for the replacement of equipment is dwindling in the government coalition. ""It's not working,"" said the chair of the parliamentary defense committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann (FDP). ""I doubt if this is the right way, although in individual cases an agreement seems possible,"" added the FDP MP."
2512	1	Between narrative and (dis)information: Serbian media coverage of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
2512	4	The subdued reactions of the Serbian authorities to the escalation of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, visible in recent weeks, show that the decision-makers in Belgrade are trying to maintain a neutral position towards the events in Eastern Europe. Public media in Serbia report on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in a similar way. In turn, the information message presented by Serbian tabloids remains clearly selective and more or less pro-Russian. Interpretations and narratives of the current war that are favorable to Russia mean that the content presented in the mass media in Serbia is at least partially different from what is published by the media of most European countries, which openly point to the unprovoked, aggressive and illegal nature of Russia's actions against Ukraine.
2512	7	"Retracted and neutral position of the Serbian authorities towards the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Serbia's position on the Russian-Ukrainian war differs from that of the EU countries, which openly condemned Russia's actions and decided to introduce multidimensional sanctions against the Russian Federation. The reactions of the Serbian authorities to the escalation of the crisis and Russia's final aggression against Ukraine, visible in recent weeks, show that the authorities in Belgrade are trying to maintain a neutral position towards the events in the East and are striving to maintain good relations with both the attacked Ukraine and Russia, which is the obvious aggressor. This leads to the conclusion that the neutrality declared by Serbia is in practice ambiguous, has a pejorative connotation, and in some aspects means de facto symbolic and actual support for Russia (see ""IEŚ Commentaries"", No. 556)."
2512	10	Public media in Serbia: centered message. The Serbian policy of neutrality with regard to events in the East is reflected in the content of the information message presented by public broadcasters. This message can be considered descriptive, balanced, factual, more or less symmetrical and in a specific way neutral, i.e. presenting the positions of both sides, but devoid of an in-depth discourse on the obvious, unlawful nature of Russian aggression and war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
2512	13	This assessment is confirmed by the analysis of media content for the period from February 15 to March 6, 2022, prepared by the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media (Regulatorno telo za electronske medije, REM). It shows that the Russian-Ukrainian war is currently the most important topic presented on RTS 1. According to REM, the content presented by public broadcasters (RTS 1, RTS 2, RTV 1 and RTV 2) in the analyzed period - including information on the war in the East - were largely neutral (between 66.02% and 81.42% of the total media coverage was considered neutral)[1].
2512	16	Serbian tabloids: proudly sided with Russia. An analysis of the content of the Serbian media over the last three weeks shows that the popular private media (tabloids)[2], which shape the information message reaching many inhabitants of Serbia, present content that can be considered highly selective, conducive to Russian narratives, or openly pro-Russian[3].
2512	19	"Thus, when reporting on the events in Ukraine, Serbian tabloids often presented manipulated and untrue - and sometimes also obviously absurd - statements from the Russian side on: armed conflict provoked by NATO; the defensive nature of Russia's actions, drawn into the war by the West; the geopolitical context of events in the East; Russia's legitimate support for the threatened Donbas; the popularity of far-right and extremist attitudes on the Ukrainian side; persecution of Russians by the authorities in Kiev; biological weapons in Ukraine; ""barbaric behavior"" of the Ukrainian army, etc. Putin's statements questioning the statehood of Ukraine were also quoted. Many of these types of articles were in fact substantive and linguistic carbon copy (""neo-Nazis"", ""neo-fascists"", ""NATO threats"", ""warmongers' regime in Ukraine"", ""special military operation"") of the prepared information message offered by the Russian media. The actual or alleged military successes of the Russian army were also praised (“The Russians occupied Ukraine in one day”; “The Russians reached Kiev in one day!”; “The Russians broke through the front near Gorlovka, this is a key victory for Putin’s army?!”) . The “Informer” daily probably went the furthest, with the headline “Ukraine attacked Russia!” on the cover of February 22, 2022. The whole one-sided picture was complemented by carefully selected photos of President Putin, suggesting that he is a strong and prudent leader, effectively opposing the confrontational policy of the West[4]."
2512	22	"Although the popular Serbian media report on events in the East in a biased way, in fact – as Marija Vučić points out – they do so in a balanced manner and do not escalate the pro-Russian narrative excessively, and this self-limitation does not seem to be accidental (“in my opinion, the tabloids but they are still chained in. I know very well what the tabloids' message can look like...when they have no self-control...These texts are somewhat polished, but they certainly don't meet journalistic standards."" )[5]. However, Serbian tabloids clearly avoid publishing information on the defeats and losses of the Russian army and war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine."
2512	25	Two-track information policy per facta concludentia. A characteristic element of the Serbian media space is also the inconsistent – ​​and in the opinion of Željko Bodrožić de facto schizophrenic – information message[6]. On the one hand, in the Serbian media, the narration of the authorities in Belgrade is withdrawn and neutral in principle, which mutatis mutandis reflects the pro-Western and European vector in Serbia's foreign policy. This narrative at least partly corresponds to the expectations of the anti-war coalition of Western countries, who expect that Serbia, which is a candidate for EU accession, will present a position consistent with that of EU countries on key international issues.
2512	28	On the other hand, the pro-government tabloids, which, according to critics, publish information that meets the current needs of Serbian decision-makers, present a narrative that is favorable for the Russian side, in line with the perspective of a large part of Serbian society and the expectations of politicians in the Kremlin. This is because, as Nemanja Rujević states, Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić is too experienced a politician to make elementary mistakes in foreign policy, and “[…] he leaves his enthusiasm for Russian military actions to the tabloids”[7].
2512	31	It also seems that the pro-Russian information message, 'controlled' by the authorities in Belgrade and promoted by some media, is in fact a media veil for Serbia's pragmatic and – toutes proportions gardées – pro-European policy. These authorities are certainly fully aware that the possible and irresponsible involvement of Serbia in the armed conflict triggered by the increasingly irrational actions of President Putin would have dire political and economic consequences for all Balkan states and would throw the Western Balkans back to the 1990s.
2512	34	Conclusions. An analysis of the content of the Serbian media allows us to conclude that due to the pro-Russian narratives present in the information space, the media message addressed to Serbian society is at least partially different from what can be seen in the press and television of most European countries[8].
2512	37	A characteristic element of the media coverage in Serbia is the two-track information policy, under which the Serbian president, aware of the existing international realities, officially indicates the need to maintain a neutral attitude towards the conflict in the East, and the pro-government Serbian tabloids are on the side of Russia's ally[9].
2512	40	The specificity of the Serbian media coverage is in fact well reflected in the statement of President Vučić himself, who on February 23, 2022 accused the media of - surprisingly - lack of objectivity, stating that regardless of the situation, 80% of the Serbian media will always be on the side of Russia, and 20% - by definition against. This statement was probably intended to soften the pro-Russian tone of the message, which is incomprehensible in international reception, presented by a large part of the Serbian media[10].
2512	43	There are also media outlets in Serbia that cover the conflict in the East in a manner similar to that of most European broadcasters (e.g. Danas daily and N1 television), but their influence is limited.
25120	1	A British journalist points to four scenarios for overthrowing Putin
25120	3	"The invasion of Ukraine showed the true face of Vladimir Putin and helped the West understand that we have long been at war with Russia, believes John Sweeney, a British investigative journalist and writer, author of the book ""Killer in the Kremlin"" published on Thursday. Possible scenarios for Putin's overthrow include: groups dissatisfied with the actions of the Russian president. It also evokes the stories of Tsar Nicholas II and Adolf Hitler."
25120	5	The fastest and best way to ensure the security of the West is to remove Putin from power, and this can be done by allowing Ukrainian troops to achieve a decisive victory, such that Russian troops will be pushed out of Ukraine and humiliated. And this will probably trigger a series of events similar to those that happened to Nicholas II, he argued.
25120	7	Four scenarios of overthrowing Putin
25120	9	Sweeney pointed out several possible scenarios for overthrowing Putin. The first is that it will be done by the oligarchs, who, he said, are furious with Putin for being ruined or half-ruined as a result of the sanctions.
25120	11	The second is that it will be done by the generals, those who have not yet died on the front, because they too are furious that they have been given a task - which, given the fortitude of the Ukrainians and the increasingly better equipment in their possession - is actually impossible to complete.
25120	13	The third is that Putin, who is suspected to be obsessed with his health and frequently undergoes surgeries, will not wake up from anesthesia after one of them.
25120	15	Finally, most likely, according to Sweeney, is that Putin, who ordered the poisoning of others for years, will eventually poison himself, like Adolf Hitler.
25120	17	I believe that if the Russian army is defeated, its commanders and key people in the power departments will turn against Putin. For this, it is necessary to send heavy equipment in the right quantities. Great Britain sends, but, for example, Italy, Germany or France do not do as much as they could. In turn, the US, as usual, enters the war late - let's remember how it was in 1917 and 1941 - but when they do, they do it well. HIMARS systems make a difference because they have a greater range than Russian systems, he noted.
25120	19	Putin's army is too small to conquer Ukraine
25120	21	Speaking of the impossible mission to conquer Ukraine, Sweeney recalled his own calculations, made long before the invasion, showing that it would take several times more troops than the Russian president threw at the country.
25120	23	It always takes more attacking forces to attack than defending - the ratio is usually 3:1. If it was 3:1, it means that since Ukraine had 200,000. soldiers, but also 100,000 policemen and armed officers of other services, Russia should have attacked with forces of 900,000. people. But taking into account the will to fight of Ukrainians who defend their homes, the ratio is actually 7:1. That means 2.1 million people would be needed, not the 200,000 that Putin actually sent. My calculations were good, Putin's and the CIA's were not, Sweeney stressed.
25120	25	He also added that the decision to give up the fight for Kyiv in the face of failure, leave the north of Ukraine and concentrate on the south-east was right from the military point of view and proves that Putin understood his mistake and, despite some isolation from the world, in where he has been since the COVID-19 pandemic - remains a rational actor.
25120	27	"A British journalist cited the opinion of Semyon Gluzman, a Ukrainian psychiatrist who was the first to publicly oppose the use of psychiatry to persecute dissidents during the Soviet era, that Putin is ""bad, not mad."" ""That's kind of good news because he won't use nuclear weapons. He knows that if he did, it would be the end of Russia,"" Sweeney said."
25120	29	Building Russia after Putin will be very difficult
25120	31	"Speaking about the future of Russia, he emphasized that one cannot look at it only through Putin's prism. ""I do not agree that there is no other Russia than Putin. There is the Russia of Natalia (Estemirova), Boris (Nemtsov), Alexei (Navalny). The problem is that this other Russia is poisoned, shot at, imprisoned. what we can hope for is that the pressure on Vladimir Putin will be so great that it will become overwhelming and then a new Russia will be created. And the plea to my Russian friends is - don't screw it up,"" Sweeney urged. However, he admitted that building this new Russia will be a very difficult challenge."
25122	3	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has divided the Russian entertainment sector. Some artists supported the actions of the Kremlin, others more or less openly criticized. However, the Ukrainian media mainly point to the silence of the satirical and cabaret industry, which is close to President Zelensky.
25122	5	One of the most commented topics in Russian show business in recent months has been the emigration of the famous Alla Pugacheva. The great star of the Russian stage is today critical of the ruling regime, but according to the media, her decision to leave the country was dictated primarily by fears about the consequences of the anti-government statements of her husband, comedian Maksim Galkin, 27 years his junior. The couple, together with their two children, almost ten-year-old twins, decided to flee to Israel.
25122	7	"Galkin is not the only Russian satirist to openly oppose the war. In a letter published by the independent Russian portal Meduza, 260 Russian or Russian comedians appealed to Vladimir Putin to ""stop military operations on Ukrainian territory and settle differences of opinion through negotiations."""
25122	9	"""Zelensky's industry"" is silent"
25122	11	"However, the examples of Galkin or the signatories of the letter to Putin are still a minority in the satirical industry. Most satirists avoid talking about war. Voices of support are not heard even from the circles associated with the formerly Soviet, and today popular in almost all countries of the former USSR cabaret league ""KVN"" (Russian abbreviation for ""Club of cheerful and inventive""), where the current president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky began his career and where until 2014 cabaret teams from Ukraine performed in large numbers and were even successful."
25122	13	In April, an associate of Alexei Navalny, Lyubov Sobol, in a recording posted on YouTube, criticized comedians from the most popular Russian entertainment channel TNT, most of whom, like Zelensky, come from KVN.
25122	15	"The ""black sheep"" for the Ukrainians has become especially the Kazakh comedian Nurlan Saburov, who performs mainly in Russia, and who works with TNT. During spring performances in the US, when asked to comment on the ongoing war in Ukraine, he refused to take an unequivocal position. ""I have my fears too. I have a family and kids, you should understand that,"" he said from the stage."
25122	17	The straw that broke the cup, however, was an awkward joke that he allowed himself during one of the performances. When an activist dressed in a dress stained with red paint, symbolizing the blood of Ukrainians, ran onto the stage, Saburov, wanting to calm down the situation, asked if it was menstruation. The Ukrainian media then accused him not only of rudeness and ignorance, but above all of cowardice.
25122	19	"Unequivocal criticism of the Putin regime is also hard to find in most satirical programmes. While poking fun at Russia's shortcomings, Odnazhdy w Rossii (Russian: ""Once Upon a Time in Russia""), produced by TNT, contains irony about recent events (for example, a song about how Russia copes with the lack of Western products caused by sanctions), but never exceeding certain limits."
25122	21	Ukrainian comedian: Russian artists 'hostage' to the FSB
25122	23	Many Ukrainian artists were deeply outraged by the silence of Russian satirists. The Ukrainian comedian Igor Łastochkin referred to the conduct of his colleagues with greater understanding, although still critical.
25122	25	"A good friend of Volodymyr Zelensky, like him, started his career in KWN. He performed in Russia for quite a long time - including in the above-mentioned program - so he knows the local satirical and cabaret environment ""inside out""."
25122	27	"Lastotchkin revealed on an online show that after February 24, he talked to his old friends, Russian comedians from TNT, about the war. According to his words, most of them do not agree with Putin's actions. ""In the end, however, I was unable to convince them (to publicly speak out on this subject - ed.),"" admitted the comedian."
25122	29	"The reason for the silence of Russian artists is precisely the fear of the consequences of honesty, he believes. In his opinion, the Federal Security Service (FSB) treats artists in a sense as ""hostages"" who, in the event of opposition, will immediately be arrested, and then maybe even imprisoned."
25122	31	“Only they had a choice: to leave Russia. Then they would be able to speak normally and thus save face,” Lastochkin said with clear regret.
25122	33	Why don't Russian satirists talk about the war?
25122	35	"The only space where some of the satirists who avoid talking about the Russian invasion allow themselves to criticize it is social media. Most often, however, these are cautious and quite general declarations about ""supporting peace."""
25122	37	"“People are the most important. (…) In Ukraine, I have friends with whom I have many ties. I don't want them or their families or anyone to suffer. I'm for peace,"" wrote TNT's Russian-Kazakh comedian Azamat Musagaliyev, for example - probably Lastochkin, among others, was referring to comedians who refused to speak out strongly about Ukraine."
25122	39	"""It is hardly surprising that Russian artists do not speak out (about the war in Ukraine - ed.) in today's Russia, which is becoming a totalitarian state"", believes Dr. hab. Agnieszka Legucka from the Polish Institute of International Affairs."
25122	41	The EURACTIV.pl interlocutor points out that social media still provide some space for freedom of speech for critics of the regime. “Russian authorities do not control everything 100% yet, although they try to do so, e.g. by blocking Instagram or Twitter,” he emphasizes.
25122	43	"“Russian authorities have rather adopted the tactic of legal regulations. They amend the law so as to use the judiciary more effectively to prosecute specific people,” he explains. As he says, it is in a sense a ""return to the past"", to the Soviet times, where - if necessary - there will be a paragraph for every unfavorable person. For now, however, the authorities do not have the tools that would allow them to prosecute all critics of the Kremlin, the expert believes."
25122	45	So comedians realize that for now, they can afford some freedom on social media, but within certain limits, he points out.
25122	47	"""Freedom of speech in Russia will be increasingly restricted"""
25122	49	Agnieszka Legucka also points to a certain naivety of thinking of many Russian satirists, which may also be the reason for their reluctance to comment on the ongoing war in the neighboring country.
25122	51	"In her opinion, ""those artists who understand the situation have already left Russia."" On the other hand, those who still talk about Ukraine in social media, but avoid speaking about it ""offline"", ""still hope that it will all stop, that this ""special operation"" will end and maybe normality will return."""
25122	53	"In Legucka's opinion, this is ""a bit too optimistic"" thinking. “Freedom of speech in Russia will be increasingly restricted. Putin is increasingly afraid of losing power, and as the formula of the “external enemy” is exhausted, it will be necessary to look for an “internal enemy” – such as entities recognized today as “foreign agents” (Russian “inoagenty” – ed. )"", explain."
25122	55	“In the end, intellectuals, including comedians, will become such an enemy,” the PISM analyst expects.
25123	2	The military situation of Ukraine after nine weeks of war
25123	4	Despite the formal start of the second stage of the offensive against Ukraine - April 19 this year. – Russia failed to break through the Ukrainian defenses in the east of the country. Intense fighting is taking place there, but no significant change in the military situation should be expected in the near future. At the same time, the importance of supplying Ukraine not only with defensive weapons is growing, but also with other weapon systems: tanks, artillery and infantry fighting vehicles, which may allow it to maintain defensive lines and possible counterattacks. At the Rammstein conference on April 26, Western states agreed to increase and coordinate such support.
25123	6	Where are the most intense military operations taking place?
25123	8	The Russians are conducting an offensive towards the cities of Severodonetsk and Popasna in the Luhansk Oblast, and Slavyansk, Kurakhov, Avdiivka and Lyman in the Donetsk Oblast. Operations are underway in the Kharkiv region towards the city of Izium, Kharkiv is being shelled. Russia also intensified shelling in the Odessa and Kherson regions. Units of the 1st Panzer Army and the 20th All-Military Army of the Western Military District, as well as the 35th All-Military Army and the 68th Army Corps of the Eastern Military District are fighting in eastern Ukraine.
25123	10	Russia has intensified its offensive operations in recent days, but they are still not sufficient to take control of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in a short time. Although on April 21, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared that Mariupol was under complete Russian control, fighting continued in the city, mainly on the premises of the Azovstal plant. In Mariupol, the Russians use conventional bombs that increase civilian casualties. In addition, Russia has changed its tactics and has launched shelling of the railway infrastructure and other critical infrastructure facilities, including the military, throughout Ukraine, wanting, among other things, to block the supply of armaments to the fighting Ukrainian units.
25123	12	What is the situation of the defenders and what is the military support of Western countries?
25123	14	The Ukrainian General Staff reports that the forces operating in the Donbas stop several significant Russian attacks on a daily basis. Several brigades operate in eastern and southern Ukraine, mainly mechanized, armored and motorized infantry. The Ukrainians base their defense on m.in. on the boundaries of terrain (natural geographical obstacles), which increases its effectiveness. Intelligence information provided to Ukraine by NATO countries also plays a very important role.
25123	16	The Ukrainian side does not announce its own losses, however, taking into account the Russian data, it can be assumed that it will be forced to replenish the personnel of the fighting units and has significantly exhausted the potential of the equipment it had before the war. Thus, the importance of fast deliveries of weapons from Western countries, training of soldiers and treatment of the wounded is growing. On April 26, 40 countries debated at a conference in the American Rammstein base in Germany about the possibilities of helping Ukraine. After the conference, numerous assurances were made - mainly from NATO countries, but also from Australia, for example, about the transfer of advanced weapon systems to Ukraine. Germany declared to supply the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, and Great Britain - i.a. Starstreak anti-aircraft systems. Ukraine has already reached American 155 mm howitzers or Polish T-72 tanks. In addition, NATO countries train Ukrainian operators for the delivered weapons systems.
25123	18	What actions can Russia choose?
25123	20	In the coming days, an intensification of combat operations conducted by Russia, mainly in eastern Ukraine, can be expected. An important objective will be the actual takeover of Mariupol, which means an increase in the number of shellings on the Azovstal plant site. Only after capturing the entire city will Russia be able to redeploy some units to fight in the Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhia oblasts. It will also be important for the Russians to strengthen their positions in the Mikołajów, Zaporizhzhia and KrzywoIR directions. They will continue to strengthen their troops operating in the south-east and east of Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff indicates that the Russians have deployed two battalion tactical groups from the 76th Air Assault Division to the Belgorod Oblast, which borders Ukraine. Taking into account the increased activity of the Black Sea Fleet, we can also expect further attacks on the cities of the Black Sea coast, but also on critical infrastructure located in the west of Ukraine. The activity of the Russian air force will also increase.
25123	22	What can you expect in the coming days?
25123	24	"Considering the importance of May 9, when Victory Day is celebrated in Russia, one should expect an intensification of Russian propaganda activities aimed at its own society, showing the legitimacy of the fighting in Ukraine and pointing to the ""criminal plans"" of the Ukrainian side supported by NATO countries. It is also possible that the Russian secret services will act in Russia, such as arson or planting explosives, regardless of the activities carried out by the Ukrainian side in the Russian regions bordering on Ukraine. Ukrainian subversives will be accused of this, which will increase the feeling of hatred towards Ukrainians."
25123	26	Further provocations, similar to the blowing up of two radio towers on 26 April, may also take place in Transnistria. Given that without additional support for its armed forces stationed in the region, Russia will not be able to launch an offensive against Ukraine from there, these provocations will be aimed at influencing the so-called separatist authorities of Transnistria. Russia wants them to resign from their previous declarations of neutrality towards the war in Ukraine, and it also wants to create a psychological effect by showing Ukraine as an aggressive state that conducts sabotage activities not only in Russia.
25124	1	PUTIN IS LOOKING FOR TWO
25124	3	Taste of mustard on the bottom of the glass.
25124	5	If anywhere a glass festival can be celebrated, it is, of course, in Russia. However, it is not about the contents of the vessel, but about a specific model that fills the citizens of the Russian Federation with pride. These are the popular angular glasses available in IKEA stores. Many of you probably have one at home. The Russians may have a problem with this because IKEA has withdrawn from their country. Maybe they will, but not at an IKEA store. At least they know how to make them, and that's something. It may not be a technique comparable to the iPhone or other goods from the rotten West, but it satisfies the more basic needs of the average Russian than communing with tiktok perversions.
25124	7	There is no better time to tell the story of this glass than now, after the victory over Sweden and during the Russian aggression in Ukraine.
25124	9	four-sided
25124	11	Glasses are popular because they are cheap and practical. A large part of them is produced in Russian factories, and local trackers of curiosities and the influence of Russian alcohol and technical thought on the history of the world claim that it was invented in Russia. He celebrates his birthday on September 11, but (probably, because nothing is known about them lately) it has nothing to do with a terrorist attack. There is no doubt that many a Russian muzyk, after drinking a few glasses, will sometimes swing at his wife...
25124	13	"""Granija stakan"", or ""a angular glass"", was supposed to appear in the world in the 17th century, during the reign of Tsar Peter I. He wanted the officers of the fleet to drink wine in the Western way, from glass, and not from wooden vessels like some wilderness. At that time, glass was not as common and cheap a material as it is today, so it was necessary to think about how to avoid losses. One that it's expensive, and two that broken glass is a risk of injury. Same problems, but the drive to Western civilization was stronger."
25124	15	"The specific shape of the glass was to facilitate sipping on board the ship, because when it fell, it did not roll on tables and the floor like its round counterparts. It also lay better in the hand when the boat was tossed by the waves, and the company did not necessarily maintain full psychomotor efficiency. A historical anecdote claims that the glassmaker Efrem Smolin from Vladimir, who was supposed to present this unbreakable alternative to the ruler, is the first manufacturer of the glass. Peter I was supposed to throw ""stakanu being"" at the sight of the invention, thus signaling his approval. However, the tsar's entourage heard the ""beat"" and broke the glasses for good luck. This is how the prototype of the unbreakable glass began its career smashed to smithereens."
25124	17	She broke us
25124	19	"The real and documented career of the square glass began in the times of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But even here there is no shortage of legends and conjectures. According to popular belief, the author of the design of the glass in the shape known to this day was Wiera Muchina - a sculptor with many socialist realist works to her credit. The most recognizable is ""Worker and kolkhoz woman"" - a monumental sculpture depicting a couple of Soviet people with a hammer and sickle in their hands - a symbol of the Mosfilm film studio. The artist designing the glass was supposedly inspired - in addition to the spirit of practicality - by ancient Greek columns. The painter Kazimierz Malewicz, the author of the famous ""Black square on a white background"", was also supposed to participate in the creation process."
25124	21	In fact, little is known about the real creators of the project. Throwing big names adds glamor to the glass, but it probably has a rather loose connection with reality. Although nothing can be ruled out: many artists work off-kilter to have something to eat, and when the motherland calls and pays ... Especially when it is the Soviet fatherland. Muchina designed a beer mug, so why should she refuse to participate in the work on a glass useful for vodka? It's better to design a glass than to slide on a Siberian glass...
25125	1	MIZERY FROM VOLODIA
25125	3	Cucumber, cucumber, cucumber, white-red-navy blue has a suit.
25125	5	After the outbreak of war, the awakened Polish society decided to punish pro-Klemlin merchants and carry out a consumer boycott. Based on the monitoring of card payments in the stores of those brands and companies that remained in Russia, PKO BP stated that sales in them decreased. A consumer boycott, if applied en masse, can actually work. This shows the withdrawal of successive companies, frightened by the vision of losing too much of the income of large businesses from Russia. At least for a while or partially, as did Nestle - a company with as many as 2,000 on offer. various products that can be boycotted, including the legendary Winiary mayonnaise.
25125	7	Global village
25125	9	In the era of globalization, it might seem that only what you grow is truly ethical and above all suspicion. But even this statement, if you delve into it, may turn out to be false. The contemporary consumer is entangled in a tangled network of market connections. As a rule, he is unable to independently verify the source of the product, so he must trust the labels or the words of the seller. What more aware buyers buy from local producers, e.g. in markets. They prefer to pay more, but not to involve themselves in unethical practices, environmental destruction, climate warming or - what is now the time - war crimes.
25125	11	But evil does not sleep. While everyone focused on boycotting Auchan and Nestle, Putin's fifth column took a more Machiavellian form - the cucumber.
25125	13	Russian field
25125	15	According to the owners of the greenhouse, the practice has been going on for a long time and is not even afraid of war. Russian cucumbers are brought by trucks to Polish large enterprises, which pack them, label them and pass them on as their own, and more importantly for the consumer - ours. Polonized Russian cucumbers are sold to large supermarkets, but also to small greengrocers and entrepreneurs in market squares. So many are imported that there is no room for native vegetables. The situation is so serious that it is practically impossible to buy a Polish cucumber in Poland. Because all the fun is illegal
25125	17	Putin's cucumbers come to us by a roundabout route, mainly from Macedonia, with counterfeit papers.
25125	19	Earlier, they came from Lithuania and Latvia, but as it turned out, these countries are more civilized than the Fourth Republic - having learned about the case, they began to carry out inspections and the procedure was stopped.
25125	21	As indignant farmers, who prefer to remain anonymous out of fear of the cucumber mafia, say, a certain Silesian enterprise, which produces only a few cucumbers itself, supplies half of the country with them. Ukrainians are employed to pack the vegetables, they are delivered by Polish suppliers, and they are stored in cold stores built with EU funds for the development of Polish agriculture. The cut on Russian cucumbers is so big that you can earn from 80 to 100 thousand on one transport. zloty. Interestingly, Agrounia informed the Ministry of Agriculture about the situation, which probably said that if it pretends that there is no problem, it will magically disappear. I dare not even say that out of concern for the image, the government deliberately turns a blind eye to the illegal, extremely immoral and exhausting cucumber practice for Polish farmers, just to keep prices lower.
25126	1	THE REFLECT OF THE HEART, THE GLAM OF THE MIND
25126	3	For Ukraine to win, Putin should be damned. Poles do everything to make him laugh.
25126	5	“I am encouraged that the initiative that originated in Sandomierz was positively received in such cities as Warsaw, Kraków, Rzeszów, Białystok and Płock. I believe that the anthem of Ukraine will resound instead of bugle calls in other Polish cities,” the mayor of Sandomierz, Marcin Marzec, appealed to the citizens of the free world.
25126	7	"To make Putin's heels go away and ""as part of solidarity with Ukraine"", a Ukrainian flag was hung on the town hall in Jarocin."
25126	9	“I encourage libraries to join the 'Heart for Ukraine' campaign. It is enough to hang the hearts in a visible place (windows, doors, bookcases, at the counter, in reading rooms) and post photos of the blue and yellow hearts on Facebook with the hashtag #SolidarnizUkrainą. Let's create a photo gallery »Hearts for Ukraine« together” – the library in Międzychód added a pebble to the victory over the aggressor.
25126	11	The Warsaw Beer Festival also resisted the Russian military. “During this difficult time, what is needed above all is help for Ukrainians. I have no words, but no hope. The craft beer community quickly responded to the current situation by creating specialty beers.
25126	13	Since the entire Polish nation is fighting against Russian imperialism, tattoo artists could not be missing from this fight. Wrocław-based Chimera Tattoo donated all the money earned by tattooing each Ukrainian flag to help Ukraine. Jack Galan Art Studio from Szczecin - the same thing: income from tattoos with a yellow-blue heart symbol was donated to a collection. The minimum cost of a tattoo is PLN 100. The modesty of the tattoo artists did not allow them to say how many Ukrainian tattoos were made during several days of the action.
25126	15	"On the Internet, the fight against Putin is in full swing. ""Russia's illegal and unprovoked military actions in Ukraine"" is forcing Internet users to boycott Russian products. To do this, social networks tell you to read the numbers on the barcode. If the first 3 digits are in the range 460-469, it means that the item was manufactured in the Russian Federation and cannot be purchased. Unless the Russian company operates in another country. Then it will have completely different numbers, but you can't buy it either. Petrol from Orlen, produced from Russian oil, is of course a thoroughly Polish product."
25126	17	"More advanced Internet users rushed to spread anti-Russian hacker cyberterrorism. However, the attacks, data leaks and the security breaches themselves did not hurt the Russian companies, but the intelligence services of various countries that had been spying on these databases for a long time. That's why there are appeals to well-intentioned hackers not to get screwed, because the hacks make the entire CIA and Mossad intelligence work go to hell. Hence, the following appeals appeared on websites for Polish network hackers: ""By rummaging through critical systems, you can disturb someone who already lives there and can achieve a much greater effect than what you planned. Ukraine undoubtedly receives valuable intelligence from NATO countries, and much of it probably comes from the cyber world. Don't mess it up."""
25126	19	Other non-hacker Polish internet scramblers thought they would do Putin a disservice by slowing down Russian networks. They slowed down, but not those officially censored by the Kremlin, but those used by Russian Internet users who wanted to know more than that the Russian military bravely beats the Nazis from Ukraine who kill their own civilians.
25129	1	Tension on Kosovo-Serbia border. Ethnic Serb protest. Two border crossings were closed
25129	3	On Sunday, July 31, Kosovo authorities closed two border crossings with Serbia. The decision came after ethnic Serbs living in northern Kosovo blocked roads and fired shots at the police. They protested against the order to replace Serbian car license plates with Kosovar ones.
25129	5	Kosovo declared its independence 14 years ago. Some 50,000 Serbs living in northern Kosovo still use license plates and documents issued by the Serbian authorities. They do not want to recognize Kosovo's state documents in this way.
25129	7	Kosovo. The authorities closed the border crossing with Serbia
25129	9	Earlier, the Kosovo authorities announced that starting from August 1, the Serbs have two months to exchange plates and documents. They also decided that, from that date, all Serbian citizens would have to obtain an additional document at the border allowing them to enter Kosovo. A similar rule is applied by the authorities in Belgrade towards citizens of Kosovo visiting Serbia.
25129	11	"On Sunday, July 31, Serb protesters blocked the roads leading to two border crossings with trucks filled with gravel and other heavy equipment, and erected barricades. Kosovo police said shots were fired ""at the police units, but luckily no one was injured""."
25129	13	Due to protests at the border, the authorities decided to close both border crossings - Jarinje and Bernjak.
25129	15	Kosovo and Serbia. After protests, authorities delay a plan to replace car license plates
25129	16	On the night of July 31/August 1, the authorities made a decision. The government in Pristina postponed for a month the implementation of a plan requiring ethnic Serbs living in northern Kosovo to change car license plates from Serbian to Kosovo within 60 days. The new date is September 1.
25129	18	"At the same time, the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti condemned the roadblocks in the north of the country and the ""shooting of the police by armed persons"". He blamed the Serbian authorities for the ""aggressive actions""."
25129	20	Serbia lost control of Kosovo after the 1999 NATO campaign. The state has refused to recognize the independence of its former province and has since declared independence in 2008. It also does not agree to the use of Kosovar registration plates on its territory.
25129	22	Tensions between the two countries are now at their worst in years. Serbia and Kosovo started a dialogue under the auspices of the European Union in 2013, but so far no meaningful agreement has been reached.
2513	1	What will happen if Poles still do not vaccinate? Dr. Afelt: We hurt ourselves at will
2513	3	The COVID-19 pandemic continues. Scientists advise to prepare for further variants of the coronavirus. They also remind us that vaccines are still the best weapon. Unfortunately, Poland is one of the least vaccinated EU countries. What's more, the desire to get vaccinated is rapidly declining. We are no longer afraid of the epidemic. How can this end? “We are doing ourselves a disservice,” says Dr. Aneta Afelt directly. And it's not just about health reasons.
2513	5	The crisis is not over until it ends everywhere
2513	7	"The pandemic-weary world has entered its third year of fighting the coronavirus. Experts warn: do not expect the Omicron to be the last variant we have to face. ""The crisis is not over until it is over everywhere,"" stresses The Economic Times. Specialists keep reminding us that vaccines are the best weapon against SARS-CoV-2 we have."
2513	9	"When we analyze the data on the vaccination of our society, it can be said that we simply do not use these weapons. Recently, Prof. Karolina Sieroń, head of the covid ward of the Ministry of Interior and Administration Hospital in Katowice. ""(...) In the case of COVID-19, we have the good of vaccines for free, and only 57 percent of the population have used them. Vaccines are not an experiment, they will not kill us, there are no chips in them; they are there to could live on,"" she said."
2513	11	Less than 58 percent vaccinated population is still not enough. This result is also one of the weakest in the EU/European Economic Area (map above).
2513	13	What's more, the daily number of vaccinations is falling, while among the unvaccinated the percentage of people who do not intend to receive immunization is increasing. According to the latest data from the research agency Inquiry, as many as 47 percent. respondents in this group declare that they will not be vaccinated. At the beginning of January it was 45 percent. More on this topic in the article: The desire to get vaccinated is rapidly decreasing. Poles are no longer afraid of the coronavirus.
2513	15	Are we really ready to risk our children's lives and health in Poland?
2513	17	It seems that in the public space, the subject of vaccinations has receded into the background. That we are more interested in loosening restrictions than protection against coronavirus. Meanwhile - let's repeat - taking the vaccine (preferably three doses) is still the most important thing we should take care of during a pandemic.
2513	19	- After all, there are still people among Poles who cannot be vaccinated, if only because of reduced immunity (e.g. people after transplants) or ongoing anti-cancer therapy. After all, there are children among us who are too young to benefit from the protection offered by the vaccine, emphasizes Dr. Aneta Afelt from the COVID-19 Team at the President of the Polish Academy of Sciences. – Let's pay attention to what is happening now: we have a wave of infections among children, and increasingly younger, and a wave of PIMS, which echoes the wave of infections with the Delta variant in autumn. Are we really ready to risk the life and health of our children in Poland and refuse to be vaccinated? the expert asks rhetorically.
2513	21	"Dr. Afelt points to a certain regularity visible in every epidemic - also SARS-CoV-2. - A new pathogen coming into play is ""successful"" in colonizing people either in a certain age group or in a group with a certain health condition. As a rule, children have a quite efficient immune system, so they are the last ""client"". Meanwhile, since autumn 2021, we have been observing more and more cases among the youngest. This means that the coronavirus has already ""reached"" for the latter element - he emphasizes."
2513	23	What will happen if Poles still do not get vaccinated against COVID-19?
2513	25	Dr. Aneta Afelt replies to this question: - The effects of this are already visible in the decision to shorten the quarantine. The number of people in quarantine has already reached such a level that there is a shortage of hands to work.
2513	27	"If so many Poles remain unvaccinated, if we continue to allow the population to become infected naturally (which also happens due to non-compliance with the rules of the sanitary regime), then we will simply have to deal with further waves of infections and further variants colonizing us freely . From a scientific point of view and taking into account the calculus of probabilities, I do not think that Omikron is the last variant that can ""mess up"" in the epidemic reality - the specialist estimates. – And here the question arises: are we as a society able to accept that every six months we will be excluded from the labor market for a few, even several weeks, because we have contracted the virus and as unvaccinated we experience the disease more severely? And if so, how should we think about the competitiveness of our economy in such a situation?"
2513	29	"Dr. Afelt points out that such epidemic ""events"" shorten the life expectancy of the population, but also the quality of life. – Complications of long covid will have health consequences. Moreover, they are already beginning to be visible, e.g. We live shorter lives as a society. In Poland, deaths that are clearly related to the ongoing epidemic (regardless of whether the direct cause is SARS-CoV-2 or lack of access to medical assistance) start from the age of 35. Statistically, our 15+ population has at least one chronic disease starting at age 35."
2513	31	From the point of view of public health, we are a sick society and vulnerable to situations such as the current epidemic. Simply put, we do ourselves a disservice, and what's more, it happens at our own request, says Dr. Afelt.

25131	3	The summer wave of coronavirus in Poland began in mid-July, when the number of infections began to approach dangerously close to 3,000. cases. Another record of infections was broken last Tuesday, July 26, when the Ministry of Health indicated over 5,000. infections, and on the following days of the week there were an average of approx. 3.5 thousand. cases of COVID-19. We already know what the report for Saturday, July 30 looks like and how many people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past 24 hours.

25132	1	Coronavirus. In Wuhan, lockdown for millions of citizens again. Four cases of infection have been detected
25132	3	"China still does not abandon the ""zero COVID"" policy adopted by the party. Almost a million inhabitants of the suburbs of Wuhan have been put under lockdown again. All thanks to four people who have been diagnosed with coronavirus infection."
25132	5	Wuhan, from which - according to the researchers' findings - the coronavirus pandemic began, has again been subject to a partial lockdown. All thanks to the detection of cases of asymptomatic coronavirus infection in four residents of the Jiangxia district, the BBC reports.
25132	7	China. Wuhan is under lockdown again. Four cases of coronavirus infection have been detected
25132	8	Two days ago in Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, regular tests showed two asymptomatic cases of coronavirus infection in residents of the Jiangxia district. Accordingly, the citizens of the district were ordered to stay in their homes or apartments for three consecutive days. During the verification of contacts of infected people, the authorities discovered two more cases of asymptomatic infections with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
25132	10	Wuhan became known around the world at the turn of 2019 and 2020 as the first place where scientists detected the new coronavirus, as well as the first city to be subjected to strict restrictions related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
25132	12	"China, pleased with the effects of these lockdowns, continues to follow a ""zero COVID"" strategy that includes mass testing as well as strict lockdown rules and locally imposed lockdowns. Thanks to this, this heavily populated country manages to keep the pandemic under control, and the number of infections and deaths is relatively low. However, this strategy has a negative impact on both the citizens themselves and the Chinese economy, which is burdened by frequent and long-term lockdowns."
25133	1	Joe Biden defeated the coronavirus. The US president has ended strict isolation and is returning to work
25133	3	The White House announced that 79-year-old US President Joe Biden has had almost no symptoms of COVID-19 and is returning to normal work today.
25133	5	In Joe Biden's daily health report, Presidential physician Kevin O'Connor said the American leader had completed a five-day course of the antiviral drug PAXLOVID, had no temperature and had been off fever medication for 36 hours.

25134	1	There is energy, there are penguins!
25134	3	The German town of Lübbenau is located about 90 kilometers south of Berlin and 75 kilometers from the Polish border. Its recent history is by no means a success story, and the town seems to accept that its best years are behind it. However, he does it in an interesting and impressive way, including the help of penguins.
25134	5	The town has nearly 16,000 inhabitants. inhabitants and belongs geographically to the Spreewald region. The name refers to the river Spree, which flows close to this town with its extensive canals. Once, in the GDR years, the energy industry and a large housing estate in the center near the station meant that in 1981 the number of inhabitants reached 22,000. After the collapse of the socialist state and the closure of most plants, the number of inhabitants steadily decreased and in 2021 it was only 15,200 people.
25134	7	The largest coal power plant in the world
25134	9	Lübbenau has a great history of coal-fired energy; in 1959, the largest coal-fired power plant in the world was built here. It had a capacity of 1.3 GW and employed 5,000 people. In the 1990s, after the systemic breakthrough, it was decided to close the power plant, which was considered unprofitable under capitalist conditions.
25134	11	Currently, the energy supply in Lübbenau is the responsibility of Stadt- und Überlandwerke GmbH Luckau-Lübbenau (Süll), whose main shareholders are the city of Lübbenau and the nearby municipalities. Energy is mainly produced in gas blocks. The Lübbenau CHP plant currently has two peak load boilers (20.5 MW each) and 2 cogeneration modules (1.2 and 0.8 MWel). The plant is supplied with natural gas of group H from its own high-pressure network.
25134	13	Süll has a medium-voltage transmission network through which electricity is distributed, and its own district heating network.
25134	15	"The area between the railway station and the residential area north of it is now the so-called ""energy field"", which was created in cooperation between the city of Lübbenau, the Swiss company Repower and the company Süll. It is a place accessible to everyone, where you can see the innovative wind turbines ""Windpillar"". With winds above 10 meters per second, the turbine is capable of producing 17,250 kWh per year. The German branch of the Repower company has been the operator of the nearby Kittlitz wind park since 2010, which was built on the site of the former opencast mine of the same name."

25134	19	Lübbenau attracts tourists with an incredible offer. It is a great pool complete with 31 penguins. Guests can watch birds through thick glass windows or take part in educational activities that end with petting and feeding the penguins. Even before the outbreak of the pandemic, the penguin pool was visited by over 5 million visitors.
25134	21	Originally, in 2007, Spreewaldwelten GmbH took over two municipal swimming pools, which turned into today's water resort after many renovations. “Spreewaldwelten GmbH belongs to the city of Lübbennau and the local housing cooperative,” explains Ms. Sabine, who conducts educational classes with penguins. The housing cooperative, which owns over 4,100 apartments in Lübbenau and Altdöbern, confirmed in an interview with Biznesalert WIS that it is a shareholder of Spreewalswelten Gmbh.
25134	23	In the balance sheet report from 2019, Spreewaldwelten was listed as a particularly profitable company of this company, which, due to the high number of guests and the completion of the construction of the hotel, which is part of the complex with a swimming pool, positively surprised the parent company by generating profits. The profitability of the swimming pool and related restaurants and hotel was also confirmed in an interview with BiznesAlert.pl by the person conducting the educational classes. Spreewaldwelten is still profitable and self-financed, despite the fact that swimming pool water heating is extremely energy-intensive. In the case of penguin farming, there are also the costs of cooling food for these animals - frozen fish are stored in a large refrigerator.
25134	25	Neither the Spreewaldwelten GmbH nor the WiS housing association nor the local energy supplier Süll responded to the editor's question about the high energy costs.

For those who have already bought it, he advises not to use the car. Factory car defects are of course not a sensation, but we were interested in the reason for withdrawing the cars from sale. No chip glitches or software bugs. The scandal resulted from problems with the wheel bolts - they can fall off while driving. We do not know how the problem will be solved, but we are sure that the engineers responsible for the structure will have a screw tightened."

25136	14	The giant plane is not flying yet
25136	16	"The world media and social media widely comment on the film presenting the vision of a giant plane - a hotel of the future. The film was published by a Yemeni science communicator. The plane could take 5,000 guests on board, who would use swimming pools, supermarkets, cinemas and theatres. Powered by 20 engines, the air hotel would not have to land for several years, because the vision assumes that it would be powered by nuclear energy. We have doubts about the feasibility of this vision. All this news reminds us a bit of a text from an old satirical radio program of Trójka: ""News from the country: A group of engineers has constructed a one-wheeled car. The car is not running at the moment"""

25136	21	With ethics on the sidelines
25136	23	"This could be a strong candidate for the title of ""slip of the year"". One of the ""Big Four"" consulting companies is to pay in the US (as a result of a settlement) a penalty of USD 100 million. Why? It turned out that the company's employees - including candidates for auditors - cheated on exams (more precisely - they shared the keys to the answers with each other). Half the trouble that they downloaded. Worse, not very fair practices took place during exams in ... professional ethics. That is quite a desirable feature in independent auditors. Although, on the other hand, in times of rush for a career, nothing will surprise us. Unless it's cheating on the practical driving test."

25136	28	10 years and extra time
25136	30	There is no end in sight for the case of the Warsaw Investment Group, which has been dragging on for many years. The process, which involves causing losses of PLN 250 million (invested by nearly 1.2 thousand people), lasted over 10 years. It ended with the acquittal of the WGI chiefs in 2020. Now it will start anew, because the Court of Appeal overturned the verdict, the media inform. Although the case is not funny for either the accused or the injured, it is hard not to get the impression that the work of the justice system in this case resembles a Monty Python sketch with the Olympic finale of hide and seek. After the two players reached the same time - more than 11 years - in the search for a rival, the judges decided that it was a draw and called overtime.

25136	37	"UOKiK imposed fines (from several to several dozen thousand zlotys) on several well-known influencers for ""lack of cooperation with the office"". Let us explain that this is about proceedings conducted by UOKiK regarding, among others, correct marking of advertising content in materials posted on the Internet. According to UOKiK, the fined persons did not want to provide information or provide the requested documents. More interesting than the decision of UOKiK is the reaction of Internet users. Far from sympathy, shall we say. It is clear from the comments that an influencer in the eyes of Internet users is someone that no one likes, but everyone would like to become one."

Ten years ago in Warsaw, the price of a Big Mac was the equivalent of 36 minutes of work. As a result, Poland is among the eleven countries where the sandwich is the most expensive. How to deal with this yeast? As we know, the owner of Comarch provides excellent advice on the amount of meat consumed by less affluent Poles.

The government is considering a double increase in the minimum wage in 2023 - in January to PLN 3,350, and from July to PLN 3,500. We do not want to call the wolf out of the woods and remind you that in 2019 the ruling party announced an increase in the minimum wage by the end of 2023 to PLN 4,000. As you can see, the fight against inflation is in full swing.

It is worth recalling, however, that the main threads of the forum were supposed to be, among others: post-pandemic recovery and combating climate change. The approach of the participants, especially to the latter topic, aroused some controversy. Photos of cars standing in a huge traffic jam on their way to the Swiss resort appeared on the Internet. Passengers of these cars, after reaching their destination, probably discussed with great verve the issue of limiting the use of fossil fuels.

For example, it costs over 200,000 to refuel such an Airbus up to the cap. zlotys because the plane takes 23 thousand. liters of fuel.

25137	38	You can be late with many things, but giving flowers a few days, e.g. after an important jubilee, is a very hard and potentially unpleasant slip-up. Therefore, one of the flower delivery companies that came under the scrutiny of UOKiK cannot count on much sympathy. Her customers complained that she did not deliver flowers ordered for important holidays on time (or not at all). What's more, in the terms of sale, the company allegedly included a clause that in some situations relieves it of responsibility for failure to deliver flowers on time. UOKiK decided that this was not allowed. And rightly so. Giving flowers the day after the deadline is sometimes worse than not giving them at all.

25137	43	Polish expenditure on innovation would be enough for Samsung to buy cotton balls
25137	45	There is a lot of talk in Poland about the need to increase investment in innovation. In 2020, PLN 32 billion was spent on research and development in our country, and the announcements on this subject proudly emphasized that over ten years there had been a ten-fold increase in our country. Of course, let's enjoy such high dynamics, but information like the one announced by the Samsung Group affects us like a bucket of cold water. By 2026, it plans to increase investments in semiconductors and biotechnology to approximately USD 360 billion…

In addition, it was the vice-leader - after China - in the export of aluminum windows and doors with a share of 9.2 percent. and the third, after China and Brazil, exporter of wooden doors with a share of 8.3 percent.

The lieutenant colonel would also feel good on New Year's Eve (and the next few days) in Poland, where the smell of burnt fireworks lingers in the air for a long time after the annual fireworks display. A pandemic is not a pandemic – many Poles (apart from animal owners) love the New Year's Eve cannonade. This can also be seen in EU statistics. According to them, in 2019, 11,000 tonnes of fireworks were imported to Poland from outside the EU. The leader is Germany, which imported as much as 38,000 tons."

25138	14	It's not good
25138	16	"The Ministry of Finance has published on its website information on tax changes in 2021. As we know, apart from a few favorable ones, several new solutions have come into force this year, which - to put it mildly - are not business-friendly. The ministry's communications department is doing everything possible not to call things by their names. When writing about the CIT taxation of limited partnerships, he uses the expression ""tightening provisions"". And while informing about the introduction of the trade tax, he argues that this tax is not new at all, because it was introduced a few years ago, but its entry into force was only delayed. By the way - point. It's just that this verbal acrobatics, the aim of which is to avoid the expression ""new taxes"" at all costs, is a bit like the dilemmas of a certain manager of a community center from the times of the People's Republic of Poland. He was supposed to organize a concert of a punk band. Unfortunately, in accordance with the then punk style, the band had a vulgar name ""Prze .....e"". However, the clever manager managed to get out of this awkward situation and wrote on the poster that the band ""Not good"" will play."

25138	22	It's not just sugar that's bad for your health
25138	24	"""I do not see anything wrong in it. Sugar is unhealthy, so it should be subject to a higher tax, said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki when asked about the tax on certain sugar-containing products introduced in January. As we know, it caused soaring prices of sweetened beverages. Some producers are already trying to reduce the volume of bottles so that consumers are not so offended by higher prices on store shelves. Commentators emphasize that the Polish sugar tax is exceptionally high (the third highest in Europe, after Great Britain and Ireland) and that it has not contributed to reducing the problem of, for example, obesity in other countries. Following this lead, one should expect taxation of chips, luncheon meat, bread, coffee, margarine and many other products that are described in popular health guides as having an adverse effect on the body. Such ideas actually appeared a few years ago. The prime minister can only be reminded that, according to some, stress is the most unfavorable to health. And it can be caused by rising taxes and prices in stores. But how to tax it?"

25138	30	In the Official Journal of the EU, what you have to do today, do yesterday
25138	32	"""Procrastination is the result of a competition between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex"" - this is how the well-known feature of many people is put off, often until the last minute, in a scientific way. Some try to make fun of her by saying - what you have to do today, do the day after tomorrow - you will have two days off. But it's not always fun. This feature is particularly troublesome in the case of submitting bids in public tenders. Many contractors do it even a few minutes before the scheduled date, which is a cause of great stress. This time, it is not the late bidders but the procuring entities that have fallen into the trap of procrastination. All because of the changes in the Public Procurement Law introduced in the new year. According to Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, almost 300 large proceedings may be conducted unlawfully. Why? The contracting authorities, among whom there were probably many offices, who wanted to make it before the entry into force of the new regulations and carry out orders according to the existing rules, in some cases announced the procedures on 31 December. They rubbed their hands and went to New Year's Eve. The problem is - as the daily reports - that in the case of orders above the so-called EU thresholds - it is not the date of sending the notice to the Official Journal of the EU that is decisive, but the date of its publication. And this may take place a few days later. That's how it was this time. As a result, orders placed at the end of the new year were published in January and theoretically should be implemented according to the new regulations. This is a good lesson for those who think they can outsmart the system."

25138	38	The Polish Agency for Enterprise Development boasted about the activity of its helpline last year. In 2020, over 100,000 consultations were carried out via it (telephone, e-mail, chat). What were the consultations most often about? It is not entirely known. According to PARP information, the hotline was contacted by, among others, entrepreneurs who are looking for ways to finance their ideas. This is the bright side of the coin. It is known, however, that a large part of calls to PARP are requests for explanations of complicated mechanisms, e.g. settlement of grants under EU programs. We appreciate the effort and commitment of consultants servicing hotlines of state institutions such as PARP, ZUS or the National Revenue Administration. They have a really thankless job. But we would be more careful about boasting about the huge number of consultations we provide. Yes, a lot of valuable information is provided via the helpline, but its intensive work and often overloading also results - or perhaps primarily - from unclear regulations that need to be explained to hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs.

A well-known fast food company together with a manufacturer of PC cases has created a computer in the shape of a chicken bucket. The bucket-computer is equipped with a heating function. This allows you to enjoy a hot meal without having to go to the kitchen.

The article met with a lively reaction from Internet users. One of them writes about the situation in his favorite bakery: “Bread costs PLN 14.00, but it has been reduced even though the sellers say it is the same weight. Because I always take the same bag where the bread used to barely fit or even stick out of the bag, now the bread takes up half the bag.” The comment may be a hint for sellers not to reduce the size of the loaves because customers will quickly notice. One way is to give smaller bags - the loaves will seem bigger and bigger.

EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs left hundreds of workers in Sardinia, Italy, unemployed and unable to accept lavish tips. We are not surprised at all. A rich Russian - as the anecdote below proves - with his generosity can solve many local problems. Well: ""a rich Russian came to a small hotel, left 50 euros to the receptionist, stating that he would look around the facility and if he liked it, he would stay, and if not, he would take his money. While the guest was exploring the hotel, the receptionist took the 50 euros he had just received and ran to the baker to whom he owed exactly the same amount. The baker accepted the money, then quickly went to the miller, with whom he owed - also 50 euros. The miller was content to pocket the money, but then remembered that he owed the taxi driver €50. So he called him and returned the debt. The taxi driver took the money and hurried to the hotel - the same one that the rich Russian had just been looking at. At the hotel, the taxi driver met the receptionist and handed him the 50 euros he owed for a recent overnight stay at the hotel. The receptionist took the money - at that moment a rich Russian appeared, who took 50 euros out of his hand, saying that the hotel did not suit him and was taking his money. The Russian left the city and everyone was happy because thanks to him they paid off their debts.”"

But it's not that stupid, people will shout what they don't want, experts engaged by organizations will correct errors for free and then the right people will put it together (some heap for sure) and voilà!

25144	29	Well, as reported by TVP Info, bad things are happening in the Norwegian state, because petrol is 13 PLN / liter. I hope that a country where the average monthly earnings in 2022 is less than PLN 23,000 will manage it somehow. And we can always send Minister Sasin to their rescue.
25145	1	You won't touch Heaven in Rzeszów anymore
25145	3	Today we celebrate Children's Day - as everyone is someone's child, I wish everyone on this occasion all the best, fulfillment of dreams and that Putin will smash his stupid face. don't thank me.
25145	5	June 1 has always reminded me of real carefreeness, colors, fun and such a real childhood that everyone should experience. Of course, as teens get older, they begin to view it more as an opportunity to take a day off from school. Always something. Well, after school, it's time to study - and enter adult life.
25145	7	Concrete in children
25145	9	It so happens that a few days ago (very) solemnly, Minister Przemysław Czarnek cut the ribbon in front of the rebuilt building of the rectorate of the University of Rzeszów. As a graduate of this respectable university, I decided to go to this building and I must admit that it fits perfectly into what young Poles enter adult life in our country looks like.
25145	11	A gray concrete block, almost windowless, resembling a courthouse or a prison. Anyone who will study in such a place will feel the joy of living in Poland. When I studied at UR, I always felt that I was missing something - I thought it was the modern equipment of the classrooms and the normal hours of classes. I was wrong, it was the concrete on the main building.
25145	13	In order not to make it too concrete, it is worth mentioning that quite quickly a new tree appeared on the Rzeszów market. It may look quite modest - especially for a plant that costs tens of thousands of zlotys - but I guess they won't replant a tree in bloom. It will surely provide plenty of shade and entertainment next year.
25145	15	Where did those umbrellas go...
25145	17	Speaking of entertainment on our market - as a result of the nationwide CBSP action, some Go-Go clubs were closed, including Touch the Sky in Rzeszów. I could write something about irreparable loss (oh those “pink umbrellas”…) but nature hates a vacuum and someone will surely fill this hole.
25145	19	"On the other hand, no one is likely to fill the hole in our wallets that Tusk is drilling, constantly raising prices at gas stations. You can always go for a walk to relieve yourself, it will be cheaper. Just not in the mountains - recently on the German portal Zeit.de you could read an article entitled ""Rechte Wanderlust"" (""Wanderings of the Right""). In this article, he claims that if you like mountaineering, you are probably a fascist. One learns something every day."
25145	21	"And the person from whom each of us can learn something is Senator Stanisław Karczewski, who earns a modest 37,000 zlotys. PLN per month ""works for ideas, on Saturdays and Sundays"". A wonderful approach, worthy of imitation by our children. Another person whose words are worth knowing is Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin - also known as Polski Midas - in an interview with Polish Radio who assured ""there will be no shortage of coal. In the autumn, this coal for individual customers will certainly be available.” Well, now we know what to expect. And certainty about the future is very important when inflation hits 14% and starts to taste like fine wine."
25145	23	But it is also worth adding that despite minor difficulties in life in Poland, it is worse in the west, which is perfectly presented to us by TVP Info - for example, in France we have the highest inflation since 1985. Not enviable.
25145	25	Whole 5.2%. Indeed, unenviable.
25146	1	Prime Minister Morawiecki is as anti-Semitic as Ukrainians are Nazis
25146	3	"The peaceful French dog regained his ferocity and growled. No, by Putin, he can only squeak ingratiatingly around him. ""Mateusz Morawiecki is a far-right anti-Semite who excludes LGBT people,"" growled Emmanuel Macron in ""Le Parisien"". This caused a slight consternation of the Polish opposition, because Macron caricatured its most radical statements, because even she did not come up with the idea to accuse the prime minister of anti-Semitism. And most importantly: not now! But the growl of a French dog is a valuable event, because it shows what the whole campaign of nonsense about the dictatorship in Poland was. Yes, as Ambassador Mosbacher recently suggested: part of the same campaign as calling Ukrainians Nazis, writes Piotr Lisiewicz for the Niezalezna.pl portal."
25146	5	Have you been wondering in recent years why Poland is called a dictatorship, although the ruling party gets a mandate from Poles in the next elections? Why does someone rave about the lack of freedom of speech in Poland, although most of the media supports the opposition? Why are attempts to build a justice system that is not burdened with political judgments from the communist era, cover-ups and extremely pathological systems, negatively assessed by Poles, that someone dares to call a fight against the rule of law?
25146	7	"What was this nonsense for when it was calling white people black? Since most Poles were knocking on their heads while listening to them? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying. So that one day it would be possible to bomb Polish cities with impunity. Poland was made disgusting so that no one would want to defend it or help it. And if it fails to bomb, at least so that its position does not count after the attack on Ukraine. Because it was known that Poland would take a stand, would force other countries to implement what the Polish prime minister had perfectly defined: “The sanctions are supposed to bring peace to Ukraine, not peace to Europe's bad conscience. The sanctions are meant to stop Putin. If it didn't, then the sanctions aren't working."""
25146	9	"""It's time to say it out loud - when it comes to problems with the rule of law, much of what was reaching the West was the result of Russian disinformation,"" wrote Ambassador Mosbacher. Need to say more. The nonsense about the dictatorship in Poland was part of the campaign that turned Ukrainians into Nazis. And the participation of German media and foundations in it was not accidental. It is enough to trace the sources of this disinformation and everything is clear."
25146	11	The “totality” of the opposition resulted from the fact that the dispute between PiS and the opposition is not similar to the rivalry between the Republicans and the Democrats or the CDU and the SPD. Not the amount of taxes, moral issues are the most important in it. It is primarily a dispute between the option of Poland's independence and the alliance of Intermarium countries cooperating with the United States. And the Russian-German lobby, within which Russia is capable of the worst bestiality and genocide.
25146	13	And besides everything: those who sympathized with the actions of Fighting Solidarity hear in these days in the words of Mateusz Morawiecki an echo of the words of Kornel Morawiecki, proclaiming the ideas of brotherhood of nations and solidarity. The son carries out the work designed by the Father, as well as the Autonomous Eastern Department of Fighting Solidarity, led by Jadwiga Chmielowska and Piotr Hlebowicz.
25146	15	"In his master's thesis on Fighting Solidarity, Mateusz Morawiecki wrote: ""Solidarity in specific manifestations of social life, everyday life was supposed to be the implementation of Christian ideas of love of neighbor. >>Solidarity is a form of society's path to (...) a new (...) system which will undoubtedly contain the main values ​​carried by the Union - that is: democracy and real (...) social love<<. The idea of ​​solidarity is an attempt to transfer the principles of respect, understanding and love between individuals to relations between national, social or political groups. Solidarism was supposed to be a ""challenge to the individualistic, use-oriented Western capitalism"", but above all it was a counterproposal to the inhumane communist system."
25146	17	"Such are the ""Polish anti-Semites"", which of course Emmanuel Macron does not know."
25147	1	Nazis
25147	3	"The first pages of newspapers, popular ""ones"", should attract readers' attention. Preferably uniforms of armies you don't like."
25147	6	"Years ago, the weekly ""W Sieci"" appealed to journalists to stop the ""hysterical campaign of hatred"" on the ""topic"" of pedophilia among priests. And the editor-in-chief of ""Newsweek"", Tomasz Lis, appeared on the illustrative cover, depicted in the uniform of an SS soldier with the caption: ""Almost like Goebbels""."
25147	9	"And we don't like comparisons to Goebbels. Even the editor-in-chief of the weekly ""Nie"" rocked the courts for several years for ""Goebbels' martial law""."
25147	12	"But we are happy to quote. Quite recently, a distinguished opposition journalist, Waldemar Kuczyński, posted his considerations online: ""Why does this ""democratic"" press, dependent on foreign centers, not see how wonderfully we are changing the country? Why can't he see how much social programs give, how we restore morality after the mess created by predecessors?"". It was a quote, of course, from Joseph Goebbels from 1934."
25147	15	"Years later, Jacek Karnowski and ""Sieci"" are to apologize for the photo of Tomasz Lis in a Nazi uniform. Eight years after publication, justice has triumphed, the portals reported."
25147	18	"The amazing thing about all this is how often we like references to history. It's not the newest. Hitler came to power in 1933, it's been a while. Historians also recall that Adolf appeared on the cover of Time Weekly on January 2, 1939, as he was named ""Man of the Year 1938"". The war ended some seven decades ago. But it is still a current topic. Only in the recent period, a high-profile historian was appointed head of the Wrocław Institute of National Remembrance. Mein Kampf turned out to be a bestseller on the market. They're doing another reprint right now."
25147	21	Something's up. The publisher The Facto noted on its website at one time: “We love non-fiction. Unfortunately, the Polish publishing offer in this segment is poor - with the exception of books devoted to the biography of Adolf Hitler, Hitler's women, Hitler's henchmen, Hitler's generals, Hitler's agents, Hitler's architects, Hitler's dogs, Hitler's bunkers, Hitler's diet, assassinations on Hitler, Hitler's allies, tanks Hitler, Hitler's secret weapons, Hitler's doctors and Goering's underwear. Undoubtedly, the amateur Hitlerologist has a lot to pick from. Worse for the reader who would like to take a break from mustaches and struggles on the Eastern Front.
25147	24	However, the press reader cannot rest and is offended by graphics.
25147	27	"More modern Germany does not shy away from comparisons to brownness. The magazine Stern showed President Trump in a Nazi pose. Merkel surrounded by Nazis on the cover of Der Spiegel? No problem. Allied France: Macron Like Hitler? You're welcome. The daily ""Le Monde"" took care of it and rushed with such a cover. And what about the Czech Republic, would it be worse? In the popular weekly ""Refleks"", the face of the leader with a mustache, black, with lush Afro hair was published."
25147	30	"We have the weekly ""Wprost"" holding the palm of Hitler's priority. The cover with the title: ""The German Trojan Horse"". And on it Erika Steinbach in a known uniform, sitting on Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. The single ""Heil Lepper"" with the chairman of Self-Defense in the lead role must have infuriated Andrzej Lepper, who demanded up to one million zlotys in damages. ""They want to supervise Poland again"" and on the front of the new issue of the weekly, European politicians leaning over a map. Merkel in a leading role. A reference to the famous photograph of Hitler and generals over staff maps."
25147	33	"""Gazeta Polska"" also did not want to stay behind. Graphics with Donald Tusk in Nazi uniform. Can't you guess who? Very difficult. Bingo. With Angela Merkel. They got off the tram with the sign ""nur für Deutsche"". Well, what else would they come out of? Independence? Krzysztof Stanowski reacted to the tweet:"
25147	36	"""1. Be indignant at the Polish extermination camps in the media. Support the photomontage of the former Polish prime minister in a German WWII uniform. Logic?"""
25147	39	"Coming back to the case of Tomasz Lis. The publisher and the editor-in-chief, contrary to the verdict of Themis, do not intend to apologize. Because such a weekly ""W Sieci"" no longer exists. ""Network"" is. Just like there is no such city as London. There is Lądek. Lądek-Zdrój."
25147	42	Lawyers don't know what to say.
25147	45	"But imagine a situation that you were at the ""U Zdzicha"" inn and they covered you with a vegetable salad or eggs in mayonnaise. You stubbornly wanted compensation for gastric perturbations. And an independent court granted them. But beware. The inn ""U Zdzicha"" changed its name to ""Zdzisiek"" and you can jump us. For a ladle."
25147	48	Or staying on the war theme. Such a Germany might not pay war reparations. After all, the losses and damages caused by military operations were not caused by West Germany, but by the Third Reich. It's obvious, isn't it?
25149	1	The storm around Neo-nówka has not yet subsided.
25149	3	It's been a week of discussion about the Neo-Nówka sketch, which caused emotions among Poles. Monika Olejnik shared her opinion on this subject.
25149	5	For a week, a discussion about the sketch of the Neo-Nówka cabaret has been sweeping through Poland. The cabaret performers caused great emotions among Poles. First, a storm broke out on the Internet, which in subsequent stages engulfed politicians and political scientists.
25149	7	Today, there is nothing to hide that the scene from the life of Poles presented by Neo-Nówka has become pure politics. It is possible that the motif will be used by one of the parties trying to be in the middle of the political dispute in the upcoming election campaign.
25149	9	The sketch was politicized by PiS spokesman Radosław Fogiel, who would rather go to war with the members of the cabaret than turn the whole situation into a joke. This heated up the political context of Noe-Nówka's performance in Koszalin even more, and politicians and the cabaret began to respond to Fogel. The spokesman pushed the ball, which is already a snowball.
25149	11	"Monika Olejnik shared her observations in her latest column for ""Gazeta Wyborcza"". As the journalist emphasizes, the audience in Koszalin laughed until they burst into applause."
25149	13	Profanity may not suit some people, but this cabaret is the whole truth about our reality. Nobody lost their job for messy work, nobody lost their job because we pay fines every day. The enemy is Tusk, not Zbigniew Ziobro, because of whom Poland does not receive billions of zlotys – we read.
25149	15	Next, Monika Olejnik compares the tour of the country by politicians from the ruling camp to a cabaret.
25149	17	"President Kaczyński traveled around the country, attacking the Germans, and Mateusz Morawiecki does the same. Like in a cabaret. They are looking for enemies as in the times of Gomułka, when Germany could be blamed for everything – he writes in ""Wyborcza""."
25149	19	"Brilliant performance, but how to think that after a stupid change you will have to unscrew all these insertions from your knees .. Then the urge to laugh passes – commented one of the readers of ""Gazeta Wyborcza""."
2515	2	The left submits a bill on compulsory vaccination
2515	4	Our proposal for mandatory vaccinations against COVID-19 is an attempt to force the government to act, which wants to wait out the pandemic, said Krzysztof Gawkowski, chairman of the Left club.
2515	6	"Vaccination must be made compulsory so that people are healthier, so that they do not die, so that we do not have such a death rate – Gawkowski said on Monday on TVN 24. ""An open, wise, responsible party, such as the Left, wants to submit proposals, not wait; the government prefers to wait out the pandemic. There is no consent to that,"" he said"
2515	8	European solutions show that if we have various types of restrictions, they affect the fact that there are more people vaccinated - he added.
2515	10	"Gawkowski charged that ""the Minister of Health and the government coalition abdicated from the fight against the pandemic""; he also pointed out that last week, the Minister of Health, Adam Niedzielski, did not take part in ""three important debates on health"" in the Sejm."
2515	12	He also emphasized that vaccinations against certain diseases are also now mandatory in Poland, and parents who do not vaccinate their children will face penalties. According to Gawkowski, if vaccination against COVID-19 is introduced, the penalty for avoiding it should amount to several hundred zlotys, as in the case of evading the obligation to vaccinate children.
2515	14	The head of the Left club justified the announcement of the introduction of a draft law in this matter by saying that the proposal to regulate it by means of an ordinance remained unanswered.
2515	16	On Sunday, the Left presented a bill on the obligation to vaccinate against COVID-19 for adults; unvaccinated persons would be fined. Party leaders appealed to other formations to support this solution.
2515	18	PSL: The obligation to vaccinate results from the regulation of the Minister of Health
2515	20	"Kosiniak-Kamysz was asked in Rp.pl whether the Polish-PSL Coalition would support the Left's project if it goes to the Sejm. ""The obligation to vaccinate is not included in the act, but results from the regulation of the Minister of Health"" - he replied."
2515	22	"We have 14 diseases that are covered by mandatory vaccination against them: diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, hepatitis B - said the PSL leader. ""It really works well, and the Minister of Health has the best knowledge, he should have, if he is competent, effective, responsible - it happens and it happens that then he enters a specific disease on the list of mandatory vaccinations"" - he added. ""It is up to Minister (Adam) Niedzielski. I expect a declaration from him. I expect him to follow the recommendations of the Medical Council, listen to doctors, not surveys"" - he stressed."
2515	24	"Asked whether COVID-19 should be the fifteenth disease that is included in the list of mandatory vaccinations, Kosiniak-Kamysz replied: ""It is an infectious disease that spreads in such an uncontrolled way, there is an effective vaccine."" ""There is no vaccine more studied than the COVID-19 vaccine, there is no greater research field than now on COVID-19 vaccines, because there are millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people already vaccinated around the world, so this gives a gigantic safety value of this vaccine"" - added."
2515	26	"This is the decision of the Minister of Health - emphasized Kosiniak-Kamysz. ""If the analyzes of the government's Center for Strategic Analysis show that it should be introduced, let the Minister of Health make this decision as soon as possible"" - he added."
2515	28	"When asked if he was the Minister of Health, would he make such a decision, the leader of the People's Party replied: ""If we co-govern, we will make decisions."" ""Today, the opposition is not for this, because it does not have the knowledge to replace the rulers,"" he added."
2515	30	Kosiniak-Kamysz pointed out that the action regarding the obligation to vaccinate medics, nursing home employees and teachers should be taken seriously.
2515	32	Left-wing MP Adrian Zandberg said on Sunday that mandatory vaccinations, Covid passports and restrictions for unvaccinated people are needed to regain control of the health care situation. Employees - as he pointed out - should have the right to refuse to perform their duties in a situation where they are not provided with epidemic safety in the workplace.
2515	34	Deputy Minister of Health: It should be voluntary
2515	36	Since the beginning of the pandemic, I believe that it should be voluntary, that everyone should decide about their own life and health. Of course, some restrictions are necessary. But whether compulsory vaccinations, I would wonder about it - said the deputy head of the Ministry of Health Waldemar Kraska
2515	38	"He said the government might consider ""forced vaccination of certain occupational groups, we're talking about medical staff here."" ""The new data we have is that doctors are vaccinated at 92 percent, and nurses at 81 percent. We can still get better immunity here"" - said Kraska."
2515	40	The Deputy Minister of Health announced that the draft law on the Compensation Fund will be processed at the next session of the Sejm on 8-9 December.
2515	42	Kraska was also asked about the suggestion of the Ministry of Health before Christmas. A year ago, representatives of the government and the Ministry of Health called for limiting trips to Christmas and meeting only with the closest few people.
2515	44	I think the most important thing is to get vaccinated. Then this Christmas will definitely be warmer, safer. I wish this to all Poles, that we meet for the holidays as vaccinated people - said the deputy head of the Ministry of Health.
2515	46	"KO: ""That's not the way"""
2515	48	"On Monday, journalists asked Tomasz Siemoniak, deputy chairman of PO, whether KO could support this bill. ""I am in favor of vaccinations, I am after the third dose myself, I encourage others"" - said deputy chairman of PO Tomasz Siemoniak. ""While appreciating the good intentions of the project promoters, I believe that this is not the way to go. It is not a coincidence that only in one country, and only since February, such a system of compulsory vaccination has been introduced"" - he added."
2515	50	"In his opinion, a government that half-heartedly pursues a vaccination campaign should do much more. ""Forcing someone is a last resort, especially since it will lead to the flourishing of the gray economy. We are already hearing about false certificates"" - he stressed. He also pointed out that such an obligation does not require a law, but a regulation, and such a regulation may be issued by the Minister of Health."
2515	52	"Let's look for positive solutions - appealed Siemoniak. ""But we'll see, when the project is ready, what solutions will be there"" - he noted."
2515	54	For the time being, he added, the government does very little, the government plenipotentiary for vaccination has disappeared, there is no cooperation with the Church, and leaflets are sent to mailboxes about the Polish Deal, not about vaccinations. He added that in Portugal, which is culturally and materially close to Poland, there are about 90 percent of those vaccinated.
25150	1	Not Czarnek, not Najman, but Anna-Maria Żukowska. The MP of the Left won an unusual competition
25150	3	"Anna Maria-Żukowska from the Left won this year's competition for ""Biological Nonsense of the Year"". All thanks to the statement that ""there are situations when a biological man gives birth to a child."""
25150	5	Not every nomination for various plebiscites is a reason to be proud. There are competitions in which the presence among the nominees is not what we would like to boast about at a family dinner or an evening meeting with friends. And this was the fate of Anna-Maria Żukowska.
25150	7	"23 percent of Internet users decided that this year's award for ""Biological Nonsense of the Year"" will go to the MP of the Left. All because of the statement that ""there are situations when a biological man gives birth to a child."" The quote comes from one of the programs on TVP Info. What was the moral of that? Perversely, it can be said that it is better not to show up on TVP."
25150	9	The MP left solid competition behind. On the podium of the competition were Jan Duda and his theory about contagious homosexuality, as well as Marcin Najman, who found the cells of a killed child in the vaccines of AstraZeneka and Johnson & Johnson. Following the fate of Najman's career, the lack of victory should not surprise anyone.
25150	11	"Last year, Kaja Godek won for the statement that ""there is no such thing as orientation"". We will only add that there is no such city - London. By the way, a pro-life activist could cover this plebiscite with honorary patronage."
25151	1	Silver for Sunday (because silence is golden)
25151	3	France will pay
25151	5	"The leader of the National Rally, Marine Le Pen, who came to Poland for the Warsaw Summit, a meeting of the leaders of 13 European right-wing parties, referred to the actions of the Polish government in the dispute with Brussels in an interview for ""Rzeczpospolita"". Moreover, she declared that: “The CJEU imposed one million euros of daily fines on Poland for violating the rule of law. Well, France will pay this penalty for Poland! We are a net contributor to the EU budget and we will subtract these costs from our overpayment.” We would like to remind you that Mrs Le Pen is running in the presidential election in her country once again. I wonder if her voters have already read the interview and what they think about paying the bills for PiS. I have a vague feeling that such declarations of support for the golden-haired Marine will not increase much ..."
25151	7	Warsaw in Budapest? Gladly!
25151	9	"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who also visited Warsaw for the Warsaw Summit, failed to appeal the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union to the Hungarian Constitutional Court. The CJEU issued a judgment against Hungary in December 2020 following a complaint from the European Commission that its asylum provisions violate EU law. The Orban government submitted the CJEU judgment to the Hungarian Constitutional Court for scrutiny. Unfortunately, it turned out that the Hungarian Constitutional Court ruled that: ""it is not able to challenge the ruling of the CJEU or examine the supremacy of EU law."" We advise Prime Minister Orban to go to Warsaw in case of another controversy with the CJEU. There, Mrs. Julia Przyłębska will not only prepare the sentence according to his wishes, but also cook a tasty goulash..."
25151	11	Experimental Horala
25151	13	"Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Marcin Horała, and at the same time the head of the Central National Pasture, spoke about vaccines against COVID-19 in the ""Express Biedrzycka"" program. Well, he said that they are ""experimental"" because: ""Normally, research on vaccines takes many years, and in this case there was no time for it."" In addition, Mr. Horała announced that: ""Of course, limiting the development of the epidemic and protecting human health and life are important, but values ​​such as personal freedom and the right to be responsible for oneself are also extremely important and constitutionally protected."" How much love for the constitution and what love of freedom is in the heart of Mr. Deputy Minister ... I wonder if he has already been vaccinated as part of the civic attitude?"
25151	15	Christmas break
25151	17	"Deputy Minister of Sport Łukasz Mejza, according to Wirtualna Polska, founded Vinci NeoClinic in 2020. This company offered treatment of cancers and neurological diseases that are incurable by modern medicine. It was also supposed to help with autism, strokes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscle wasting. For such a wide offer, she demanded from 80,000 dollars and upwards. Mr. Mejza, instead of resigning after such a scandal, launched a bizarre defense by attacking the independent media and the opposition. Then, apparently having convinced no one, he got a little offended and went on leave. He informed about all this on Facebook, writing: ""Due to the merciless media attack on me on political grounds, at Wednesday's briefing I announced the filing of dozens of lawsuits/court applications, which I have implemented and continue to implement. In order to fully devote myself to the fight for my good name, truth and justice in the coming weeks, I suspend my participation in the work of the Ministry of Sport and Tourism. I also applied to the Marshal of the Sejm for a leave of absence from the performance of parliamentary duties. Hmmm, but is Minister Mejza aware that in order to defend a good name, one must first have it..."
25151	19	Roman the Unbreakable
25151	21	For several weeks, Roman Giertych has been preparing a lawsuit to the Hague Tribunal against the governments of the United Right. Meanwhile, he was recently summoned to the prosecutor's office again in connection with the investigation into the withdrawal of money from a listed company. Supposedly to supplement the allegations. It is true that the court had already issued a verdict stating that there were no grounds to charge and arrest Mr. Roman and to apply other preventive measures. However, the prosecution stated that if the lawyer failed to appear before the investigators again, it intended to apply for pre-trial detention. In response to the position of the prosecutor's office, Giertych recalled that the courts had ruled that there were no grounds for his arrest and declared that he would still not appear when summoned. The case is developing, but I'm betting on Roman!
25151	23	I'm obsessed with the uniform
25151	25	"Jacek Kurski, president of TVP, came up with a great idea. Wanting to support the soldiers serving on the border, he decided to organize a concert entitled ""Wall Behind the Polish Uniform"". This patriotic event for soldiers, which at the 23rd Tactical Air Base in Mińsk Mazowiecki, turned out to be one of the most expensive in the history of the station. President Kurski did not skimp on the concert for soldiers, so he spent a fortune even greater than the one he planned for this year's New Year's Eve on TVP. Foreign stars (admittedly somewhat forgotten) such as Oceana or Loona did not impress the audience, who were disgusted by the choice of dance repertoire for the patriotic occasion. However, they still got 100,000 for the performance, even though they sang with playback. Even the immortal Edyta Górniak, who was one of the few who dared to sing live, did not save the situation. Well done TVP!"

25152	3	Resourceful Richard Henry
25152	5	MEP Ryszard Czarnecki is undoubtedly very resourceful and thrifty, especially in financial matters. Well, last year, in addition to the salary from the European Parliament, paid in euros, he also receives transfers from the Polish Volleyball Association, where he has been vice-president for international affairs since April 2018. He declared that he would work there for charity, out of pure love for volleyball, but if they give him 10,000 PLN gross every month, he won't refuse. In addition, PZPS can also be nibbled on kilometers, so it would be a pity not to use it. Ryszard Czarnecki's car journeys cost the Polish Volleyball Association at least PLN 75,000, and according to the documents - only in the period between mid-November last year and the end of May 2021, the MEP refueled at the expense of PZPS almost 100 times and poured his official Citroen C5 Aircross into the tank over 3.5 thousand liters of diesel. If you believe the results of combustion tests of this car model, the politician could drive about 55,000 kilometers in half a year. It would thus go around the Earth along the equator and start another lap. As he explains himself, at that time he participated in many meetings in the volleyball world and matches at four levels of competition. And do you remember his winter journeys in a scrapped convertible?
25152	7	Just a little sun
25152	9	"The words of President Andrzej Duda on the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19, which were spoken on June 15 during the GlobSec 2021 conference in Bratislava, surprised and surprised some people. Well, PAD said that it is not sure whether, observing the recent decrease in the number of infections: ""we can actually be happy that it is the effect of vaccination, or whether it is simply the result of the fact that we have such and no other weather conditions."" And he continued in the same spirit: ""Can we say that if the number of cases in my country, Poland, has now fallen to the same level per day as we recorded exactly a year ago, that is, between 200 and 400 cases every day, can we really be happy that this is the effect of vaccination, or is it simply the result of the fact that we have such and no other weather conditions, [that] this is the time of the year? We didn't have a vaccine last year, and there were just as many cases."" Anti-vaccine supporters applaud Andrzej Duda…"
25152	11	What to use your intelligence for…
25152	13	"Monika Olejnik invited the Marshal of the Senate, Tomasz Grodzki, to ""Kropka nad i"" and during the conversation she asked him about the attack on Minister Dworczyk's e-mail address. The Marshal stated: “This is a very serious matter and at least those who have endangered the security of the state should consider ending their activities in the government. (...) If we add to this that the deputy prime minister for security (Jarosław Kaczyński) talks about Russia's plans to invade Poland at a secret session of the Sejm, then I cannot imagine that the president would not urgently convene the National Security Council.' The journalist also asked the question: ""Is Jarosław Kaczyński an outstanding politician?"" The marshal, after a short thought, said: ""Some people use their intelligence for a bad purpose."" There is no point in quoting the exchange of views on President Andrzej Duda."
25152	15	Leisure at the university
25152	17	"Our favorite Malopolska curator of education, Barbara Nowak, flashed with her intellect again. A few days ago, she tweeted: ""Shock! The Jagiellonian University turns into an escort agency! Prepares an offer by gender. The first Polish higher education institution, dating back to 1364, applies neo-Marxist segregation of students.” The curator attached a picture of the question from the survey to her entry, in which students are to indicate their gender, and they can choose from, among others: woman, man, transwoman, transman, non-binary. It is a voluntary, anonymous and confidential survey, and the data collected in it are presented to the university authorities, and then on the website of the Safe Department. The results of the survey are also intended to be used for scientific research. In an open letter to Lesser Poland, the curator of the Jagiellonian University, Professor Jacek Popiel, wrote that knowing her previous statements, he did not expect an apology for words aimed at members of the academic community."
25152	19	Even though she wanted to, she didn't get it
25152	21	"The majority of senators voted against the PiS-backed candidacy of Lidia Staroń for the Ombudsman. Undoubtedly, the result was influenced by her embarrassing speech before the vote and the lack of answers to questions from senators. When asked about it by journalists, the senator said: ""I do not regret it, I am very happy that I was a candidate."" And when asked about the reasons for the defeat, she said: ""When you fight for people, and you are not in this or that party, that's how it is."" Well, if the main motivation for the candidacy was the fact that ""she really wants to"", then there is no wonder."

25153	5	One in eight infected may have long covid
25153	7	It has been known for some time that some people who have been infected with COVID-19 have health problems for long months due to long covid.
25153	9	"The article published by the scientific magazine ""The Lancet"" shows that Dutch scientists managed to determine exactly how many patients still suffer chronically after the disease. UMC employees conducted research among 13,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands, which shows that 12.7 percent of patients continued to suffer from symptoms three to five months after infection."
25153	11	These mainly included chest pain, loss of smell and taste, fatigue and muscle aches, Professor Judith Rosmalen, who led the team that conducted the study, told NU. Their authors also mention general breathing problems, pain associated with this activity, feeling cold or hot, tingling (or heaviness) in the legs and arms, general feeling of tiredness.
25153	13	"Since 2006, the University Medical Center has been conducting research on the health situation of the population in the north of the Netherlands as part of the so-called Lifelines project. ""Therefore, we were able to check very carefully whether people really developed new ailments after coronavirus infection"" - points out Professor Rosmalen."

25156	1	Our generosity knows no bounds. We spent almost PLN 26 billion to help Ukrainians
25156	3	Approx. PLN 10 billion is the estimated value of Poles' private spending on helping refugees from Ukraine in the first months of the war, according to a report by the Polish Economic Institute. It was added that public expenditure is about PLN 15.9 billion. Public, i.e. also paid from our pockets.
25156	5	"""The estimated value of the total annual expenditure of public authorities for helping refugees, together with the amount of private expenditure of Poles incurred for this purpose only during the first three months of the war, amounts to PLN 25.4 billion in total,"" said Piotr Arak, director of PIE quoted in the report. He added that this corresponds to 0.97 percent. Polish GDP in 2021"
25156	7	As for public expenditure related to guaranteeing refugees access to benefits and social assistance, as well as the possibility of health care and education, it amounts to approx. PLN 15.9 billion.
25156	9	In-kind assistance and money transfers
25156	11	According to PIE, in the first months, 70 percent of people participated in aid activities. adults, and half were involved in helping refugees in a consistent manner, i.e. both at the beginning of the war and in the subsequent weeks of hostilities.
25156	13	The most popular forms of support, as pointed out by Agnieszka Wincewicz-Price, an expert from the Polish Economic Institute, were in-kind assistance and money transfers. The institute reported that 59 percent of respondents were involved in the purchase of necessary items, and 53 percent. donated money to refugees. “The less frequently used forms of support were assistance in settling various types of matters for refugees (20% of respondents) and involvement in volunteering (17% of respondents). In turn, 7 percent of the respondents declared that they had made their own flat available to refugees,” Wincewicz-Price pointed out.
25156	15	In total, according to the study, Poles spent PLN 9-10 billion on helping refugees. It was also noted that this is more than spending on charity in the whole of 2021.
25156	17	Involvement quite common, regardless of earnings
25156	19	It was written that among people with the highest income (over PLN 5,000 net), the percentage of people who provided the greatest help to refugees was three times higher than among people with the lowest income (below PLN 2,000). It was also noted that even among people earning less than 2,000 net PLN, involvement in helping was quite common, and only 26 percent. people in this group did not help in any way. It was also noted that the level of education of the helpers turned out to be important. People with higher education were more involved in helping (about 10 percentage points more than people from other groups).
25156	21	It was pointed out that strong involvement in helping Ukrainians was also related to such factors as: experience in charity before the war, direct contact with foreigners (especially Ukrainians) before the war, and regular monitoring of media information on the ongoing war and the fate of refugees. “Interestingly, women were more likely than men to be involved in helping refugees. A total lack of involvement in helping is described by 28 percent. surveyed men, with only 19 percent women. In turn, taking into account age, it turns out that among younger people there were the most strongly involved, but also the most people who did not help - 27 percent. people aged 20-34 did not help refugees at all (but as many as 18 percent can be classified as strongly involved in helping)” – it was written.
25156	23	And now we have to deal with them somehow
25156	25	The authors of the report indicated that over time the number of people actively involved in helping refugees decreased. At the turn of April and May, 57 percent. of respondents declared participation in some form of aid activities (70% of adults at the beginning of the conflict). However, it was noted that 50% of indicated involvement both at the beginning of the war and later, when the study was carried out.
25156	27	"It was also pointed out that the help of the Polish society in the first days and weeks of the war had not only a material dimension, but also a largely symbolic one, because in many cases it was ahead of institutional help and had a significant impact on shaping public opinion in other countries. ""At the next stage, referred to by the authors of the report as adaptation, the key role of the state continued, as it was necessary to include refugees in the social and state system by enabling access to public and social infrastructure and providing institutional support"" - indicated in the report."
25156	29	It was noted that at the next stage of integration, it will be necessary to ensure social cohesion, leveling social tensions between new immigration and Polish society, as well as enabling smooth integration in schools, public institutions, workplaces and wherever intensive contacts between refugees and Polish citizens.
25157	1	Ukrainians make up 8% of the Polish population, in Wrocław - 28%
25157	3	Although the number of Ukrainians in Poland fell to 3.37 million in May, they still make up 8 percent of the population. of the country's population, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported on Monday. DGP referred to the results of the latest report commissioned by the Union of Polish Metropolises (UMP), an organization associating 12 largest cities in the country.
25157	5	Data based on the analysis of information from smartphones and the register of PESEL numbers (a list of numbers obtained by Ukrainians since the Russian invasion on February 24) give a picture of both Ukrainian immigrants from before the war and the last wave of refugees.
25157	7	The data shows that in most of the cities surveyed, the number of Ukrainians decreased after the April peak, with two exceptions - Wrocław and Warsaw. The UMP report also shows which cities have the largest proportion of Ukrainians.
25157	9	At the bottom of the list are Bydgoszcz and Łódź, where Ukrainians account for 10 percent. inhabitants. In the case of Wrocław, it is 28 percent, and in Warsaw 16 percent, although in absolute terms the highest number is in the capital.
25157	11	"The highest percentage of Ukrainians in relation to the number of inhabitants is in Rzeszów (37%), although this result was given with the reservation of the authors of the report: ""One can wonder to what extent Rzeszów and the surrounding area are only a stop on the route to other places in Poland and Europe, and to what extent is it a place where Ukrainian refugees are oriented towards a relatively quick return to their country.”"
25158	1	"Controversial opinion of a German politician. ""Not only Russia, but also the US is bad"""
25158	3	"The Minister of Transport of Baden-Württemberg, Winfried Hermann from the Green party, included a rather controversial opinion in his work on the war. He claims that the roles of Russia and the West are perceived too one-sidedly in connection with the war in Ukraine. In his opinion, not only Russia is ""militant"" and ""evil"", and US interventions have brought much destruction instead of peace and democracy."
25158	5	"The armed conflicts and military engagements of the last 30 years do not justify the image that only Russia is +militant+ and +evil+ in repeatedly asserting its interests by military force, Hermann wrote in a work-related war learned by the dpa agency. ""Especially the US interventions have brought much destruction instead of peace and democracy"" - said the author."
25158	7	The US violated international law
25158	9	"Since the end of the Soviet Union, Russia has been waging brutal wars in violation of international law, with proven war crimes in Russia's alleged spheres of interest, such as Chechnya, Georgia and Syria, continued Hermann. However, the US - backed by individual NATO nations such as France, Britain and Germany - intervened in the same period ""with concentrated military force and partly also in violation of international law in Iraq, Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, etc."""
25158	11	"Hermann also criticized ""missed opportunities for peace"" since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. The opportunity for a new ""security architecture with arms control and disarmament that also takes into account the interests of the former Soviet states and Russia"" has been lost in favor of NATO's eastward expansion."
25158	13	Reply of a Ukrainian diplomat
25158	15	"Former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk commented on these views on Twitter: ""instead of relativizing Russia's disgusting war crimes in Ukraine, you should rather worry about overcrowded regional trains."""
25159	1	The French government has decided. He will appoint ... an ambassador for LGBT+ rights
25159	3	French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne intends to create the position of an ambassador for LGBT+ rights and a fund of €3 million to set up new LGBT+ centres. Moreover, the French government does not rule out compensation for people who have been persecuted in the past because of their sexual orientation.
25159	5	The post of LGBT+ ambassador is to be created before the end of the year. There will be 10 new LGBT+ centers in addition to the 35 existing ones.
25159	7	Borne announced her decision on Thursday during a visit to an LGBT+ center in Orléans to mark the 40th anniversary of the repeal of the Vichy regime's discriminatory penal code against homosexual unions.
25159	9	"According to the Prime Minister, the ambassador ""will coordinate the activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect against discrimination and promote LGBT+ rights, and will carry the voice of France to the world"", especially advocating ""the universal decriminalization of homosexuality and transgender identification."""
25159	11	In turn, a bill presented by Socialist Senator Hussein Bourgi demands compensation for those convicted of homosexuality between 1942 and 1982. Borne said she would look into the document. Healing wounds that may have been inflicted by discrimination is not an easy topic, she added.
25159	13	The Vichy regime introduced a law in 1942 criminalizing homosexual relations with persons under the age of 21. At the same time, the age of consent for heterosexuals was 15. In 1974, the age of consent for homosexual relations was raised to 18. In 1982, it was equalized with the limit provided for heterosexual relations.
2516	2	Tomasz Pietryga: The case of Sylwia Spurek
2516	4	The behavior of the MEP shows well that ecofanaticism can lead to a dehumanizing perception of the world.
2516	6	"Sylwia Spurek, MEP, former deputy ombudsman, just before the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where about 1.5 million people died, mostly Jews, allowed herself to post a drawing by artist Jo Frederiks on social media, showing cows in camp striped uniforms, with stars on their breasts, led to the slaughter. Commenting: ""It makes you think, it opens your eyes to how we treat animals."" And further: ""It's time for a serious discussion about the treatment of animals, about the conditions in which they live, about how we kill them...""."
2516	8	"Spurek presents an unwavering stance on this matter. Within a year, from an activist defending the rights of victims of domestic violence, she turned into an ecologist who took the protection of animals to the banners. The famous video in which she protested against the ""rape"" of milking cows during the campaign for the European Parliament, and several similar statements seemed to be an extreme approach. It turns out, however, that the MEP's tendency to extremes has no limits."
2516	10	One can understand the arguments of environmentalists who often invoke drastic examples to move people's consciences. However, there is always a matter of prudence and proportion. The Holocaust is the worst material for such comparisons. There are areas that happeners should stay away from. Out of respect for the seriousness of those events. These issues, it would seem, are obvious to civilized people. And yet not for everyone. The politician who endorses the comparison of farm animals to people being treated like cattle being led to slaughter does not seem to understand this.
2516	12	With his attitude, he not only violates the seriousness of the Holocaust, but also harms the environmental movement. And also Poland. She is an MEP representing our country. With such statements, he seems to join the orchestra of Putin playing on the note of Polish anti-Semitism.
25160	1	Fourth heatwave in France. Temperatures will reach 40 degrees C
25160	3	In many French cities, the temperature will exceed 35 degrees C from Monday, and in the following days it will reach 40 degrees locally. The fourth heatwave, according to meteorologists, will last longer than the previous ones; will last until at least August 15.
25160	5	Due to the forecasted heat in various departments of France, weather alerts are to be issued, which are already in force in Gard and Vaucluse.
25160	7	In Bordeaux, in the south-west of the country, the temperature will reach 35 degrees on Monday and will reach 37 degrees between Tuesday and Friday, Meteo-France predicts. Locally, temperatures in this area can reach as high as 40 degrees. It will also be very hot at night; in Bordeaux from Tuesday to Friday evening, the temperature is expected to be 25-26 degrees.
25160	9	The appearance of the fourth heatwave is explained by the meteorological conditions observed over the European continent. A powerful anticyclone associated with dry and hot weather is currently over the British Isles, and through Portugal, the hot air current from the Sahara reaches France, experts explain.
25160	11	The fourth heatwave will deepen the drought that has been going on in the country for several weeks and the threat of fire, the meteorological service warns. The previous wave of high temperatures peaked in France on August 3.
25161	1	"Our dear Antoni Macierewicz. It ""costs"" PLN 500 more per day than other MPs"
25161	3	Antoni Macierewicz, as one of the few rank and file deputies, enjoys privileges worthy of a minister. He still enjoys full state protection. Although specific data is unknown, according to professionals, it can cost up to PLN 600 a day.
25161	5	Mariusz Błaszczak, who replaced Antoni Macierewicz as Minister of Defense 4.5 years ago. One of the first decisions he made was to establish the protection of the Military Police for his predecessor. It made a special decision.
25161	7	"The opposition, although, according to ""Fact"", tried to find out what costs this protection generates, bounced off the wall. The Ministry of the Interior hides behind the act on the protection of classified information and the security of protected persons. He noted, however, that the protection is within the scope of the Military Police's responsibilities, therefore ""does not expose the state treasury to additional expenses"". The officers on duty could perform other duties while protecting an ""ordinary"" MP, which is why, as Monika Rosa from Nowoczesna argues, ""this is a frivolous treatment of citizens and budget funds, because everyone pays for it."""
25161	9	Antoni Macierewicz himself is also silent on this issue.
25161	11	According to Jerzy Dziewulski, the cost of such protection should be estimated at several hundred zlotys a day (approx. PLN 500 - 600). This is basic protection consisting of two people. It was not included in used car.
25163	1	Niedzielski: The contagiousness of monkeypox is not high
25163	3	When it comes to actions against monkey pox, first of all, we see that the transmission mechanisms are not so sensitive, and the infectiousness is not high, said Health Minister Adam Niedzielski in an interview with Interia on Monday.
25163	5	When asked by Interia about the actions taken in connection with monkey pox, the minister replied that the Polish services acted perfectly.
25163	7	A visit to a doctor, a preliminary diagnosis of a possible infection with monkey pox, immediate isolation, a quick epidemiological interview, talking to people from the circle of people at risk of infection, putting them under surveillance, and in the meantime transferring the genetic material to the NIZP-PZH and testing - it all worked as it should he explained. He added that the patient is feeling well and people around him have no symptoms of the disease.
25163	9	The head of the Ministry of Health announced that there are other suspects of infection, but they are all waiting in hospital in isolation for the results of the test. People who have had contact with them are identified by the sanitary inspection.
25163	11	There is nothing to be afraid of, although more cases will probably appear in Poland. However, I recommend calmness and distance from any pessimistic visions, stressed Niedzielski.
25163	13	He assessed that over the last two years, work has been done to improve both the operation of the hospital system and the sanitary inspection. In addition, he explained, Poland is prepared for the equipment needed to treat a large number of people.

25163	17	Monkey pox is a rare zoonotic viral disease. It is usually found in West and Central Africa. Symptoms include fever, headaches and a skin rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Cases of infection with the monkeypox virus have recently been recorded, e.g. in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Austria and Sweden.
25164	1	"The Together party asks the government about the nuclear. ""There is no real will to implement"""
25164	3	The Together party submitted an interpellation to the prime minister regarding the nuclear project. It contains questions about the key issues related to the implementation of this project.
25164	5	"A group of politicians from the Together party, composed of Maciej Konieczny, Magdalena Biejat, Daria Gosek-Popiołek, Paulina Matysiak, Adrian Zandberg and Marcelina Zawisza, sent an interpellation to the Prime Minister regarding the Polish nuclear project. The ""Polish Nuclear Energy Program"" is one of the largest infrastructural projects in Poland, necessary to carry out the energy transformation and move away from fossil fuels. Its efficient implementation, together with the development of renewable energy sources, is necessary to provide Poles with cheap electricity and reduce Poland's dependence on imports of energy carriers. At the same time, despite its lack of alternatives, it seems that there is no real will to implement it. One may have doubts whether it is conducted in a well-thought-out and planned manner at all, ""the parliamentarians write."
25164	7	"“One can observe a disturbing chaos inside the Council of Ministers, lack of cooperation between the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure and Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe sp. Polish nuclear energy, based on constructions not built anywhere in the world"" - they add."
25164	9	In the interpellation, parliamentarians pose a number of questions about the implementation of the nuclear project. “Why was there no competitive selection process for the supplier of the construction of nuclear units in the form of, for example, an inquiry with specific conditions, but instead, non-binding and, in the absence of guidelines, incomparable offers from suppliers were relied on? What risk does this pose in the procedure leading to the consent of the European Commission for state aid? Why the environmental impact report, submitted to the General Directorate for Environmental Protection and prepared by Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe sp. z o.o. for Lubiatowo-Kopalino and Żarnowiec is based solely on Westinghouse AP1000 technology, even though a supplier has not yet been selected?” - these are just some of the total of 14 issues raised by the Together Party.
25165	1	DIFFERENT FRONTS OF ONE WAR
25165	3	Further Russian crimes in Ukraine are accompanied by actions aimed at causing a deep economic crisis in Europe. Russia hopes that this will be a way to win the war.
25165	6	"The situation on the Russian-Ukrainian front in recent days is easiest to sum up with the statement: ""no major changes"". Russia is still unable to control the entirety of Donbas, although it continues to attack. Ukraine is starting the forced evacuation of the population of parts of the Donetsk region and at the same time sending signals of readiness for a counter-offensive towards Kherson, although it still lacks more Western weapons."
25165	8	At the same time, Russian attacks on civilian objects have become commonplace, and the specific routinization of crimes committed by Russians means that many Western media only report on the most blatant ones. One of the most recent examples was the attack on the barracks for Ukrainian POWs in Ołeniwka, which resulted in at least 40 deaths and 130 wounded. Russian propaganda immediately declared that the explosion was caused by the Ukrainian side.
25165	10	The Kremlin has a long tradition of murdering prisoners of war, and this time it may have been to cover up the bestial abuse. In recent days, recordings have been posted online showing how the Russians barbarously treat captured Ukrainian prisoners. In Ukrainian society, this does not cause defeatism as much as Moscow would like, but it increases the will to resist and strengthens the belief that this is a war for physical survival.
25165	12	Against this background, a positive signal may be the agreement concluded on 22 July on the unblocking of three Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, which is intended to enable the resumption of exports of Ukrainian grain. The document was negotiated with the participation of the UN, and Turkey became its midwife. The first transport left Odessa on August 1, but the key question is about the durability of the agreement and its observance by Russia. In the Kremlin's calculations, the blockade of food exports from Ukraine was intended not only to deepen the problems of the Ukrainian economy, but also to cause a food crisis in the countries of the global South, the effects of which would backfire on the West. It would seem that Russia has no interest in lifting the blockade from Ukrainian ports. Unless the price for this will be a genuine loosening of some Western sanctions. There is also no doubt that Moscow may restore the blockade at any time, accusing Kyiv of fabricated provocations. In the absurdity of lies, the Kremlin continues to break its own records.
25165	14	"So far, Russia has focused on the energy front, reducing supplies via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline by 80 percent. Even the strongest believers in the rationality of Russia as a supplier of raw materials got rid of their illusions - the Kremlin is aiming to push up energy prices to exorbitant heights in order to deepen the economic problems of the European Union. If anyone hasn't figured it out yet, Moscow still bluntly reminds us that it has declared an energy war of attrition on us. Russian calculations are simple – affluent and comfortable Europe, facing the prospect of a cold winter, the need to shut down some industry, high inflation and mass dissatisfaction of voters, will act ""pragmatically"", i.e. lift some of the sanctions and force Kyiv to make concessions."
25165	16	"Moscow has no chance here, since even the head of Ukrainian diplomacy, Dmytro Kuleba, had to publicly remark: “Under the pretext of the need to improve the [gas] situation before winter, some of our Western partners are beginning to be tempted to negotiate with Russia. We calmly explain to them why their hopes for Russia's constructive position are inconsistent with reality."""
25165	18	However, it is more likely that the Kremlin will achieve the opposite effect to that intended – Europe will survive the winter without Russian gas, which will force it to accelerate (albeit extremely costly) de-Russification of its energy sectors. In the ongoing war on many fronts, the winner will be the one who maintains more consistency and stubbornness. Whoever blinks first will lose.
25166	1	"Interview with Kaczynski. ""Our enemies wanted a primitive Poland, and Tusk is building it"""
25166	3	"Donald Tusk fulfills a ""foreign order"", i.e. supports German policy - Jarosław Kaczyński states in the latest interview in the ""Sieci"" weekly. The PiS leader also assessed that the PO chairman had decided to ""extremely brutalize public life""."
25166	5	Already in his first speeches he spoke about the division into good and evil, he claimed that it was enough to hit harder and encouraged to do so. Now he has decided on extreme brutalization and animization of public life, Jarosław Kaczyński said in an interview with Michał Karnowski. I'm putting it in a tradition. Our enemies have always wanted a primitive, vulgar and culture-rejecting Poland. This is what Tusk is building on a foreign order, he said.
25166	7	"Kaczyński then assessed that the ""foreign order"" was the implementation of German policy. He also added that in his opinion, our western neighbors want ""dominance over the whole of Europe""."
25166	9	"Michał Karnowski asked about the introduction of the euro currency in Poland. Karnowski stated that this could lead to the ""takeover"" of the National Bank of Poland. He also referred to a recent interview in ""Sieci"" with the President of the National Bank of Poland, Adam Glapiński, who in turn spoke of ""mad attacks on the institution he heads""."
25166	11	In order to introduce the euro, the constitution must be changed, which they have little chance of doing. That is why they would like to achieve this by the Constitutional Tribunal, which would rule on what is clearly written there about the currency in force in Poland, and does not mean what it means. Such voices have already appeared - said the PiS politician in response.
25166	13	Kaczyński about Donald Tusk
25166	15	"In an interview with Jarosław Kaczyński, the topic of Donald Tusk also appears during the discussion on defense and the development of the Polish army. The PiS president said that Donald Tusk was only ""rolling up the Polish army"" and he himself joined the government to ""carry out a radical plan to strengthen Polish defense""."
25168	1	Kim Jong Un wants to support Putin's army. Here's what North Korea has.
25168	3	North Korea can help Russia by sending its troops to Donbass. As part of the proposal made to Putin by Kim Jong Un, up to 100,000 would be sent to pro-Kremlin self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine. soldiers. This would be a serious support for Putin, whose army has more and more problems recruiting volunteers. Let's check what capabilities and equipment the North Korean army has.
25168	5	According to media reports, Kim Jong Un made an offer to Putin under which North Korea will send to the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People's Republic not only their employees, but also as many as 100,000. soldiers. This is a serious force, which theoretically could be a serious problem for the Ukrainian army fighting in the east of its country. In exchange for the transfer of its units to the Donbas, North Korea would receive supplies of grain and energy from Russia.
25168	7	However, Russia may depend not only on human strength, but also on the artillery systems possessed by the North Koreans. Pyongyang has been investing huge amounts of money in its rocket batteries and missiles, including hypersonic structures, for years, using them to intimidate its neighbors and provoke the United States. Unfortunately, it does it at the expense of its inhabitants, neglecting other industries than the military.
25168	9	If the Russians receive support from North Korea, then, unfortunately, the Ukrainians may have serious problems with the potential rebound of the self-proclaimed pro-Kremlin republics. It is not clear, however, whether North Korean soldiers could take an active part in offensive operations and take over the territory of Ukraine, or whether they will limit themselves to shelling with the use of their artillery.
25168	11	And the North Korean artillery itself is really powerful, as you will see by looking at the list of weapons that North Korea currently has at its disposal below.
25169	1	"Tusk irritates the opposition? ""It works according to the strategy of Tomasz Lis"""
25169	3	Smaller opposition parties are said to be irritated by Donald Tusk's actions regarding contamination of the Oder river and false reports about the presence of mercury.
25169	5	"The case is reported by the portalprost.pl. ""Small opposition parties are furious with Donald Tusk for continuing the narrative about the increased level of mercury in the Oder river, even when it was already known that the research did not confirm it,"" the website reads."
25169	7	Opposition activists are of the opinion that Tusk did the wrong thing by repeating the lie. Such tactics may discourage the moderate centrist electorate.
25169	9	"– Common-sense voters may not like this – assesses directly.pl from the opposition's interlocutor. In his opinion, Tusk acts in accordance with the strategy once formulated by Tomasz Lis, who claimed that ""everyone has their own facts""."
25169	12	– The iron voter of PiS believes that Germany probably polluted the Oder. And a strong supporter of the Civic Platform believes in mercury, even when research does not confirm it. Only iron electorates do not win elections alone, we read.
25169	14	The opposition attacks PiS
25169	16	"The chairman of the Civic Platform, Donald Tusk, criticizing the government, wrote in social media that ""not only fish in the Oder are being killed, the entire country under Kaczyński's rule is being killed"", and ""PiS is like mercury"". In turn, Poland 2050 by Szymon Hołownia is to appoint crisis staffs in areas where the entire Oder flows. Experts will monitor the situation, warn and support residents."
25169	18	Recently, an MP from the Civic Coalition, Katarzyna Lubnauer, also referred to the issue of river pollution. Last Wednesday, she published documents online after a parliamentary inspection at the Government Security Center. The letters concerned the reaction of the state authorities to the ecological disaster in the Odra River.
25169	20	Prolongation of the ban
25169	22	The West Pomeranian Voivode took part in Friday's press conference with the participation of Minister Anna Moskwy. Earlier, Zbigniew Bogucki himself met with media representatives to announce the decision to extend the ban on approaching the Oder water. The ban will remain in effect until Thursday, August 25 this year. The decision was expected and was ultimately to be made after consultations with local government officials and fishermen.
25169	24	The governor explained that the authorities wanted to avoid extending the ban every few days to allow for proper planning of activities for people using the river in some way.
2517	2	Kukiz on the unvaccinated: If someone wants to hang themselves, they can do it
2517	4	I will support the budget presented by the government - said Kukiz'15 leader Paweł Kukiz in an interview with RMF FM.
2517	6	I am glad that so much depends on our votes, because thanks to this I am able to introduce laws that I would never be able to introduce on my own in my life - said Kukiz, pointing out that the ruling majority, including in the vote on the budget depends on the votes of Kukiz'15 deputies.
2517	8	In return, I got an anti-corruption bill that had already been signed by the president. We got a change in the mink regulation. We received compensation for benefits for carers of disabled people, PLN 30,000. families will be fairly treated, these people have been seeking for fair treatment for many years, enumerated Kukiz.
2517	10	We got a direct sale to farmers, justices of the peace are already under debate in the Sejm - he added.
2517	12	I'm not threatening - that's how Kukiz replied to the question of why, if cooperation with PiS is so good, he threatens the ruling party that he will not vote with it if Łukasz Mejza remains the deputy minister of sport. – I am not withdrawing from it, this is not a threat, blackmail, etc. I spoke with the president Jarosław Kaczyński and at one point I said that the president should not treat this issue, which I will discuss in a moment, in political categories, but in ethical and moral categories - said the leader of Kukiz'15. - There is no option for me to indirectly support a government with a low-transparency member by voting. He is not backing down from that, he added.
2517	14	"I am not satisfied that Łukasz Mejza has suspended himself – emphasized Kukiz adding that Mejza actually went on vacation. ""You can't hang yourself, you can hang yourself,"" he sneered. - He is still de facto in the Ministry of Sport. I will not act hastily, I will wait until the end of the year, I will last until the end of the year – he announced."
2517	16	"To the point that this means that in the most important budget vote, PiS will not put pressure on Mejza, Kukiz replied that ""if the budget does not pass, the government collapses."" - And if the government falls, then the option that implements these laws of mine will fail. And those... I've asked them many times, there's absolutely no interest. The PSL kicked us out of the coalition, seized the money that was supposed to be spread for the promotion of direct democracy, and failed to fulfill other obligations. Who am I supposed to talk to? This leaves PiS for me – he added."
2517	18	"When asked if he could run in future elections from the lists of the United Right, Kukiz replied that he was able to run from any lists ""if it makes sense""."
25170	1	"Tusk thunders about the ""dream state"": PiS is like mercury"
25170	3	Not only the fish in the Oder are being killed, the entire country under Kaczyński is being killed. PiS is like mercury, wrote PO leader Donald Tusk on Twitter.
25170	5	"Tusk also referred to the ecological catastrophe on the Oder river on Thursday, during a meeting with the inhabitants of Jaktorów in Mazovia. He assessed that the situation related to the dying of fish and other animals in the Oder River is ""one of the biggest ecological scandals in recent years""."
25170	7	"As Donald Tusk added in Jaktorów, since July 26, when the first signals in this matter appeared, the rulers ""have not actually sent information to people that the water is poisoned."" - We are all a bit like those fish in the Odra River - he added."
25170	9	Territorials will help
25170	11	The head of the PO also reminded that information on this matter appeared in Lower Silesia already at the end of July. - On July 26, it was already known that the Oder River was threatened with an ecological disaster, already then hundreds of kilograms of dead fish were flowing on the Oder River. On August 3, there was already a parliamentary interpellation, one of the leaders of the Greens party, from our coalition, submitted (this) interpellation (...). Today we learn that Mr. Błaszczak sends soldiers there when the Oder River is actually poisoned throughout the course – he said.
25170	13	"On Thursday, the Minister of National Defense Mariusz Błaszczak announced on Twitter that soldiers would be sent to the Oder region. ""Territorials and operational troops will help in removing pollution on the river,"" Błaszczak wrote. ""They will also be ready to carry out other tasks"" - he added."
25170	15	"Late on Thursday evening, the rbb24 portal reported that employees of a laboratory in Berlin-Brandenburg found high concentrations of mercury in water samples. Fish plague in the Oder from Oława downwards has been observed since mid-July. Dead fish have also been observed, e.g. in the vicinity of Wrocław. The Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Wrocław also reported on Thursday that none of the samples taken from the Oder river in the Dolnośląskie Voivodship after August 1 did not contain mesitylene and that ""in all the samples tested, starting from July 28, the microscopic biological analysis showed the presence of organisms typical of the river measles""."
25172	1	"Morawiecki merciless. ""Measles as contaminated with mercury as Tusk with truthfulness"""
25172	3	Mateusz Morawiecki did not leave a dry thread on Donald Tusk. The bone of contention between the men this time turned out to be the ecological disaster on the Oder river. The Prime Minister, without mincing words, compared the contamination of the river to... the truthfulness of the PO leader.
25172	5	The whole country is living in a dramatic situation in the Odra River. So far, firefighters and anglers have fished out over 100 tons of dead fish from the river. Disturbing signals were observed for the first time at the end of July in Oława near Wrocław, and in mid-August the contaminated water reached Szczecin. Experts talk about a huge ecological catastrophe, after which the ecosystem will be reborn for years.
25172	7	Authorities have been trying for days to determine what caused the mass extinction of fish. Initially, the tests showed an increased level of oxygen and high salinity, then the media circulated sensational reports about the contamination of the Oder River with mercury. The presence of this element was to be demonstrated by tests carried out by the Germans, but later it turned out that it was a translation error, and the German services meant high pH in the water.
25172	9	Morawiecki without mercy about Tusk
25172	11	"Before this information was corrected, the news about the alleged mercury in the Polish river was picked up by the press, and the Polish authorities were thundered. For the failure to take quick steps in the matter of water contamination, the government scored m. Donald Tusk. ""Not only fish in the Oder are killed, the entire state under Kaczyński is killed"" and ""PiS is like mercury,"" he wrote on Twitter."
25172	13	"Now, for these words, the leader of the PO was hit by the prime minister. At Friday's conference in Smolajny (Warmia-Masuria Voivodeship), Mateusz Morawiecki reminded in a blunt and unambiguous way that ""some insinuated some contamination of the Oder with chemicals, contamination of the Oder with mercury."""
25172	15	So I wanted to say that the Oder River is as contaminated with chemicals, as contaminated with mercury, as Donald Tusk is contaminated with truthfulness, that is, in general - stated the head of the government bluntly.
25172	17	Recent research has allowed the prime minister to make such a firm judgment about the river. On the same day, Climate Minister Anna Moscow announced that water inspections had not revealed any illegal activities in the river. The government now blames the disaster on so far unidentified algae and high water salinity, which in turn may have been caused by the discharge of water from the mine.
25174	1	"Russians without work and residence permits. ""It's about national security"""
25174	3	Recall: we reported on refusals to Russian citizens in early August. Now we know more details.
25174	5	The information provided to us by the Pomeranian Voivodeship Office in Gdańsk shows that since February 24 (i.e. from the day when Russian troops illegally attacked Ukraine) 78 negative decisions have been issued for Russian citizens who applied for temporary residence or work.
25174	7	In total, 548 such applications were submitted from February to June 30. However, it is not known what status they currently have.
25174	9	It is possible that they are still being analyzed by officials. However, the scale of refusals may be even greater. This is evidenced by the legal basis referred to in the negative decisions already issued.
25174	11	As we were able to find out, Art. 100 sec. 1 point 4 of the Act of December 12, 2013 on foreigners. According to the wording of this provision:
25174	13	a foreigner is refused a temporary residence permit when it is required for reasons of state defense or security or the protection of public safety and order, or an obligation resulting from the provisions of ratified international agreements applicable to the Republic of Poland.
25174	15	Hundreds of Russians working in Pomerania
25174	17	At this point, it is worth noting that Russian citizens are one of the largest groups of foreigners employed in Pomerania.
25174	19	According to the latest ZUS data, among foreigners registered for social insurance in the branches in Gdańsk and Słupsk, Ukrainians predominate. At the end of March, there were over 42.5 thousand. This is an increase of over 2.5 thousand. compared to December 2021
25174	21	The second group is nearly 5,000. citizens of Belarus (an increase of 500 people).
25174	23	The top five was closed by the holders of passports: Georgia (1524), Russia (1203) and Moldova (1072).
25174	25	Europe is becoming more and more closed to Russia
25174	27	Meanwhile, we have unofficially heard that issuing decisions refusing work and stay to Russians is related to the recommendations of the Internal Security Agency.
25174	29	However, the actions of the Polish services should not come as a surprise, especially in the context of much stricter and official declarations of countries bordering Russia.
25174	31	The American Associated Press agency has recently reported on the demands of the leaders of Estonia and Finland. The authorities of these countries demand an end to issuing tourist visas to Russians.
25174	33	In their opinion, citizens of this country should not be able to spend their holidays in Europe, while the Russian government is waging war in Ukraine.
25174	35	In May, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that 3,668 civilians died in Ukraine from February 24 to May 15. 3,896 people were injured. There is also further evidence of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers.
25174	37	In turn, the Russian TASS news agency reported that, according to a survey conducted on 10-15 May on a sample of 1,600 adult citizens of Russia trust in Vladimir Putin is 81 percent. It should be noted, however, that the credibility of the pro-Kremlin poll and agency is relatively low.
25175	1	"Owsiak responds to Duda's words about the border. ""More nonsense comes from your mouth"""
25175	3	"Jurek Owsiak in his social media decided to refer to the words of Andrzej Duda, which the president uttered during his speech on the occasion of the Polish Army Day. ""Your words that such behavior is stupidity and treason are another nonsense that comes from your mouth"" - said the head of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity."
25175	5	Andrzej Duda, during his speech on the occasion of the Polish Army Day, referred to, among others, to the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border.
25175	7	"First of all, the president thanked the soldiers who defend the border against migrants. ""Thanks to the attitude of Polish soldiers and officers, thanks to your attitude, we showed this determination to the whole world, defending the Polish border, defending the border of the European Union, defending the border of the Schengen zone,"" said Andrzej Duda. ""Despite various types of attacks, various fools and traitors, various irresponsible people, the Polish soldier rose to the occasion and endured,"" he added."
25175	9	Owsiak about helping migrants
25175	11	"Apparently, Andrzej Duda's words offended Jurek Owsiak, who decided to refer to them on his Facebook profile. ""Mr. President. Once again you have given a signal from the planet where you live - but it is far from Poland and Poles who have their simple, clear and civic code of conduct!"" he began."
25175	13	"Owsiak reminded that for over three years his foundation has been teaching ""small children and young people the principles of first aid - nearly three million people have completed our courses with the exam they submitted"". ""The basic principle of our courses is the principle of the Good Samaritan, which tells us to help a person in need, and the same principle may lead to legal consequences for us who do not provide this help"" - he continued."
25175	15	"He mentioned that volunteers had opened a humanitarian point in Michałów on the Polish-Belarusian border. ""We have seen how many people of good will help exhausted and exhausted people. Not everyone survived those terrible days and to this day people on this piece of land suffer,"" wrote Owsiak."
25175	17	Owsiak to Duda: more nonsense coming from your mouth
25175	19	"The head of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity later did not hide the fact that Duda's words upset him. He accused the president that his words were ""bullshit""."

""We will continue to help whenever there is a need, and we do it according to the principle of a good Samaritan, and your thinking and actions, which I am often ashamed of, will never stop me and my friends from honest and humane actions above all religions and colors"" ."
25175	23	With great optimism in my heart, I read a lot of comments on your words, which, like me, do not agree with them and show us Poles as people who will always help their neighbors in extreme situations! Owsiak concluded.
25177	1	Elections in Italy: far-right leader Giorgia Meloni on the wave of support
25177	3	Italian politician Georgia Meloni is riding a wave of support that could see her become the country's first female prime minister and the first far-right leader since World War II.
25177	5	Although her Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots and promotes a message of Christianity, patriotism, motherhood and traditional family values, Meloni tries to allay concerns about her legacy by saying voters are tired of such discussions.
25177	7	Still, there are nagging signs that such a legacy is not so easily torn down: her party's symbol features the image of a tricolor flame, borrowed from a neo-fascist party formed shortly after the end of the war.
25177	9	If the Brothers of Italy win the elections on September 25 and Meloni, 45, becomes prime minister, it will be almost 100 years since Benito Mussolini, Italy's fascist dictator, came to power in October 1922.
25177	11	Meloni proudly introduced Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, the great-grandson of the dictator, as one of her candidates for the European Parliament in 2019, although he ultimately lost.
25177	13	"For the majority of Italian voters, questions about anti-fascism and neo-fascism are not ""a key driver to vote for,"" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of poll company YouTrend. “They don't see it as part of the present. They see it as part of the past."""
25177	15	Also read: Analysis: Losing is a victory for the far right in the French elections
25177	17	Still, Meloni is sensitive to international scrutiny regarding her possible launch and prefers the term conservative to far-right to describe her party.
25177	19	"She recently recorded video messages in English, French and Spanish, which stated that the Italian right ""has been transmitting fascism to history for decades, unequivocally condemning the suppression of democracy and shameful anti-Jewish laws."""
25177	21	This was a reference to a 1938 law prohibiting the small Italian Jewish community from participating in business, education and other aspects of daily life. The regulations paved the way for many Italian Jews to be deported to Nazi extermination camps during the German occupation of Rome at the end of World War II.
25177	23	"Yet by keeping the tricolor flame in his party's logo, he is ""symbolically playing with that legacy,"" said David Art, a professor of political science at Tufts University who studies Europe's far-right. ""But then he wants to say, 'We'. you're not racist."""
25177	25	Who is Giorgia Meloni?
25177	27	"She apologized for the ""tone"" but not the content of the horrific speech she gave in June in Spain to rally support for the far-right Vox party."
25177	29	"“They will say we are dangerous, extremists, racists, fascists, deniers and homophobes,” thundered Meloni, apparently referring to Holocaust deniers. She ended the crescendo of shouted slogans: ""Yes to natural families! No to the LGBT lobby! Yes to sexual identity! No to gender ideology!”"
25177	31	"Meloni slammed 'Brussels bureaucrats' and 'climate fundamentalism'. Meloni, who has a young daughter, claimed the ""most censored"" phrase was ""woman and motherhood""."
25177	33	Abortion did not come up as a campaign issue in Italy, where it is legal. But Meloni denounced Italy's declining birth rate, which would have been even lower had migrant women not given birth.
25177	35	"At a rally of right-wing supporters in Rome in 2019, Meloni elicited a roar of approval by shouting in a staccato tempo, ""I'm Giorgia! I'm a woman. I am the mother. I am Italian and I am a Christian. And you can't take that away from me!"""
25177	37	Within days, her proclamation became fodder for the lyrics of a rap song. While some saw it as a parody, Meloni loved it and even sang a few bars on a state radio show.
25177	39	According to her 2021 memoir I Am Giorgia, much of her identity was shaped by growing up in the working-class Garbatella neighborhood of Rome.
25177	41	At the age of 15, she joined the youth branch of the Italian Social Movement, a neo-fascist party with a flame symbol and political posters in the capital.
25177	43	When she was 31, Berlusconi appointed her youth minister in his third and final government. However, she soon made her own way, co-founding Brothers of Italy in 2012.
25177	45	Both Salvini and Meloni claim to protect what they call Europe's Christian identity. Salvini kisses hanging rosaries and wears a large cross on her often exposed breast, while Meloni's tiny cross sometimes peeks out from under her baggy blouses.
25177	47	Her party staunchly backed Draghi's moves to send arms to Ukraine, even though Salvini and Berlusconi, open admirers of Russian President Vladimir Putin, offered only lukewarm support. Meloni also defends the NATO alliance anchored by the United States, a Group of Seven country. However, he often sees European Union regulations as a violation of Italy's sovereignty.
25177	49	"If far-right Meloni forces dominate Italy's next government, there is concern over Italy's support for right-wing governments in Hungary and Poland ""for their deeply conservative agendas"" amid fears of ""democratic backsliding"" in the EU, said Art."
25177	51	"For his part, Meloni says he will ""stand fiercely against any anti-democratic drift."""
25177	53	What is behind the creation of the Brothers of Italy party?
25177	55	Just five years ago, the Italian Brothers – a name inspired by the opening words of the national anthem – were seen as a marginal force, garnering 4.4% of the vote. Currently, polls indicate that in September she may take first place with as much as 24% of the vote, just ahead of the centre-left Democratic Party led by former prime minister Enrico Letta.
25177	57	In Italy's complex semi-proportional electoral system, electoral coalitions are what get party leaders to the prime minister, not just votes. Right-wing politicians have done a much better job this year than Democrats at building wide-ranging electoral partnerships.
25177	59	Meloni allied herself with the right-wing League party led by Matteo Salvini, who, like her, favors cracking down on illegal migration. Her other electoral ally is the centre-right Forza Italia party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
25177	61	Last year, her party was the only one to refuse to join Italy's national pandemic unity coalition led by Prime Minister Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank. Draghi's government collapsed last month, suddenly abandoned by Salvini, Berlusconi and 5-Star leader Giuseppe Conte, all preoccupied with their parties' falling fortunes in the polls and local elections.
25177	63	"In opinion polls, Meloni is ""credited with a consistent and coherent approach to politics. She has not compromised,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco of YouTrend, adding that she is also seen as “a leader who has clear ideas – obviously not everyone agrees with them.”"
25178	1	"How a disgraced billionaire intends to ""make everyone happy"". Silvio Berlusconi returns to the political salons"
25178	3	The 85-year-old former Italian prime minister has a chance to become the main player in the upcoming elections. This could give him another five years of political clout. The career of Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire, real estate tycoon, media magnate and three-time prime minister of Italy, has been going on for decades, but recently his popularity has waned significantly.
25178	5	Berlusconi is sick. Nevertheless, he still does not let himself be forgotten. Rather, he appears at party events via video link. Moreover, after being convicted of tax fraud, he was banned from holding public office in Italy for four years.
25178	7	"However, now that he is 85 and most people his age are rather reclining on the sofa, the former Italian prime minister has decided to run for election. ""This way everyone will be happy,"" he told the radio with his unmistakable confidence."
25178	9	Barring a miracle, the elections on September 25 will see a triumph for the right-wing coalition, with Berlusconi as the top playmaker, giving him influence for the next five years.
25178	11	"The return is the result of his sense of ""duty,"" POLITICO said in written responses to our inquiries. Italy needs the values ​​that only his party represents to improve the economy, he said. ""My parents taught me that when I feel a strong sense of duty, I have to find the courage to do it."""
25178	13	Wanka-rising
25178	15	Although he dominated Italian politics and the media for more than two decades, until recently Berlusconi's political career seemed to be behind him.
25178	17	His image was tarnished by the so-called the bunga bunga affair, in which witnesses described orgies in his sumptuous villa near Milan. In 2011, the mounting national debt crisis and fears that Italy might default forced him to hand over power to technocrat Mario Monti. He faced numerous accusations until he was finally removed from the Senate after being convicted of tax fraud in 2013.
25178	19	However, the unexpected outbreak of nationalist populism in the last decade has given Berlusconi a chance to reinvent himself as a responsible, pro-EU, moderate politician. He was elected to the European Parliament in 2019, but rarely votes.
25178	21	Last year, his rehabilitation seemed complete as he joined a grand coalition led by former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, a mainstay of European institutions.
25178	23	"Last month, apparently sensing a change in political winds, he joined other coalition partners in withdrawing support for Draghi's government, forcing a snap election that the right wing has a chance of winning. Three of his government's ministers have resigned from Forza Italia, saying he is ""irresponsible"" and puts party interests before the good of the country."
25178	25	"Berlusconi denies any responsibility for the fall of the government, claiming that ""we would have preferred that the Draghi government lasted to the natural end of the term with the elections in 2023. This was not possible due to the irresponsible behavior of the 5 Stars and the ambiguous maneuvers of the Democrats. Therefore, there was no other solution, as soon as you turn to the citizens."""
25178	27	A weaker partner, but not that weak
25178	29	Support for Berlusconi, a minor partner in a right-wing alliance with Giorgia Meloni's hard-right Italian Brothers and Matteo Salvini's anti-immigration League, is much less than it was in its heyday in 2008, when his party won 37 percent of the vote. in the election. Currently, its shares fluctuate around 8 percent. However, together, right-wing parties are expected to get around 45 percent of the vote. votes, which should be enough to obtain a majority in parliament.
25178	31	However, the right needs to convince not only Italian voters, but also international investors, rating agencies, European governments and institutions that fear that the most right-wing government in Italy's post-war history could be a threat to Italy's democracy and alliances in the EU and NATO.
25178	33	Unless international institutions are convinced that heavily indebted Italy is in safe hands, the cost of borrowing will skyrocket and the government's room for maneuver will be severely limited.
25178	35	Putin's turnaround
25178	37	One of the reasons for these fears was the warm relations of some members of the alliance with far-right parties in other countries, such as Spain's Vox, as well as with autocrats such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
25178	39	The League signed a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party in 2017, and Salvini tried to carry out a peacekeeping mission in Moscow earlier this year, but it emerged that the Russian embassy paid for it. Berlusconi himself enjoyed a long friendship with Putin and even spent holidays at his dacha, and was now forced to deny media reports that he had been in contact with the Russian ambassador in Rome and sympathized with Russia's position.
25178	41	"So far, his criticism of Putin's invasion of Ukraine has been toned down. But in a statement to POLITICO, Berlusconi unequivocally condemned his former friend: ""Today Russia, by attacking Ukraine, has violated international law and brought a painful war to the heart of Europe."""
25178	43	"Recalling his time as prime minister, Berlusconi says he only worked to improve relations between Russia and the West. The 2002 NATO-Russia agreement in Rome ""could have been the beginning of an era in which Russia became a partner and a trusted interlocutor."" He said he was ""deeply disappointed"" with Putin."
25178	45	"Berlusconi denied that any party in the right-wing alliance is extremist in nature, claiming that the coalition is centre-right and added that it had ""nothing to do with extremist movements in other countries."""
25178	47	"We are pro-European, pro-Western, pro-NATO, with liberal democracy as our only point of reference, Berlusconi wrote and added that he ""would not participate in any government"" if he was not absolutely sure of its ""democratic correctness, sense of responsibility and loyalty to Europe and the West."""
25178	49	According to Berlusconi, it is the loyalty of the centre-left that is in doubt because their coalition includes a far-left party that voted against Sweden and Finland joining NATO.
25178	51	Berlusconi's Second Life
25178	53	Despite being less popular today, Berlusconi still manages to cause a stir. Last week, during the discussion of the proposed reform of the presidential system, he suggested that President Sergio Mattarella would have to resign if the reform passed.
25178	55	This statement was perceived as an attack on Mattarella, the guarantor of Italy's democratic balance and the country's most popular politician. Berlusconi's opponents accused the right of conspiring to dismantle Italy's democratic system and said Berlusconi wanted the role for himself. Berlusconi has denied that he wants to become president.
25178	57	Berlusconi could aspire to Italy's second-highest office, president of the senate, but that would be a highly controversial choice, and his allies have so far not backed him.
25178	59	Insiders say the election campaign revived him. His campaign, based on videos posted on Facebook, uses nostalgia for the 1990s and proven promises of tax cuts and pension increases.
25178	61	Even without formal office, as long as he gets the votes he expects, Berlusconi will have considerable influence in the next government.
25178	63	– If he gets 7 to 8 percent. votes, as we expect, it could mean the difference between a clear victory for the right and a deadlock, said Daniele Albertazzi, a professor of politics at the University of Surrey. “It would be crucial to the coalition's survival. And it can be assumed that it will make its allies feel it.
25178	65	Ideologically, there is broad agreement among the right-wing alliance on the electoral agenda of tax cuts and immigration restrictions, and the far-right parties seem reluctant to give in to their more extremist supporters.
25178	67	However, Berlusconi can draw many red lines if he wants to. Forza Italia's position at the center means that it is the only party that can theoretically move to support a left-wing or technocratic government without paying a high price to voters.
25178	69	"""He's essential."" Many games can be played in the center,” said Albertazzi. “It may remain valid for another five years."
25179	1	"""Teflon Mark"" the longest-serving Prime Minister in the history of the Netherlands. Who is Mark Rutte?"
25179	3	He was supposed to stop the extreme right in the form of the dangerous Geert Wilders. And he did it. By the way, unfortunately, he took over some of the opponent's anti-immigrant rhetoric. During his tenure, all attempts to reform the EU were blocked by the Netherlands.
25179	5	Financial crisis, refugee crisis, pandemic crisis and finally the crisis caused by the war in Ukraine - the Netherlands has faced many challenges over the past 12 years, but each time with the same man at the helm. Rutte's political longevity is something unique in Western Europe, but dark clouds are gathering over the head of government in The Hague, and it is not known whether he will be able to dispel them this time as well.
25179	7	It is 2010. Barack Obama has only recently become president, Nicholas Sarkozy is in power in France, Silvio Berlusconi is prime minister in Italy, and Donald Tusk's government is in its first term in Poland. In the Netherlands – then called the Netherlands – the elections were won by the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD for short), and its chairman, Mark Rutte, became the head of government.
25179	9	"At the beginning of August, exactly 4,310 days had passed since Rutte was sworn in, which set a record for the length of time he held the office of prime minister. Previously, it belonged to the Christian Democrat Ruud Lubbers, who ruled the country between 1982 and 1994. As prime minister, Rutte survived three national elections, more than a hundred parliamentary attempts to remove him from office, and several political crises. All this made the Dutch nickname ""Teflon Mark"" - no dirt sticks to it. Among the leaders of the European Union, only Viktor Orban accompanied him at the beginning of his first term. The authoritarian Hungarian is not going anywhere, what about Rutt?"
25179	11	Hot water in the tap and a bicycle in the garage
25179	13	The head of the Dutch government does not owe his 12 years in office to his charisma or to captivating the Dutch with ambitious visions. As he once said, paraphrasing Helmut Schmidt, if someone is looking for vision, they should go to an ophthalmologist, not him. The leader of the VVD proposes peace, stability and hot tap water instead. And that down-to-earthness apparently appeals to voters. A lot has changed in Dutch politics over the last dozen or so years, but not the prime minister. He may not be captivating, but he seems to manage the state efficiently.
25179	15	The image of a modest manager matches his everyday life - Rutte is known for commuting to work by bike, he has an old car and a small house. He also carefully observes the law: at a time when many politicians are drowned in scandals related to breaking the covid restrictions, Rutte did not visit his dying mother in the hospital, because it would be inconsistent with the restrictions in force at the time. By the way, very controversial and causing fierce protests, so the hypocrisy of the rulers would not get away with them. Teflon Marek stayed clean.
25179	17	However, it must not be forgotten that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands is also an exceptionally skillful politician, able to maneuver between different political options and make difficult compromises. These skills are essential in a country where the actual electoral threshold is 0.67%. and there are usually ten or more parties in parliament, so almost every government requires a coalition of at least a few of them. During Rutte's tenure, the VVD had more than 40 deputies in the 150-seat House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer) only once. In order to stay in power, the prime minister entered into various coalitions, which was why he was sometimes called a chameleon.
25179	19	Rutte's partners - from national populists to social democrats
25179	21	The leader of the VVD has long been treated as a barrier against the extreme right, so it is rarely remembered that it was with its help that he became prime minister for the first time. In 2010, the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders gave Rutt and his Christian Democrat coalition support, which lasted until 2012, when early elections were held as a result of the lack of a parliamentary majority for the policy of budget cuts. The next partner of the VVD was the social democratic Labor Party (PvdA), so the government took a more centrist direction.
25179	23	"In the next elections in 2017, Rutte was already a guarantor of stability and a pro-European liberal whose goal is to stop the dangerous Wilders. And he did, but by adopting anti-immigrant rhetoric himself, along with many of the demands of the extreme right. Let us add that Rutte's ""pro-Europeanism"" boils down to defending its neoliberal and technocratic shape, and during his term of office all attempts to reform the EU were inhibited by the Netherlands, which has recently become evident when the EU is planning a post-pandemic recovery fund. From the beginning, Rutte was one of the biggest supporters of austerity and also opposed overly ambitious plans in discussions on EU budgets."
25179	25	After the elections in 2017 and 2021, centre-right government coalitions were formed, consisting of the same parties: VVD, Social Liberal Democrats 66 and two Christian Democrat groups (CDA and CU). In both cases, reaching an agreement was not easy, but Rutte proved his flexibility and ability to build a cross-party compromise. And despite the emergence of various candidates for prime minister, none was able to assemble an alternative coalition.
25179	27	Fatigue, angry farmers, political rival - what will defeat Rutte?
25179	29	After twelve years in office, it is difficult to maintain the initial enthusiasm, and critics increasingly point to Rutt's visible fatigue. He himself denies it, but while his rivals once compared him to Duracell's bunny due to his energy and diligence, now even VVD activists unofficially mention the prime minister's burnout and the need to find a successor. Circumstances are not kind to Rutte, as he recently had to deal with large protests against the Covid restrictions, and now cities and roads are blocked by angry farmers' tractors.
25179	31	Despite its small size, the Netherlands is the continent's largest exporter of meat. Keeping many millions of cattle and other animals, however, has huge environmental costs and due to pollution, the government has announced a plan to reduce livestock by 50%. by 2030. This naturally outraged the farmers and sparked their protests. This is not the only problem of the Dutch – Rutte provided hot tap water, but did little to solve the country's structural problems. For multinational corporations, the Netherlands is a tax haven, but citizens have experienced cuts in social benefits in the last dozen or so years. The housing crisis is ongoing and in the face of state inaction, local authorities are trying to fight it. Finally, there is the climate catastrophe, which is particularly dangerous for a country whose large part is located in a depression.
25179	33	The weakness of the opposition speaks in favor of Rutte. It is true that the Farmer-Civic Movement (BBB) ​​gains support on the wave of protests, but this is probably a temporary phenomenon. Labor, on the other hand, has not been able to pull itself together since entering into a coalition with the VVD. There is talk of a possible merger of the PvdA with the Green Left, but although according to polls such a left-wing coalition could even fight for an election victory, there are no specifics so far. The Socialist Party, in turn, the last of the main progressive parties, is mired in internal disputes between more and less radical activists, which is why the electorate is slowly fleeing from it. On the other side of the political scene, on the far right, there is a rivalry between several parties, and even the strongest of them cannot currently threaten the VVD.
25179	35	The Christian Democrat CDA is also in crisis, but if you are looking for someone who would end Rutte's dominance in politics, it could be former politician of this party, Pieter Omtzigt. It brought down the government shortly before the last election, revealing that the Dutch tax office, very lenient on corporations, unjustly deprived tens of thousands of parents of child benefits - many of whom were additionally faced with gigantic fines for alleged fraud. Rutte survived the scandal, but it was one of the biggest blows he received in his political career. Omtzigt, on the other hand, quickly became one of the most popular politicians in the Netherlands, so it is speculated that he may deprive Teflon Mark of another term in the next election, unless Rutte himself decides to retire early.
25180	1	"The ""weak spot"" of the main variants of the coronavirus has been discovered"
25180	3	Researchers have discovered an important vulnerability in all major variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the recently developed Omicron subvariants. 'Now that we have been able to describe their structure in detail, completely new treatment options have opened up for us,' the researchers say. In the publication, they also explain why antibody therapy for COVID-19 was not effective at key moments.
25180	5	The detected weakness could potentially be exploited by neutralizing antibodies, paving the way for therapies that would be effective against all variants of the coronavirus, underline researchers from the University of British Columbia.
25180	7	The team led by Dr. Srirama Subramaniama used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal at the atomic level the structure of a vulnerable spot on the virus spike protein. This fragment is called an epitope. At the same time, scientists described the VH Ab6 antibody, a fragment of which is able to attach to the epitope of the virus and completely neutralize it.
25180	10	The virus adapts quickly
25180	12	"""SARS-CoV-2 is a highly adaptable virus that has evolved to avoid most existing antibody therapies, as well as much of the immunity provided by vaccines and natural infection,"" says Dr. Subramaniam. - Our study reveals its weak point, which is largely unchanged in all variants and can be easily neutralized by the antibody fragment."
25180	14	- This is a good ground for designing a variety of therapies and treatments that can potentially help many at-risk people - he emphasizes.
25180	16	Antibodies are molecules naturally produced by our body to fight infection, but they can also be produced in a laboratory and later administered to patients. While several antibody therapies have already been developed for COVID-19, their effectiveness has always fallen sharply in the face of new, highly mutated variants such as Omicron.
25180	18	How do antibodies work?
25180	20	"- Antibodies attach to the virus in a very specific way; they fit like a key to a lock. So when the virus mutates, the key doesn't match anymore,"" Subramaniam explains. - So we were looking for master keys. Such antibodies that neutralize the virus even after extensive mutations."
25180	22	Such a universal key identified in the described study turned out to be a fragment of the VH Ab6 antibody. Experiments have confirmed its effectiveness against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, Epsilon and Omicron variants. The fragment neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by attaching to an epitope on the spike protein and blocking the virus from entering human cells.
25180	24	- The epitope we describe in this publication is not included in the so-called hotspots of mutations, therefore it is preserved in a very similar or unchanged form in different variants - says the author of the study. 'Now that we have been able to describe its structure in detail, completely new treatment options have opened up.
25180	26	"According to Dr. Subramaniama, this specific ""Achilles heel"" of the virus, can be used by drug manufacturers not only to create effective measures against the currently dominant variants, but also those that will appear in some time."
25180	28	"- We have obtained a full picture of this sensitive place. We know every interaction that a spike protein can have with an antibody in this region. So we can develop a myriad of different antibody therapies,"" Subramaniam concludes."
25180	30	- And having widely effective, acting on different variants of drugs, would completely change the rules of the game in the ongoing pandemic - he announces.
25182	1	There is no climate threat
25182	3	This is what the World Climate Declaration, the content of which was published on 18.08. 2022. It has been signed by over 1,100 scientists from around the world, including several Nobel Prize winners.
25182	5	Comments that have appeared around the world on this subject range from enthusiasm to skeptical assessment of the possibility of its practical use.
25182	7	"The former argue that the existing political fiction that humans are causing most or all of climate change, and the claim that the science behind the notion is ""fixed"", was dealt a brutal blow with the publication of the ""World Climate Declaration (WCD)"" signed by over 1,100 scientists and professionals."
25182	9	There is no climate crisis, say the authors, who come from all over the world and made this declaration under the guidance of the Norwegian Nobel laureate in physics, Professor Ivar Giaever. This declaration claims that climate science has evolved into a belief-based discussion rather than sound self-critical science.
25182	11	Commentators of this report cite its findings that we should free ourselves from the naive belief in immature climate models, and that future climate research must place much more emphasis on empirical science. The gap between the real world and the modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change,
25182	13	The declaration further states that Earth's climate has varied since the planet has existed, with natural periods of cold and warm. No wonder we are experiencing a period of warming. It is said that climate models have many shortcomings and are not at all credible as tools of global policy.
25182	15	These models blow up the effects of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide but ignore any beneficial effects. This report states that CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential for all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is good for nature, greening the Earth; the extra CO2 in the air supports the growth of the world's plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing crop yields and providing more food.
25182	17	These are only selected fragments of this declaration, which demolishes the entire edifice of the theory of climate warming. Skeptics note that while this declaration is a major event, it will be ignored by the mainstream media. But this isn't the first time eminent scientists have called for more realism in climate science. Of course, green extremists in academia, politics, and journalism will continue to argue for the desirable implementation of Net Zero policies.
25183	1	"Putin will take advantage of Dugina's death? ""Kremlin can stimulate its society"""
25183	3	After the death of Daria Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ideologue, experts are convinced that Russian propaganda will use the mysterious event to fuel anti-Ukrainian sentiment and interest in the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the Kremlin will not be interested in mythologizing Alexander Dugin and his ultranationalist views. – The continuation of the internal game of the services in the Kremlin awaits us. First, they will take advantage of the attack, and then they will pass over it on the agenda, experts tell us.
25183	5	Recall that on Saturday evening, Daria Dugina, the daughter of Alexander Dugin, one of the Kremlin's main ideologues, a supporter of Russian imperialism and the invasion of Ukraine, died in a car explosion on the highway near Moscow. Dugin was supposed to drive the car, but at the last moment he switched to another vehicle. According to the Russian security service (FSB), the attack was organized and carried out by a citizen of Ukraine. However, it soon turned out that the evidence of her guilt had been fabricated. And the Ukrainian authorities firmly distanced themselves from the incident.
25183	8	"At the same time, according to the independent portal Meduza, interest in the war is declining in Russia. Russians are starting to get tired of topics related to the ""special operation"" in Ukraine."
25183	10	"According to the portal, this is also confirmed by the results of research conducted by the private holding company Romir. ""These show that the viewership of the most important federal channels has fallen by at least eight percent. Most of the airtime on Russian television is now occupied by political talk shows, in which the hosts and participants talk about Ukraine and ""hostile countries of the West,"" the analysis reads."
25183	12	The Kremlin will stimulate society
25183	14	Will Russian propaganda use the assassination of the Russian ideologue's daughter to renew interest in the war? Will it build the myth of Dugin on the basis of a mysterious event? According to experts interviewed by Wirtualna Polska, due to internal power struggles in the Kremlin, the topic of the attack will be short-lived.
25183	16	- It seems that the Russian society is really starting to get tired of information about the war in Ukraine. The Russians are no longer reacting to the events at the front, to the same extent as at the beginning of the conflict, Michał Marek, an expert on disinformation in Russia, president of the Center for Research on the Contemporary Security Environment Foundation, tells Wirtualna Polska.
25183	18	"As he emphasizes, that is why ""any event that can stimulate emotions in connection with the war is beneficial from the Kremlin's perspective."" - The murder of Daria Dugina will probably play such a role now. But in the long term, also in the ""mythical"" perspective, the issue of the assassination will not affect the mood of the Russians. They will move on to everyday matters and the subject will be forgotten, he adds."
25183	20	And as he emphasizes, Russian propaganda centers use the attack for one purpose. - To fuel anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western sentiments. The leading narrative is blaming Ukraine, but there is also the theme of the responsibility of the Western services. Like a mantra, the slogan that this is a war between Russia and NATO is repeated. Thus, the Kremlin builds continuous support for further actions in Ukraine, assesses Michał Marek.
25183	22	Professor Daniel Boćkowski from the Department of International Security at the University of Bialystok speaks in a similar tone. - After the coup, the Kremlin can stimulate the public to become interested in the war again. Russian propagandists are good at it, but they are also painfully predictable. Although Dugin is a pro-Kremlin ideologue, it was his daughter who was more popular in Russia. She appeared very often in propaganda materials, inciting hatred towards the West and Ukraine. She was identified with the system. The Kremlin may want to take advantage of this, Prof. Daniel Bockowski.
25183	24	Dugin is not a guru in Russia
25183	26	"In his opinion, the attack on Dugina ""does not resonate much"" in Russia itself. - Maybe only among ultranationalists who call for retaliation in Ukraine. The Kremlin will not mythologize Dugin's daughter, because Dugin himself would become mythical. She was a reflection of his ideology. Ultranationalism is good in Russia for extremely pro-war politicians and businessmen who profit from the conflict. But it does not have to be in the interest of oligarchs who have lost their fortunes, yachts and the ability to travel around the world - assesses prof. Daniel Bockowski."
25183	28	"As Professor Mark Galeotti, an author of books on Russia, wrote in a commentary for The Spectator weekly, although many in the West consider Dugin to be ""Putin's brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"", he is not, and has never been, particularly influential and has no personal ties to the Russian president."
25183	30	"In the opinion of the scientist, Dugin is one of a whole series of ""political entrepreneurs"" who are trying to present their plans and doctrines to the Kremlin."
25183	32	For a while, in 2014, he was on the rise, because his claims about the civilizational destiny of Russia and the status of a Eurasian nation were convenient when rationalizing the seizure of land in the Donbass. Later, however, Dugin was no longer useful, says Mark Galeotti.
25183	34	An ideologue convenient for the Kremlin
25183	36	According to prof. Daniel Boćkowski, Dugin functioned in the Russian political system thanks to the fact that he was paid by the Kremlin. - The system paid for Dugin, the authorities used him as a tool. His concepts, visions of the world, views - were sometimes less necessary, sometimes more. More so, it floated to the top. If less, he circulated in the environment of his ultranationalists and no one bothered him. And his daughter shone with reflected light, having no idea what to do, signing her philosophical analyzes with the pseudonym Daria Platonova - says WP prof. Daniel Bockowski.
25183	38	In the opinion of our interlocutor, internal struggles in Russia were behind the attack. - Certainly no Russian national army or Ukrainian services. But Putin didn't decide that either. We must stop ideologizing the Russian dictator. For the last 10 years, we have had a propaganda project in Russia that Putin is all-powerful. But it is not. It doesn't decide everything. Putin is not a god. Even if he wanted to, he's not even Stalin. It is part of the puzzle. We don't know if he made it himself or if others made it. Remember that war is business. In the conflict, some groups in Russia make business and others lose out. Here, I would be more interested in unraveling the mystery of the assassination attempt, believes Prof. Daniel Bockowski.
25183	40	In turn, Michał Marek from the Foundation Center for Research on the Contemporary Security Environment predicts that similar attacks - like the one on Dugina - may continue.
25183	42	- But not right away. The current event will be silenced, and later we may witness more similar outbreaks. The assassination attempt on Dugina could well have been the responsibility of the secret services as well as Kremlin factions. In the case of the murder of the Russian ideologue's daughter, the matter is very unclear. However, one inaccuracy should be noted. Initially, it was reported that a burnt body was found in the car. The photographs and recordings show that Dugina's body was outside the car, thrown onto the road. We can therefore assume that there was someone else in the car, which the Russian side does not inform. So the question is: was it Dugina who was the real target of the bombers... - wonders Michał Marek.
25184	1	Ziemkiewicz: The government once again allows itself to be made in bamboo
25184	3	"– Mrs. Von der Leyen sets the rules of the political system in Poland – assesses Rafał Ziemkiewicz, a columnist for ""Do Rzeczy""."
25184	5	In a recent interview with Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, Ursula von der Leyen assessed that the amendment to the law on the Supreme Court, which entered into force in mid-July, does not guarantee judges the possibility to question the status of other judges without the risk of being subject to disciplinary liability.
25184	7	– This issue should be resolved in order to meet the conditions for granting money from the National Recovery Plan (so-called milestones – ed.) and allow the Commission to launch the first payment – ​​she emphasized. And she added that Poland must also fully comply with the decision of the Court of Justice, which has not yet happened.
25184	9	"""In particular, suspended judges have not been reinstated and the daily financial penalty remains in place,"" the EC president said. Her statement is widely commented on in the media and the topic of the Polish KPO loan is constantly one of the dominant topics discussed by politicians and the media."
25184	11	Ziemkiewicz: The government allows itself to be made in bamboo
25184	13	– Mrs. Von der Leyen sets the political rules in Poland – said Rafał Ziemkiewicz in Telewizja Republika. Asked about the request of the European Commission to separate the functions of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice in Poland, the publicist stated that the solution itself can be discussed, but it is certainly not Brussels that should decide on the shape of the Polish justice system.
25184	15	– The organization of the judiciary in a given country is not something that the European Commission has the right to decide. The European treaties are pure waste paper, they are long behind us, no one cares about them, he said. – This is probably the fifth time that the government has let itself be made in bamboo. This repeats itself every time. How many times can you do that, he added.
25184	17	Ziemkiewicz believes that the European Commission is no longer only interested in replacing governments in Poland, but also in paralyzing the entire country. This is to lead to a demand which boils down to the fact that each judge will be able to challenge the verdict of another judge.
25184	19	"– It is as if a liberum veto was imposed on Poland. This demand for further changes in the judiciary is simply paralyzing the state. Any neptek can challenge the verdict and challenge the judge because he doesn't like it. The judge ""Lugansk"", which we have, can recognize a judge as ... a non-judge. If you paralyze Poland in this way, you become a judicial state within a state. Under the protectorate of the EU, i.e. Germany. Let me repeat, Luhansk is getting so legal – said the columnist of ""Do Rzeczy""."
25185	1	Texas knows what to do with illegal immigrants. Sends them back to New York and Washington
25185	3	"On Sunday, a second bus with immigrants who crossed the southern US border arrived in New York. Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, sent them from Texas, saying he was testing the commitment of the city, which has described itself as a ""sanctuary"" for these newcomers."
25185	5	Due to the crisis caused by the ideological rule of the Biden-Harris administration, the southern border of the United States is crossed by countless intruders, including those associated with Mexican drug cartels, criminals, dealers and people who are responsible for numerous crimes in America.
25185	7	While the left-wing authorities in Washington consistently refuse to solve this crisis and complete the border wall, most of which was built by Donald Trump, the conservative governor of Texas decided to test the pro-immigrant declarations of the Democratic Party rulers.
25185	9	"The second bus with immigrants arrived in New York on Sunday, where they were greeted in Manhattan by Mayor Eric Adams. A politician attacked Catholic governor Greg Abbott, claiming that he was ""using"" immigrants for political games."
25185	11	"On this occasion, the New York Post noted that Abbott had sent more than 6,100 migrants to Washington since April ""in response to the open border policy of the administration of Democratic US President Joe Biden, which is overwhelming the Texas community."""
25185	13	Local radio 1010 WINS noted that New York taxi drivers were transporting newly arrived asylum seekers free of charge to special shelters.
25187	1	President Andrzej Duda signed the law on carbon allowance
25187	3	President Andrzej Duda signed the law on the coal allowance, providing for the payment of PLN 3,000. PLN for each household heated with hard coal, the Chancellery of the President informed PAP on Thursday evening.
25187	5	Pursuant to the Act, in order to receive a coal allowance of PLN 3,000, PLN, you will have to submit an application for its payment to the municipality by November 30 this year. The municipality will, in turn, have a maximum of 30 days to pay it. The allowance will also be exempt from tax and seizure. The condition for receiving the carbon allowance will be the entry or notification of the heating source to the Central Register of Emissions of Buildings.
25187	7	The Act also provides that BGK will be able to take out loans and issue bonds on the domestic and foreign markets, the funds from which will be used to create a credit line for energy companies. This is to guarantee the continuity of heat supplies to consumers for residential or public utility purposes, in particular for the purchase and settlement of hard coal. The maximum loan amount is PLN 20 million.
25187	9	The new regulations provide that the maximum limit of spending on carbon additives will be PLN 11.5 billion, and the source of financing will be the COVID-19 Prevention Fund. The Act provides that the NBP will transfer part of its profit to this Fund, provided that it is higher than assumed in the Budget Act. According to the Ministry of Finance, about PLN9.5bn will come from the NBP. In addition, the act provides for PLN 2 billion for guarantees for the credit line that BGK is to create for heating companies.

25188	5	"Over 30 percent says ""definitely no"" to restrictions"
25188	7	"According to the survey, 33.5 percent. of respondents ""definitely not"" support a return to Covid restrictions; the answer ""rather yes"" was chosen by 27.6 percent. respondents; ""probably not"" - 20.6 percent people; 11.9% answered ""definitely yes"". surveyed. The answer ""I don't know / It's hard to say"" was chosen by 6.4 percent. respondents."
25188	9	It is mainly young people aged 18-29 who do not want to return to restrictions. This answer was given by 95% of respondents. survey participants from this group (72 percent - definitely not, 23 percent - probably not).
25188	11	Older people want it, young people don't
25188	13	This trend changes with the age of the respondents. 67 percent of people aged 60 to 69 want the government to reintroduce coronavirus restrictions (17 percent definitely yes, 50 percent - rather yes).
25188	15	The percentage of respondents who are in favor of the return of restrictions due to the epidemic in the case of people aged 70+ is lower and amounts to 58%. (15% - definitely yes, 43% - rather yes).
25188	17	PiS voters support the restrictions
25188	19	Law and Justice voters are the largest group that supports the return to restrictions. 66% agree with this idea. respondents (13 percent - definitely yes, 53 percent - rather yes). Respondents who vote for the Confederation have a different opinion. None of them supported the reintroduction of restrictions due to the growing number of coronavirus infections in Poland.
25188	21	The United Surveys survey was conducted on July 29-31 on a representative sample of 1,000 Poles using the CAWI method.
25189	1	Another wave of restrictions coming?
25189	3	"At the end of July, the Minister of Health, Adam Niedzielski, stated that he expected the peak of the summer wave of the Covid-19 epidemic in ""around mid-August"". In this context, announcements of the restoration of sanitary rigors, which were lifted only a few months ago, appear more and more often in the media."
25189	5	These forecasts arouse a lot of fear and anxiety in society. In 2021, Poland took the infamous first place in the number of excess deaths in Europe. Our lawyers know perfectly well what dramas Polish families faced at that time. To this day, we represent the family of a man who died of a heart attack before the law enforcement authorities, because health professionals misinterpreted the symptoms of the heart attack as symptoms of Covid-19 and did not provide him with the necessary help on time, showing a lot of contempt and indifference to the patient and his family.
25189	7	We also defend a physiotherapist who was dismissed from the hospital only because he refused to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and a doctor who will be held accountable before a medical disciplinary court for signing an open letter of doctors calling for a thorough scientific debate on the strategy to fight the pandemic.
25189	9	A number of actions taken and planned by Ordo Iuris are aimed at ensuring that reactions to this and other diseases are rational and based on a reliable scientific debate, not on emotions, censoring the public debate and uncritically following the recommendations of international bodies such as WHO and EU institutions .
25189	11	Together with a team of experts, since autumn last year, we have been working on the most comprehensive scientific monograph in Poland on the legal, medical and economic effects of sanitary restrictions during the pandemic period. The completion of the work and the publication of the book perfectly fits the moment when epidemic regulations are being reconsidered.
25189	13	It's time to replace emotions with a reliable and scientific approach that will allow for an effective and rational response to the next wave of coronavirus infections, combining care for the health of Poles with respect for their rights and freedoms and awareness of the economic consequences of decisions made.
25189	15	"A post-conference publication from the symposium ""Faces of a pandemic"" organized at the Academy of Social and Media Culture in Toruń will also be published soon. The document will include an article in which we clearly demonstrated that the fight against Covid-19 transmission must not lead to a deterioration of medical care for patients suffering from other diseases."
25189	17	We are also developing a bill that will guarantee the constitutional rights of believers, preventing the rulers from closing churches again as part of pandemic restrictions. The project will ensure the strengthening of rights and freedoms, confirming clear criteria for assessing pandemic restrictions.
25189	19	From the first days of the pandemic, Ordo Iuris lawyers have been helping everyone affected by complicated problems during the pandemic period with prudence and delicacy. Advice, legal interventions, further guides for parishes, chaplains, entrepreneurs, medics. Always with an emphasis on the necessary rationality of the actions of the state and its services. Today is the time for systemic initiatives that summarize this period and draw conclusions for the future. Thanks to the involvement of our experts and donors, we can help build a system that is resistant to emotions and panic - based on a rational, realistic assessment of threats. Although this means costs, we know that no one but us will take on this case.
2519	2	"The ""Vaccination Makes You Free"" banner is not an accident at work. Yes, the Confederation is playing with the epidemic"
2519	4	A banner referring to the Auschwitz camp has been one of the favorite accessories of anti-vaccine activists from Grzegorz Braun's circle for months. Other Confederates claim that they are not anti-vaxxers, but they take advantage of social aversion to vaccination and restrictions with pleasure
2519	6	"On Tuesday, December 14, 2021, a demonstration ""against forced vaccination, Covid passports and unlawful restrictions"" was held in front of the Sejm, organized by the Confederation and anti-vaxxers. This was not the first far-right rally of its kind - they are held in the same place quite regularly. This time the meeting gained publicity thanks to the banner ""Vaccination makes you free"" stylized as ""Arbeit macht frei""."
2519	8	Spontaneously and accidentally?
2519	10	The banner was sharply criticized by the Auschwitz Museum as well as government and opposition politicians, which made the Confederates distance themselves from the performance in front of the Sejm.
2519	12	“This banner should not appear at our demonstration. That's true. As the organizers realized, they asked the owners of this banner. My great-grandfather was also in a concentration camp, so I'm not very amused by such happenings,” Michał Ubraniak commented on Twitter. Artur Dziambor spoke in a similar tone in an interview with Rzeczpospolita:
2519	14	“The situation was very simple. We organized the picket, this photo was taken before. The man who held this banner was asked to leave the front of the event. On the other hand, the fact that someone appeared with such a banner, invited to such a picket, is perhaps an emotion that is awakened in the crowd by the segregation policy.
2519	16	"However, the available recordings show that the politicians spoke for a long time against the background of the inscription, posing for photos next to it. The banner did not appear out of nowhere - it was brought by a group of anti-vaccine activists Justyna Socha, head of the ""STOP NOP"" association, a former candidate of the Confederation to the European Parliament, and above all - Grzegorz Braun's social assistant."
2519	18	"They became famous for the first time in December 2020, when a march of people dressed in camp striped uniforms walked through the streets of Łódź. At that time, they also carried a banner ""Vaccination makes you free"". The organizer of the assembly was Piotr Jawornik, also a social assistant of Grzegorz Braun."
2519	20	"Nuremberg 2.0 or ""you will hang"""
2519	22	"Grzegorz Braun himself is a staunch anti-vaxxer and a promoter of historical analogies. ""Nuremberg 2.0"" - another of the banners that appeared on Tuesday in front of the Sejm - is his own program of documenting the ""genocide"" practiced by Niedzielski, Dworczyk, Morawiecki and their subordinate services and state authorities. For months, Braun has been traveling all over Poland and telling conspiracy theories about the epidemic at rallies and promising to hold the ruling elites accountable."
2519	24	These are people who have committed numerous crimes against the health, life, property of Poles, security and defense of the Polish State in the last two years. They are criminals in the criminal sense, people who have on their conscience cases and deaths attributed to the fashionable and overrated plague this season,” Braun said on August 2 in Jasło. And he reminded that in Nuremberg criminals were sent to the scaffold.
2519	26	"On September 16, from the Sejm rostrum, he directly announced to Minister Niedzielski that he would be hanged, for which he was financially punished. Soon after, he launched a fundraiser on the zrzutka.pl portal for the ""Nuremberg 2.0"" project. So far, he has managed to collect almost half a million zlotys there."
2519	28	Do they work or don't they work?
2519	30	"While Grzegorz Braun's position on COVID-19 vaccinations is clear - the politician does not actually describe them otherwise than as a ""medical experiment"" and ""genocide"", the rest of the Confederation's politicians tried to discourage them using a slightly milder rhetoric."
2519	32	“The goal of the Confederation is not to vaccinate as many Poles as possible. The goal is to provide Poles with a vaccine that is safe, tested and guarantees that it will not harm Poles. There is no such situation at the moment. Vaccines that are administered are poorly researched, hastily tested preparations. Preparations that simply do not guarantee safety,” said Michał Wawer, a member of the Confederation and National Movement, in January 2021 during a conference in the Sejm.
2519	34	The official profile of the Confederation also publishes data from time to time in social media that allegedly indicate the ineffectiveness of vaccinations. The last such graphic is from December 11:
2519	36	Of course, the more people vaccinated in a population, the more infections and deaths among those vaccinated. If everyone was vaccinated, these data would look even worse to the disadvantage of the vaccinated - because only they would be in these tables. These data also do not take into account a key indicator, i.e. the share of vaccinated people in hospitalizations. Finally, even the figures presented in this way indicate the effectiveness of the vaccines, which pointed out to the Confederation a number of Twitter users.
2519	38	"Soon after, Janusz Korwin-Mikke announced that the vaccines are safe and effective for some time. Vaccination is suggested for the elderly, who are most at risk of dying from infection. Children should not be vaccinated because, according to the politician, it is better for them to get sick and gain natural immunity. Because according to Korwin-Mikke, they are at risk of ""only"" PIMS, i.e. multi-organ inflammatory syndrome."
2519	40	"Krzysztof Bosak formulated a similar position on vaccines a few months ago, saying that ""people who believe that this is a good solution for them should probably get vaccinated against coronavirus."""
2519	42	We are not anti-vaxxers, but…
2519	44	It is true that most of the top Confederate politicians are not anti-vaxxers. A recording from 2019 has been making a career on the Internet for several days, in which MP Dziambor, during a meeting with voters in Sosnowiec in December 2019, says this:
2519	46	“I am not anti-vaccine. I did not join this movement. I am the son of a doctor, I have small children that I vaccinate. I can't imagine fighting for everyone to be able to do what they want with it. In this case, I may not be a libertarian (...)
2519	48	"I just think that you have to be responsible, and I see responsibility as listening to people who are smarter than me in specific areas. For some reason, all doctors vaccinate their children, and people who are not doctors and don't know about it try not to vaccinate their children."""
2519	50	Dziambor's statements date back to before the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, but it is hard not to notice the contradictions in his current attitude towards doctors' appeals to ensure that as many of the population as possible are vaccinated. His party's actions are heading in a completely opposite direction.
2519	52	"The Confederates simply see how large reach can be achieved by skilfully playing on the ""opposition gene"" and using the enthusiasm of anti-vaccine circles, and how great is the mobilization potential of this topic. So, although they are not anti-vaccine, they take an example and join the fanatically anti-vaccine Grzegorz Braun. The famous “Confederation Five” – apart from Jews, gays, abortion, taxes and the EU – were joined by vaccines."
2519	54	And that there would be nothing
2519	56	"In August, Braun, claiming that he was carrying out a parliamentary inspection, stormed into the office of the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products and demanded from its boss, Grzegorz Cessak, ""access to clinical trials of the population under 12 years of age."" He was accompanied by extreme right-wing blogger Marcin Rola, former TVP presenter Jan Pospieszalski and the authority of pandemic skeptics, Dr. Katarzyna Ratkowska."
2519	58	In December, the deputy tried to make a similar unannounced and unspecified, but broadcast live, parliamentary intervention at the Ministry of Health. This time he was accompanied by an MP from the Confederation and the National Movement, Robert Winnicki.
2519	60	"In 2020, Braun was repeatedly excluded from the proceedings and punished for not wearing a mask in the plenary hall. For some time, another member of the Confederation, Jakub Kulesza, began to regularly join his campaign of ""parliamentary disobedience"". Kulesza has also become famous in recent days by announcing that he is participating in the sessions of the Sejm, being a coronavirus carrier. The ""joke"" was that the MP gave patterns of coronaviruses with low pathogenicity, responsible for seasonal, mild respiratory infections."
2519	62	On December 15, the Sejm Health Committee was to work on the long-announced draft of the act on the rules of covid safety in workplaces. But too many deputies came to the meeting room - the entire Confederation club and their guests - all without masks. The meeting was therefore blocked.
2519	64	"The case is so absurd that PiS, fearing its own ""anti-vaxxers"" in the coalition, knocked out the bill's teeth. The new regulations essentially mean that entrepreneurs will be able to ask their employees from time to time to perform an antigen test."
2519	66	It turns out, however, that the Confederation's politicians don't like the tests either, because - as Artur Dziambor announced on Twitter - sticking a stick up your nose is very unpleasant.
2519	68	"They will be in opposition The Confederation can afford to catch the right-wing electorate irritated by the pandemic, they preach a populist program in the style of Krzysztof Kononowicz - ""let there be nothing"". No lockdowns, no restrictions, no masks, passports, covid wards, vaccinations. They will not bear the political responsibility for the deadly catastrophe, and if they have been vaccinated themselves - as their numerous statements indicate - they will not bear any personal responsibility for the theories and postulates they preach."
25190	1	The more renewables, the easier it will be for us to manage without gas and oil from Russia. The PiS government should wake up
25190	3	The war unleashed by Russia has caused an energy crisis. Everyone is accelerating the development of RES. The willingness of Polish entrepreneurs and residents to invest in these sources of cheap energy is huge, but it is blocked by energy networks that have been underinvested for years and legal barriers, which the government is delaying in removing
25190	5	Renewables have great potential to lower energy prices and make economies less dependent on fossil fuels. Especially Russian. With the development of new technologies and the growing scale of investments in RES, the costs of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines have fallen by several dozen percent over the decade, while their efficiency and durability have increased.
25190	7	Renewables are no longer expensive and subsidized, but cheap and competitive in relation to coal and gas power plants.
25190	9	In Poland, the capacity installed in renewable sources is almost 20 GW, which corresponds to one third of the total capacity installed in the power system.
25190	11	As calculated by Bloomberg NEF analysts, the unit cost of electricity generation (LCOE) from photovoltaics, i.e. the limit energy price indicator ensuring investment profitability, is currently 86 percent lower. than in 2010.
25190	13	In the case of wind turbines, the decrease in LCOE is 46%. despite the increase in the costs of raw materials, production and transport recorded in recent months.
25190	15	New projects of onshore wind farms and large solar power plants are around 40% more than in the world. cheaper than new coal and gas power plants, according to Bloomberg NEF.
25190	17	The ten-year cost reduction trend has been reversed in the last year, but still the cost gap between RES and fossil fuel energy is increasing due to the even faster increase in the prices of gas, coal and expensive carbon dioxide emission allowances on the EU market. Investments in cheaper and clean energy sources are accelerating almost all over the world, with China leading the way.
25190	19	Last year, almost 295 GW of new capacity was added in the world, this year the International Energy Agency expects 320 GW, which means an increase of 8%, higher than last year.
25190	21	In the first place here comes photovoltaics, the cheapest, the most common, ready to be used in large-scale solar farms, as well as small home installations used by prosumers.
25190	23	Importantly, Poland is among the world's leading countries where solar energy is developing the fastest, which is mainly the responsibility of the owners of single-family houses, who have invested massively in micro-installations in recent years. That is changing now.
25190	25	A sunny miracle on the Vistula River
25190	27	Looking only at the result of solar energy, it can be assessed that Poland is in the vanguard of energy transformations. Last year, 3.8 GW of new solar energy capacity was added to our country, which means an increase of 56 percent. Every year. In the ranking of the Solar Power Europe organization, Poland appeared for the first time among the market leaders, taking third place in the European Union, after Germany and Spain, and 10th in the world.
25190	29	"""This is a positive surprise that most solar market analysts did not expect,"" the organization assesses."
25190	31	"It is worth emphasizing that the Polish government did not plan such a rapid development of solar energy. The strategic document ""Energy Policy of Poland until 2040"" (PEP 2040) predicted that at the end of this decade Poland would have approx. 5-7 GW of solar capacity, while in May this year this capacity already exceeded 10 GW."
25190	33	Within seven years, there was a 100-fold increase in photovoltaic power in Poland.
25190	35	For almost 80 percent Micro-installations up to 50 kW correspond to these investments, mainly on the roofs of Polish houses, but also in supermarkets, offices, warehouses and production halls.
25190	37	Pure profit from the sun
25190	39	"The success of photovoltaics was determined, among others, by the system for settling the energy produced by prosumers in micro-installations, subsidies from the ""My Electricity"" program, deductions of expenses for photovoltaics as part of the thermomodernization relief and a decrease in the prices of photovoltaic panels."
25190	41	"Subsidy up to PLN 5,000 PLN from the ""My Electricity"" program, initially financed from the state budget revenues from the sale of CO2 emission allowances at auctions, generated about 20,000. PLN of investment on the part of the prosumer. No other technology in the power industry could boast such fast and spectacular effects."
25190	43	"The government did not foresee such a great investment spurt of Poles, which ultimately led initially to a reduction in subsidies in the ""My Electricity"" program, and finally to a change this year to a less favorable prosumer settlement system."
25190	45	While the future of rooftop micro-installations remains uncertain, the segment of large-scale solar farms is booming. As a result of auctions conducted in recent years, 6.5 GW of new capacity was contracted in solar farms, which are able to meet the country's energy needs in a short time.
25190	47	With the current high prices of electricity, the return on investment in a solar power plant is made in 5 years, after which the investor can count on a pure profit. On the investors' way to the sunny Eldorado, there is now only one, but a huge, obstacle - obtaining the conditions for connection to the power grid.
25190	49	Without the grid, there will be no RES
25190	51	Distribution grid operators have been inundated with requests from investors who want to connect mainly photovoltaic farms to the grid, because - unlike wind farms - they do not encounter significant regulatory barriers. Unfortunately, most applications are rejected.
25190	53	“There are reasons to shut down the network as conditions Milestone upwind
25190	55	"However, onshore wind energy has no chance for rapid development. In Poland, it provides the cheapest energy, which results from the geographical conditions and the maturity of the technology itself, but the projects of new wind farms were abruptly stopped by one act, introduced in 2016 by the United Right government, dubbed the ""anti-windmill"" act."
25190	57	She introduced the so-called the 10H rule, prohibiting the construction of windmills at a distance of less than 10 times the height of the wind turbine from buildings and protected areas. In practice, it excludes 99 percent from wind energy. of the country. As a result of auctions won in recent years, wind farm projects are being implemented, which obtained permits even before the entry into force of the anti-windmill act.
25190	59	New ones are no longer being created and there are many indications that they will not be created in the coming years.
25190	61	The wind industry has been striving for liberalization of the 10H rule for years, but the draft of such a change
25191	1	Standard setters
25191	3	It's good that there is no device in the world yet that would measure hypocrisy. If it existed, unfortunately, the scale would have to be adjusted on Wiejska Street in Warsaw. It's hard to imagine going any lower. am I exaggerating?
25191	5	"Well, let me inform you that Campus Polska's expert on hate speech is... Barbara Kurdej-Szatan, who became famous in Poland for vulgarly calling the Border Guard. Little? Maybe Donald Tusk, who laughs at… Jarosław Kaczyński's eloquence and stubbornness, will make an impression. What's next? Ryszard Kalisz laughing at someone for gaining weight? Franek Sterczewski indignant at drunk cyclists? Or maybe Sylwia Spurek eating a beef kebab? Everything is probably possible now, because it turns out that politicians change their minds more and more often, requiring stability only from political opponents. They do not see their flaws. And so Donald Tusk, who does not correctly pronounce the name ""rhubarb"", will laugh at the pronunciation of the PiS president, and Barbara Kurdej-Szatan, who begins her statements with ""k ... wa"", will teach about hate. And then, of course, everyone is surprised that Poles associate politics with septic tanks, and our voter turnout is at the bottom. Very strange, right?"
25193	1	Elon Musk about women. Korwin-Mikke replied: I've always said that
25193	3	The popular and eccentric billionaire Elon Musk posted a short entry about women. Janusz Korwin-Mikke applauded him.
25193	5	The opinion about women that connected Korwin-Mikke and Musk will certainly not appeal to feminists. The remark made by the American billionaire is, moreover, less and less heard in the so-called mainstream.
25193	7	What did Musk say? Well, he wrote that for women, being a mother is as important as a career.
25193	9	"""Being a mom is as important as any career,"" wrote Musk, famous for his very short but blunt entries."
25193	11	"Janusz Korwin-Mikke answered him just as briefly. ""Great! I've always talked about it! Women are the most important!” – wrote the doyen of Polish libertarians."
25193	13	Although many women in the comments agree with Musk and share their testimony, there are also opinions that it is the objectification of women, that the world has changed and is no longer the way Musk sees it. Also after Korwin-Mikke's reply, there were several voices suggesting that women are not the most important thing for the politician of the Confederation, because he would rather lock them at home, reduce them to the role of a housewife and forbid them to work.
25193	15	How did Korwin-Mikke respond to such arguments recently? - It used to be men who toiled for women, and now you sit behind a desk, flipping through a newspaper, and four ladies bustle around the office like ants and work. And these feminists still think that it is good, that it is in their favor – he said in one of the interviews.
25193	17	– Women certainly do not want to move these boxes in Biedronka, but if they want to paint, for example, let them paint. Maria Skłodowska-Curie, in times when there was no feminism, was doing great. No one forbids women to do what they want, as long as it doesn't ruin the logic of social life, stressed Korwin-Mikke.
252	1	"Is Nord Stream 2 a ""reparations formula"", ""compensation"" for Hitler's crimes in Russia? What the German president really said"
252	3	Polish politicians - prime minister, minister in the president's office, deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - have criticized the German president for allegedly suggesting in an interview that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is a form of compensation for German crimes committed in the Soviet Union during World War II. However, such statements were not made in the interview.
252	5	An interview with German President Frank Walter Steinmeier, published on February 6 in the Rheinische Post daily (also available on the German president's website), provoked a reaction from Polish politicians. The conversation was mainly devoted to the course of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, but at the end there were two questions about the assessment of German-Russian relations. Law and Justice politicians decided that Frank Walter Steinmeier's answer opened a discussion on compensation for Poland for war losses. Because the German president was to say that Nord Stream 2 is a form of reparation for the horrors that Germany inflicted on the Russians during the Second World War.
252	7	Only that Polish politicians refer to words that were not spoken in the interview - and appeared only in interpretations of this conversation.
252	9	For us Germans, it has a completely different dimension
252	10	"The first question on German-Russian relations put to President Steinmeier concerned the arrest and conviction of Russian oppositionist Alexei Navalny. The president replied: ""It is completely cynical to imprison someone who has just recovered from the poisoning he was subjected to in his home country. Russia is in violation of the commitments the country has made in domestic and international law to protect human rights. The arrest and conviction of Alexei Navalny has nothing to do with the rule of law."""
252	12	"He added: ""We must bear in mind the broader picture of EU-Russia relations. We must be clear and unambiguous in our criticism of the domestic political situation in Russia - and constantly look for common points in foreign policy to turn a bad present into a better future."""
252	14	The second question concerned the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is to transmit gas from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea - bypassing Poland, but also Ukraine.
252	16	"What are your views on the completion of Nord Stream 2? Are German interests more in energy security or loyalty to the US? – asked the journalist of ""Rheinische Post""."
252	18	The president replied:
252	20	If this would be so easy. But first: dialogue with the new American government on this issue has not yet begun. In addition, we should reconsider: after a permanent deterioration in relations in recent years, energy relations are almost the last bridge between Russia and Europe. Both sides should consider whether this bridge should be destroyed irrevocably and without anything in its place. I don't think burning bridges is a sign of strength. How are we to influence a state of affairs that is unacceptable to us if we are cutting the last links? For us Germans, it has a completely different dimension: we are looking back at our very turbulent history with Russia. There have been periods of fruitful partnership, but even more periods of terrible bloodshed. June 22 marks the 80th anniversary of the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. More than 20 million of the population of the then Soviet Union became victims of the war. This does not justify any wrongdoing in today's Russian politics, but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. Yes, we live in the present of a difficult relationship, but there is a past before and a future after.
252	22	First reactions abroad
252	24	"The Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin, Andriy Melnyk, reacted to this interview. The day after the interview was published, on February 7, Melnyk said in a statement that ""President Steinmeier's statements hit us deep in the heart, because Nord Stream 2 remains a geopolitical project of Russian President Vladimir Putin, contrary to Ukrainian interests. of National Socialist terror and, in addition, attributing millions of Soviet victims of the German war to the destruction and enslavement of Russia alone. Ambassador Melnyk criticized Steinmeier for not explicitly mentioning the many millions of victims of the Nazis in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union."
252	26	"Some German commentators also criticized the words of the German president. Clemens Wergin, a commentator for Die Welt, wrote on February 9 that Steinmeier's defense of Nord Stream 2 is a ""distortion of history."" ""The German president claims that Germany has special obligations to Russia resulting from the crimes of the Nazi regime. As if other countries of the former Soviet Union did not suffer the same, or even more,"" emphasizes the German journalist."
252	28	"On February 9, the British newspaper The Times covered President Steinmeier's interview and the Ukrainian ambassador's protest in an article entitled ""We owe Russia the Nord Stream gas pipeline for Nazi atrocities, German president says."" German President Steinmeier has infuriated Ukraine by defending the Russian pipeline project with the argument that his country owes Moscow a debt of guilt for World War II atrocities."
252	30	Polish media and Polish politicians react
252	32	"The German and British comments were accompanied by discussions of the interview with the German president, which appeared in some Polish media. On February 10 (at 5.06 pm), the wPolityce.pl portal titled the interview with Frank Walter Steinmeier and the reaction of the Ukrainian ambassador: ""Nord Stream 2 as compensation for Russia for Hitler's attack?! Scandalous words of the German president in one of the interviews."""
252	34	"A dozen or so minutes later, Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said in an interview for state television that the words of the German president indicate that Germany is ready to talk about war reparations. ""As we heard today the German president, who says that Nord Stream 2 is a formula for reparations or debt repayment for the atrocities that were inflicted by Germany on the Russians during the Second World War, I must say that it takes on a new meaning. If this project had be treated, Germany is ready to discuss reparations,"" said Przydacz."
252	36	"On February 11, in a morning conversation on Polish Radio, another deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk, stated that ""talking about the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is the worst possible way to talk about any compensation to Russia."""
252	38	"On the same day in the afternoon, Krzysztof Szczerski, Secretary of State in the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland, announced that, on the recommendation of President Andrzej Duda, he had a conversation with the head of the Chancellery of the President of Germany, Stephan Steinlein. As he wrote on Twitter: ""In the conversation, I conveyed our strongly critical position on the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and the deepening of Europe's dependence on imports of Russian gas."""
252	40	"After 2 p.m. on the portal of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" a text entitled ""Nord Stream 2 as compensation for Russia for Hitler's invasion? Indignation in Poland and Ukraine"". The author stated: ""German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, defending the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, suggested that this was compensation for Russia for Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union. Such suggestions caused an uproar in Poland and Ukraine."""
252	42	"At a similar time, the Dziennik.pl portal published an article with a similar title: ""The President of Germany: NS2 is compensation for crimes."" The text said: ""The British newspaper (""The Times"" - ed.) reported on Wednesday that Steinmeier estimates that because of Nazi crimes, Germany owes Russia a debt, and that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is one of the last 'bridges' between Europe and Russia""."
252	44	"In the evening of February 11, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote on Facebook: ""Nord Stream 2 is the worst possible form of compensation. Its implementation will not settle any historical scores - it will only improve the balance on the current bank accounts of the project's shareholders. Put simply: it is an investment that harms European solidarity. It is a threat to the security of Europe and one of its largest neighbours, Ukraine."
252	46	"On February 12, on Radio Maryja, PiS MEP Joachim Brudziński asked: ""If today the head of the German state says that Nord Stream makes sense, because it is part of a kind of compensation to Russia, then you have to ask: What about compensation for Poles?"""
252	48	Except President Steinmeier didn't say...
252	50	"Historian, expert in Polish-German relations, prof. Stanisław Żerko from the Institute for Western Affairs in Poznań, in several tweets commenting on the statements of PiS politicians, emphasized: ""Except that President Steinmeier did not say that NS2 is compensation for German crimes in the USSR."""
252	52	"The same was pointed out by Witold Jurasz, president of the Center for Strategic Analyzes, who commented on February 12 in a text for Onet.pl that ""the president, prime minister and deputy head of diplomacy, referring to the words of the German president, referred to words that were not uttered and resisted based on media reports which, apparently, have not been checked at all by the Chancellery of the President, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

President Steinmeier only speaks, though he could be more precise, about the need for solidarity with the victims of war. Nor can one conclude from his words that Germany opens up a field for discussion about reparations for Poland for the losses suffered by our country in the Second World War. This issue is played internally by people from the right side of the political scene, who, using the interview with the German president, want to warm up the topic of reparations, states Andrzej Byrt."
2520	2	Ziobro on covid certificates: I am not a supporter
2520	4	"The decision to vaccinate is an individual matter for each Pole - said the Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro in the Morning of the Catholic Radio ""Siódma-Dziewiąta"". - We are dealing here with a problem of a legal, ethical and constitutional nature, which cannot be easily solved - he added."
2520	6	The head of the Ministry of Justice was asked on Friday about the proposal to introduce an obligation to present a certificate of COVID-19 test or vaccination at the entrance to a restaurant or church. - I am not a supporter of such solutions, because I am a supporter of freedom - said Zbigniew Ziobro.
2520	8	"He made it clear that he personally supports vaccination. I have vaccinated myself and encourage everyone to vaccinate. Anyway, I have experience - unfortunately sad - from the Ministry of Justice that several people died, including young people, all unvaccinated, which seems to confirm the thesis that vaccination increases the chance of survival in the event of illness (…) Regardless of the fact that this was my view on vaccination, I see a problem of a constitutional nature in this matter"" - said the guest of ""Siódma9"" Morning."
2520	10	According to the minister, there is a lack of debate about the benefits and risks of vaccination. - I believe that the potential of reaching the awareness of Poles and making them make decisions that, in their opinion, will be the best for the health and life of themselves and their relatives, is not fully used - noted the head of the Ministry of Justice.
2520	12	"Ziobro also referred to the decision of the Minister of Health to block wider access to amantadine. ""These are such incomprehensible messages to the public, which may evoke unnecessary emotions, suspicions and various speculations that do not serve to thoroughly explain the matter and encourage Poles to make a rational decision from their point of view,"" the minister assessed."
2521	2	Covid-19. More countries in Europe are tightening vaccination rules
2521	4	No one is surprised by government decrees that make vaccinations compulsory for specific social groups. They appear even in those countries where the vaccination rate is high.
2521	6	"In a way, the implementation of mandatory vaccination was inevitable, or at least long-awaited. Virtually all participants in the pandemic dispute predicted this scenario. Opponents of the restrictions, accusing governments of ""sanitary fascism"", a term popular especially in the first half of 2020, from the first days of the plague, alarmed that politicians would force injections as a final act of suppressing civil liberties. Their supporters, in turn, sensed that even when the covid vaccine became widely available, there would still be a large group of those who would refuse to accept it voluntarily. No matter how you look at the vaccination obligations currently being introduced in Europe, they will always turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy."
2521	8	Vaccines save hospitals
2521	10	Vaccination orders are also, and perhaps primarily, announced by countries where the preparation has been voluntarily taken by relatively the largest number of inhabitants. This is the case in Italy, where as many as 87 percent of people have been vaccinated. citizens over 12 years of age. This country was the first, because already in October last year, it also introduced the obligation to have a Covid passport in workplaces in all sectors of the economy. Since April, under the threat of suspension and suspension of payments, vaccinations for medical workers and pharmacists have been mandatory, and on December 15, this provision was extended to teachers and representatives of uniformed services. On January 5, another law entered into force, this time requiring all residents over 50 to receive an injection.
2521	12	Members of Mario Draghi's government argued that in this way they wanted to prevent the deterioration of the situation in the group of society most threatened by the virus. Although Italy, like other countries in Europe, is currently experiencing a significant increase in infections, the next wave does not burden the health service to such an extent as in the previous two years - thanks to vaccines. The authorities are introducing mandatory vaccinations in risk groups mainly for fear of as yet unknown variants of the virus. The fact that the omicron dealt with society gently does not mean that subsequent mutations will be just as harmless, so immunity must be strengthened by all available means. In the Italian case, this order largely sanctions the existing state of affairs. Unvaccinated citizens over 50 are few, and two doses of the preparation have already been taken by over 91 percent. Italians over 60 years of age.
2521	14	Austria issues fines
2521	16	The first country where every citizen will have to be vaccinated will be Austria. On February 1, the law comes into force, under which anyone who refuses must take into account the consequences: first with a warning, from mid-March with a fine. Anti-vaxxers can be fined up to 3.6 thousand. euro.
2521	18	Although the vaccination rate in Austria is 72 percent. – less than in Italy or Portugal, but still above the EU average – the government does not intend to apply a reduced tariff. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg even stated publicly that only the adoption of the vaccine by all citizens can lead the country out of the endless spiral of lockdowns, quarantines and fear of new variants. He is also not afraid of the protests organized in Vienna and other cities almost every week. Because although they are loud and effective, they do not gather crowds. At least not enough to influence Schallenberg's policy.
2521	20	Greece is fighting the plague of fake certificates
2521	22	In turn, residents of Greece who are 60 years old or older will pay 100 euros a month for not being vaccinated. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been fighting anti-vaxxers for several months. In October, he made vaccinations compulsory for all employees in the medical sector, including private clinics. It also systematically limits the possibility of participating in public life to those who do not have valid Covid certificates.
2521	24	Now, as in Italy, it forces the oldest to be vaccinated. The argument is simple - as much as 90 percent. of fatalities in Greece fall into this age group. In addition, the country is plagued by a plague of fake vaccination certificates. According to Euronews, up to 100,000 citizens may have a false certificate. On the black market, they range from €400 in cities to just €50 in poorer parts of the country. That's why Mitsotakis introduced some of the highest penalties for pandemic counterfeiting. Just having a counterfeit certificate can result in a fine of 5,000. euros, and for its production you will pay up to ten times more.
2521	26	Compulsory vaccinations are not enough
2521	28	And what is it like in other parts of Europe? From September, French medics, but also people employed in transport and public transport, must be vaccinated. The Minister of Health, Olivier Véran, has announced that there will be no universal obligation to vaccinate, but it can be argued that it would not be needed. President Emmanuel Macron systematically limits the scope for anti-vaccine activists, excluding them from participating in subsequent segments of public life. In addition, the vaccination campaign is going much better than expected. The same assumption guides the strategy of Great Britain. There, the government does not introduce an obligation, because the preparation has been taken by over 90 percent. inhabitants.
2521	30	Combined with a clear, decisive and consistent policy, this gives measurable results. It must be emphasized that the obligation to vaccinate, even strongly enforced and accompanied by severe penalties, will not chase away the virus alone. It passes the test only when it is one of many instruments of public policy. Vaccines, combined with restrictions on the unvaccinated, universal access to testing and, above all, an effective information campaign, really save lives - but only for those who actually take them.
2522	2	COVID-19. WHO report on excess deaths. Only Romania is worse than Poland
2522	4	The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the number of excess deaths in Poland. According to data published by the World Health Organization, 19 percent died in Poland. more people than in previous years.
2522	6	Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic, a total of 6 million 6 thousand 298 people have been infected in Poland. 116,290 people infected with the virus died of COVID-19.
2522	8	WHO: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 19 percent died in Poland more people
2522	10	The World Health Organization has published data on the excess number of deaths as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the information provided by the WHO, Poland ranked second in terms of the increase in mortality. 19% died. more people than died before. Ahead of us in the ranking, where only the richest countries were qualified, was only Romania - there died 20 percent. people more.
2522	12	In other European countries, the excess number of deaths was much lower and amounted to:
2522	14	- Great Britain - 12 percent
2522	15	- Italy - 12 percent
2522	16	- Spain -12 percent
2522	17	- Germany - 11 percent
2522	18	- Netherlands - 9 percent.
2522	19	- Portugal - 9 percent.
2522	20	- Belgium - 8 percent.
2522	21	- Greece - 8 percent.
2522	22	- France - 7 percent.
2522	23	- Sweden - 6 percent
2522	25	In middle-income countries, the largest increases in excess deaths were recorded in Peru (97%), Ecuador (51%) and Mexico (41%). In the poorest countries, the highest excess deaths were in Bolivia (49%), Iran (29%) and Indonesia (28%).
2522	27	Coronavirus in Poland - the latest information
2522	29	The Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that from May 19 to May 25, 1,871 cases of coronavirus infection were confirmed in Poland, including 166 re-infections. A total of 60 people died - due to COVID-19 alone, it was 14 people, and due to the coexistence of COVID-19 with other diseases - 46 people. Over the past week, almost 56,000 tests for the presence of coronavirus have been carried out.
2523	4	Prime Minister Mario Draghi has tightened the course: vaccinations are necessary to enter the swimming pool, museum or eat in a restaurant. The decision sparked a wave of protests, on which right-wing radicals are capitalizing.
2523	6	Just a few months ago, before the delta again increased the statistics of diseases and deaths, in the Apennine Peninsula it was believed that there would be no compulsory vaccination. Although the government in Rome was the first in Europe to order all healthcare professionals and pharmacists to take an injection under the threat of taking their pay or suspension from practicing their profession, it defended itself against dividing society into vaccinated and unvaccinated for a long time. Health Minister Roberto Speranza has repeatedly said that vaccination is the most important instrument in the fight against the pandemic, but he prefers to encourage it rather than force it. In addition, the stabbing action itself, after a rather sluggish start, gained strength in the spring.
2523	8	The authorities, moreover, hoped that the citizens had not forgotten about the tragedy that affected them just over a year ago. Images that have circulated the world, like convoys of trucks transporting covid-19 victims from Bergamo, have been imprinted in the imagination of Italians. The country is slowly rebuilding itself - economically, but also as a community. So if not the government's request, at least the memory of the catastrophe was supposed to encourage the adoption of the coronavirus vaccine.
2523	10	Mario Draghi is taking it easy
2523	12	Hopes turned out to be in vain. Although this week the number of residents who took both doses of the preparation crossed the psychologically important barrier of 30 million, which means that half of the adult population is vaccinated (more than in France, Germany or Poland), Draghi is not satisfied. Not only because of the delta and the increase in cases - these are so far light, at the level of 4-5 thousand. new cases per day, much lower than in the UK or Spain. Italy is in peak season at the end of July and beginning of August. Locals and tourists will flock to the beaches, to the mountains, to historic cities and towns. Closing borders is out of the question. Tourism weighs too much on the Italian economy, it might not survive another blow. Resorts, hotels and restaurants must remain open.
2523	14	There is also a second reason, which is related to the first. The economy is bouncing back, and faster than experts predicted. At the beginning of the year, the central bank forecast growth of 4.4%. GDP, and after the first quarter he revised the forecast - upwards. He now estimates that the economy will grow by 5%. Some experts put forward even more ambitious theses, hoping for greater consumption. In short, Italy is trying to get off its knees financially, doing better than expected. Therefore, reconstruction cannot be allowed to be hindered by another wave of infections, followed by even a fragmentary lockdown.
2523	16	That's why Draghi prefers to be safe. From now on, access to museums, galleries, cinemas, theaters, gyms and swimming pools, cafes and restaurants will be possible only for those who identify themselves with the so-called green pass (passport confirming vaccination), or they are recovering or have a fresh negative coronavirus test result.
2523	18	The situation changed immediately. Nearly 700,000 registered for vaccination. people. In some regions of the country, such as Lazio and Sicily, this meant an increase of up to 100 or 200 percent. Sicily and Sardinia, traditional holiday destinations primarily for domestic tourists, escaped the ax of the sanitary regime at the last moment - due to the increase in the number of cases, some restrictions were likely to return, including earlier closures.
2523	20	Anti-vaxxers have political patrons
2523	22	"Not everyone in Italy liked this duty. Anti-vaccination movements became active, which, although less numerous and traditionally less rooted in society than, for example, in France, made a lot of media noise over the weekend. Covidosceptics took to the streets in Palermo, Naples, Turin, and in Milan they marched through the famous Victor Emmanuel II gallery, shouting that the obligation to vaccinate is an attack on their civil rights and that the government cannot interfere so deeply in their lives. They also added populist slogans about putting power in the hands of the people, Draghim terrorizing ""ordinary citizens"" and full liberalization of economic activity as the only recipe for a return to normality."
2523	24	And although at first glance this is not much different from the activities that anti-vaxxers carry out in other countries, the Italian version of the movement is particularly dangerous because it has found an effective political patron. The extreme right is already capitalizing on the reluctance of a small part of society to vaccinate: radicals have managed to frame the issue of vaccination with a completely new, unrelated to the pandemic narrative. When they protest against vaccine passports, they are not talking about public health or sanitation issues. They entangle the subject of vaccinations in the current ideological conflict and cultural war of the progressive left with populist nationalism.
2523	26	Giorgia Meloni is on a roll
2523	28	"Just a day after the announcement of the obligation to vaccinate, Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Italian Brothers, the far-right and most popular Italian group at the moment, wrote a fiery column against the prime minister in the party newsletter. Interestingly, she did not accuse him of violating civil liberties, which would be an expected argument, but of hypocrisy. In her opinion, Draghi violates the sovereignty of the nation, because he requires vaccinations to use Italian swimming pools, watch Italian art or support Italian teams, while not applying this criterion to migrants crossing the Mediterranean and ""landing on Italian beaches."" In this way, Meloni rewrote the discussion about vaccines. He does not have to convince the anti-vaxxers - they probably won't accept the preparation anyway. However, in Italy - as in any other country - there is quite a large group that has not yet decided to vaccinate."
2523	30	In this way, the far right strongly influences the undecided and inserts the topic of coercion into a broader political debate. Thanks to this, it is no longer about the pandemic, but about the vision of the state and its place in Europe. The Italian Brothers benefit the most from this, their members are active in social media and co-organize protests. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, is trying to beat them, but Meloni is on the rise. It seems that Salvini overslept his moment - he has been trying to use migration topics for years, but when he himself was deputy prime minister and head of the Ministry of the Interior, despite his promises, he changed little in this matter.
2523	32	It is the leader of the Italian Brothers who has her time, for which she worked for a long time. Last year, she was the only one to stand up for the former fascists, whose monuments were covered with paint in the wake of protests related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Today, it sets the tone for Italy's culture war. For the time being, he goes head to head with Salvini (their parties each have 20 percent support), and will probably surpass him soon. Unfortunately, the cost of this success can be huge, counted in dozens or hundreds of coronavirus victims discouraged from vaccination.
2524	2	Coronavirus - conspiracy theories or conspiracy practice?
2524	4	"Global geopolitical changes. Express production of vaccines and blocking research on ordinary antivirals. Secrets of the coronavirus genome. All these topics are the subject of heated speculation and conspiracy theories. Some of them exceeded even the expectations of the most unreal YouTube ""seers"". Below we discuss the most popular controversies that are the domain of the global information war."
2524	6	Unexplained genesis of the virus
2524	8	"The symbol of the ""common sense"" position is the famous market in Wuhan, where pangolins were supposed to appear. Allegedly, they were fed with bat droppings - typical carriers of coronaviruses. However, this is not disturbed by the fact that ... pangolins were not traded there. Neither do bats."
2524	10	"The symbol of the ""conspirators"" is the Institute of Virology located near the world-famous marketplace. Among the scientists studying there, e.g. citizens of Western countries appeared, and the facility itself is associated with a university in Texas. The fact that various scientific, business and political bodies anticipate the possibility of such an event may add an additional flavor to the whole matter."
2524	12	Bill Gates, whom I assure you I will not write about in the part devoted to vaccines, in 2015 spoke at one of the TED conferences about the high probability of an epidemic comparable to the Spanish flu. He also pointed out ways to prepare for such an eventuality.
2524	14	"Three years earlier, the American National Intelligence Council provided President Obama with a report in which one of the threats posed by China, fighting for global hegemony, was the use of biological weapons in the form of a dangerous virus. This information was provided to the Polish viewer by the journalist Mariusz ""Max"" Kolonko, who at that time did not yet show such exotic political ambitions as now."
2524	16	"An article about bat-borne coronaviruses was finally published in early 2019 by Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli (also known as ""Bat Woman""), actively involved in the work of the local Institute of Virology. Her research was used in the work on vaccines, because among the coronaviruses she described there were those whose genome is similar to sars-cov-2."
2524	18	Over the past year, there have been many scientific controversies about whether the coronavirus could have arisen spontaneously. According to the supporters of the thesis of the natural origin of the virus, the lack of traces of artificial interference that would have to arise if its structure was changed in the laboratory.
2524	20	Vaccines - Great Hope or Big Scam?
2524	22	When we talk about this topic, it is also about the long-term neglect of research on other preparations that could prevent at least a severe course of the disease.
2524	24	The most famous example in Poland is amantadine - a chemical compound used so far in antiviral drugs and drugs against Parkinson's disease. Only a few days ago, the Medical Research Agency allocated over PLN 6.5 million for research on its use in the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms. The actions of the Ministry of Health may be even more unclear here, which first ignored the reports of medics practicing this type of treatment, and then, at the turn of November and December, de facto prohibited the use of amantadine in cases of coronavirus.
2524	26	With multi-billion expenditures on vaccine development, significantly shortening their duration, there is a factor that cannot be omitted in any way - the lack of evidence of long-term effects of the vaccine.
2524	28	Although most virologists assure that they are completely safe and should not cause more NOPs than the norm, it cannot be overlooked that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in particular are a kind of medical experiment.
2524	30	These are not traditional vector vaccines, i.e. those that contain a weakened virus protein. Instead, they contain mRNA responsible for its coding. Our cells, based on this information, are to generate protein S, which, as an antigen, is to trigger the response of the human immune system.
2524	32	If we add to all this:
2524	34	- problems with the approval of vaccines by the European Medicines Agency,
2524	36	- refusal of registration of AstraZeneca's vector vaccine by Switzerland,
2524	38	- reports of illegal pressure from the heads of some public institutions to influence the decision to accept the vaccine by an employee
2524	40	all this does not help in the already difficult and logistically complicated undertaking, which is the National Vaccination Program.
2524	42	Cui bono?
2524	44	Regardless of the origin of the virus and the quality of drugs and vaccines that are supposed to stop it, someone has gained from the situation and someone has lost.
2524	46	The group of the biggest losers so far includes entrepreneurs and employees from industries most sensitive to limiting interpersonal contacts. In general, however, there is a visible trend in the world of small and medium-sized enterprises becoming poorer at the expense of large corporations. There are already cases of businesses being taken over by international corporations and cases of their nationalization.
2524	48	Depriving people of their property leaves them defenseless against all other designed forms of enslavement. It allows you to manage their fear and anxiety about tomorrow. It should be noted that the current situation also introduces a structural state of political uncertainty. To put it simply - it is a powder keg into which it is enough to throw a lit match in the form of another unforeseen event.
2524	50	We have been able to experience this on a small scale since the end of May in the USA in the form of protests by radical leftist circles after the death of George Floyd. When it comes to the game for global hegemony, China gained the most, which for a long time falsified data on the development of the epidemic in Wuhan and other regions of the country. They were greatly helped in this by the World Health Organization led by the Ethiopian communist Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Among the largest economies, they are the only ones to report GDP growth for 2020 (2.3% according to Chinese data, which, however, are probably fake). Many towns in Europe and the USA, on the other hand, resemble the set design of a ghost town from a B-movie to this day.
2524	52	Where is the conspiracy and are we dealing with it at all? I leave it for the readers to think about.
2525	1	Empty shelves in stores and the prospect of starvation - this is how pro-Kremlin media describe Europe after the introduction of sanctions on Russia
2525	3	"The sanctions work, but only on the countries that have introduced them - this is the thesis disseminated by the pro-Kremlin media. ""The main French question now is: how to survive?"" said Natalia Ivanova, describing the situation on the Seine in a report for Ren-TV. ""Europeans are now even saving on food,"" reports the Russian First Channel. ago - as Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin says - ""rogues who decided to take advantage of the situation and people's fears""."
2525	5	"The French even have problems with wine. Faced with the threat of a complete lack of food and water, the authorities banned the watering of lawns, gardens and private gardens. Goodbye cucumbers and tomatoes from your own garden. Given unprecedented inflation, fuel prices and energy shortages, the main French question now is how to survive,” Ren-TV correspondent Natalia Ivanova described the economic situation in drought-ridden France. In the three-minute material, the journalist emphasized in every possible way that the cause of the problems is not only the drought, but also the sanctions imposed on Russia. ""All this,"" he assures, ""may even lead to famine in France."""
2525	7	"The material appeared on Russian television a day after a meeting devoted to the Russian economy, at which Vladimir Putin criticized the sanctions, stating that ""their authors, guided by short-sighted, inflated political ambitions, Russophobia, hit their own national interests, their own economies to a greater extent, to the well-being of its citizens."
2525	9	Russian media: the euro zone may collapse
2525	11	Then Putin described the situation of the Russian economy as very good: he described in detail how well, in his opinion, the economy is coping with the crisis: - Russian business is replacing Western companies that have left, Russian wheat is producing a record harvest, and inflation in April fell several times compared to March - he stated.
2525	13	"The media quickly picked up on Putin's narrative of an impoverishing West. Analysts cited by the portal 1prime.ru said that imposing sanctions on Russia and restricting exports of fossil fuels could lead to a situation where ""anti-Russian sanctions will play against the European Union and lead to the collapse of the euro system: freezing Russian assets in European countries will negatively affect the banks of these countries."
2525	15	"The First Channel, in turn, broadcast a material in which it informed that as a result of sanctions in some cities in Germany, street lighting is switched off an hour earlier. ""Europeans are now saving even on food and watching with bewilderment reports from Russia about life under sanctions,"" said the channel's correspondent."
2525	17	Expert: A scenario with people queuing for food is very possible
2525	19	The Russians have stabilized the economy, but that won't help them in the long run. We won't see people queuing for food for a long time. But with the current state of affairs, such a scenario is still very possible, said Yakov Feygin, an expert on political economy at the Berggruen Institute, in an interview with Vox.
2525	21	According to Vox, the sanctions are already having a big impact on the development of technology in Russia. Moscow cannot buy products such as microchips used in the arms industry or artificial intelligence. There is a shortage of spare parts for airplanes and car parts imported from the West.
2525	23	Companies cannot purchase bleaching agents for paper or baby food packaging. A report by one Russian business outlet says that 90 percent of Russian bread makers rely on parts sourced from Europe; their current replacements will only be able to be used for a few more months, Vox enumerates.
2525	25	Empty ports and tips on how to get medicine
2525	27	"Although the message of the Russian media largely coincides with the Kremlin's propaganda line, one can find information in them suggesting that the sanctions are already working. In mid-May, the ""Izvestia"" portal published a text with tips on how to buy scarce drugs abroad. On the same day, another text on the site reported that many Russians in the first days of the ""special operation in Ukraine"" sold their properties in fear of confiscation. Some of those who got rid of their assets are now to be afraid of losing money, because it is easier to confiscate it."
2525	29	"Zapolyarnaya Pravda recently reported that Russian ports are running at half capacity because only those cargoes that were purchased and shipped before the sanctions were imposed still arrive by sea. ""And they will be over soon,"" the website reads. - Today, the situation with the delivery of goods is extremely difficult. All supply chains collapsed within a week of the start of the special military operation, Pavel Timokhin, commercial director of A Plus Holding, told the portal. Timokhin admits that problems began to arise even before the introduction of the first package of sanctions: - Goods sent or received by European Union countries and the United States began to be blocked until further notice, which immediately led to breakdowns in ports."
2525	31	Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, quoted by the site secretmag.ru, said that some stores created an artificial shortage by keeping products in stock and then placing them on shelves at a completely different price. - Immediately there were those who decided to take advantage of this situation, people's fears - said the prime minister. - Rogues! You should directly call those who tried to cash in on the panic moods.
2525	33	Mishustin emphasized that the law provides for serious liability for such actions: - Abuse of a dominant position entails penalties of up to 50 percent of annual revenue, and the participation of officials in cartel agreements up to 7 years in prison - he warned.
2526	1	Western sanctions work. The Russian economy is bleeding
2526	3	Western sanctions hit Russia harder than ever. They concern everyone, both elites and ordinary citizens. Some industries are on the verge of bankruptcy.
2526	5	A week after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, life in Russia has changed dramatically. The unprecedented Western sanctions affected almost every sector of the economy: finance, transport, tourism, culture, sports. New measures are introduced every day and it is easy to get lost in them. This resembles the so-called strategy of a thousand pricks, which is already straining the Russian economy. Only they are not stabs, but shock waves.
2526	7	In just a few days, the ruble lost about a third of its value. There are reports of queues in front of ATMs and problems with paying with cards or payment systems Google Pay and Apple Pay. Household appliances, but also Western clothing and footwear, may soon become scarce, as was the case in Soviet times. If the current trend continues, some experts expect a double-digit economic slump later this year.
2526	9	Russia prepared
2526	11	That moment has not yet come. The Kremlin admits the problems and expresses optimism: - Of course, the Russian economy is under strong pressure, a strong blow, but there is a potential for resistance, there are plans, it is being vigorously countered. The economy is not collapsing, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, assured on Wednesday in Moscow. The Kremlin argues that the situation on the markets will calm down soon.
2526	13	"At least since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia has complied with economic sanctions imposed by the West. There was even a euphemistic term for it. Instead of ""sanctions"", the Russian media prefer to talk about the ""new economic reality"". Now, however, the blow is much more powerful. A novelty is the creation of a crisis center headed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, which is trying to bring the situation under control."
2526	15	The overflight ban for Russian aircraft hits Russian aviation very hard. Travel companies are also seeing bookings fall by up to 70 percent. Russians who manage to reach their dream beach must have a lot of cash with them. The reason is the exclusion of some Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. For example, three hospitals in Thailand currently serve Russian patients only for cash. And when it comes to the flight home, it will also not be so obvious now.
2526	17	As expected, Russia's central bank reacted to the ruble crash and doubled its key interest rate to 20 percent to counter devaluation and an inflationary spiral. But the central bank itself is also under unprecedented pressure and seems surprised by the West's decision to actually freeze two-thirds of its reserves. According to Reuters, the president of the bank, Elwira Nabiullina, said in a video for employees that a milder scenario was expected.
2526	19	The middle class hardest hit
2526	21	The middle class is the most concerned about the crisis, writes the business newspaper Vedomosti. Some Moscow restaurants now have around 60 percent fewer guests. But the sanctions will be felt by all citizens, not just the middle class. So far, the Russians have perceived the sanctions as a kind of “punishment for the elites”.
2526	23	"""Now we realize that everyone will lose out,"" the newspaper quotes one psychologist. Sergei Utkin, a well-known Moscow economist, warns in the Kommersant newspaper of ""gigantic economic losses and the destruction of the lifestyle of entire social classes."" All this, he claims, is the result of the military campaign in Ukraine."
2526	25	It seems that hardly anyone in Russia took into account the sanctions in the field of sport and culture. More and more Russian teams are banned from tournaments. Sporting events like the Champions League final in St. Petersburg are being postponed, causing millions in losses to the local hotel industry.
2526	27	Russian cinemas in danger
2526	29	"Russian artists, such as the famous conductor Valery Gergiev, a supporter of President Putin, are losing engagements in the West. However, one industry was hit particularly hard - the cinema. When the new version of the Hollywood blockbuster ""Batman"" hits cinemas around the world on Thursday, Russians will not see it for the first time in decades."
2529	3	Speculations about the end of the operational capabilities of the Russian special services should be considered exaggerated at the very least. Despite the ongoing war between them, chaos, demoralization and criminalization, they remain an active player in the modern intelligence world.
2529	5	The information that appeared in the media that, by the decision of Vladimir Putin of May 11, 2022, the GRU took over the main tasks in intelligence operations in the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war, caused a number of speculations regarding the shift of the gravity vector in the Russian services to the intelligence military. Proof of this was entrusting the deputy head of the GRU, General Vladimir Alekseev, with intelligence coordination of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In this way, the FSB intelligence (also known as the Fifth Service), led by General Sergei Beseda (accused of conducting erroneous analyzes before the start of the war, which resulted in the defeat of the Russian blitzkrieg), was sidelined.
2529	7	"The operational management of the organization of the new blitzkrieg was entrusted to the so-called Syrians (as veterans of operations in Syria are called), i.e. Generals Alexander Dvornikov, Alexander Zhuravlev and the aforementioned Alekseyev. On the other hand, in the opinions of Andrei Soldatov (creator of the Agentura.ru portal) published in an interview for the Bgsniper portal and prof. Marek Galeotti in the ""Spektator"" newspaper, the GRU, due to the ongoing armed conflict, is a structure that should engage in tactical and strategic intelligence to help the Russian troops in this war. In light of this, it has become obvious that military intelligence comes to the fore in the current circumstances. This is war. There is little room for subversive activities and bribery-based influence operations in which the Fifth Service specializes, and its officers are mainly political operators interfering in political processes in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the so-called near abroad. Also Vladimir Quachkov, a former colonel in the Russian special forces, stated that ""the most important thing is that, at least among the military, everyone now understands that it will be a long, conventional war, and not the small military operation they pretended it would be."" As he added, ""therefore, some changes were made to the structure of who leads the troops on the battlefield"" and ""the GRU is primarily responsible for collecting intelligence information for the soldiers."""
2529	9	"As far as the FSB is concerned, it should be assumed that specific tasks have now been assigned to its Third Directorate, i.e. the Department of Military Counterintelligence (Russian: Департамент Bоенной Kontrrazведки - DWKR), supervised by the first deputy director of the FSB, Sergei Korolev, and headed by General Nikolai Petrovich Yuryev and his deputy, General Raszyt Alimow. DWKR has a number of secret collaborators in the army and has standards for ""placement in a counterintelligence support facility"" of a certain number of such military counterintelligence collaborators in military units (Russian: kontrrazведывательнго обеспечения - KRO). These include the mandatory presence of a resident (a seconded or infiltrated employee or a particularly valuable source), agents (recruited sources) and trusted operational contacts (providing information, not formally recruited). For this reason, he has and is a distributor of particularly sensitive knowledge regarding the actual number of losses among Russian soldiers, the prevailing mood in their ranks and shortages in equipment and supplies."
2529	11	"The FSB agreed to this transfer of control over the operational and tactical activities of the so-called Syrians, but it negotiated for itself control over all the occupied territories and approved the head of the presidential administration in the person of Sergei Kiriyenko as a kind of overseer of these territories. This became another contribution to the war that has been going on for many years in the Russian services. According to the Ukrainian portals Apostrophe.ua and Ghall.com.ua, Azovstal will be handed over to the administration of Ramzan Kadyrov, who is associated with the FSB. On May 16 in Mariupol, Kadyrov's representatives (Adam Delimkhanov and Magomed Daudov) at a meeting with State Duma deputy Dmitry Sablina (linked to the GRU) and the head of the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" Denis Pushlin informed that the Russian authorities had subordinated the steelworks to his people and to Sergei Aksen, chairman of "" Republic of Crimea"" (in the previous ""incarnation"" he was associated with OPG Salem, one of the most active criminal groups in Crimea, in which he was known under the pseudonym Goblin and with whom MP Janusz Korwin-Mikke willingly posed for a photo during his visit to Crimea)."
2529	13	At the same time, in Kherson, there was a conflict between the FSB and the GRU over the goods seized there: grain, agricultural machinery and transport equipment, as a result of which there were almost sharp clashes. For this reason (according to, among others, the Ukrainian portal Korabelov.info and Obozrevatel.com, which refer to intelligence data), the recent appeal to Putin by Kirill Stremousov - the head of the collaborationist council of Kherson - requesting recognition of the Kherson region as a subject of the Russian Federation without a referendum and the creation of the Kherson People's Republic can be considered an initiative of the so-called GRU Syrians. Hence, in the areas occupied by the Russians, both services set up competing representations of local collaborators. An example of this can be the city of Melitpol. There, the FSB appointed Galina Danilchenko as head of the civil-military administration, while the GRU appointed its man, Volodymyr Rogov, to the same position.
2529	15	The main difference between the so-called The conflict between the Syrians and the FSB and its allied SWR (due to their common KGB pedigree) regarding the war with Ukraine is not so much about the specific methods of conducting it as about strategic goals. The FSB-SVR tandem is inclined to stop at what has already been achieved and is not entirely sure whether it absolutely needs to take over the Nikolaev and Odessa regions now, it is ready to postpone this issue for several years. so-called Syrians, on the contrary, believe that at the moment it is necessary to occupy all of Ukraine and Moldova, and thus close the issue once and for all.
2529	17	"There is also a fierce media war going on. Igor Girkin, ps. Strelkov, former Lt. Col. Special forces of the FSB (in many Polish media incorrectly presented as a former GRU or KGB officer), a veteran of the First War in Donbass and organizer of the combat units of the ""Donetsk People's Republic"", he openly criticizes the actions of the Russian army and Minister Shoigu himself in Ukraine. He even calls for removing from Putin's circle - in his opinion - those responsible for bringing the Russians ""to the brink of military defeat"", and who may even contribute to a ""shameful and humiliating"" peace. Also Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, former VDV commander in 2009-2016, called the ""butcher of Chechnya"" (accused, among others, by Human Rights Watch of committing war crimes during the Second Chechen War, and according to Russian media, including putinism.wordpress.com, closely associated with the FSB-controlled dominant criminal corporation OPG ""Sołntsewo""), publicly claims that the implementation of the so-called special military operation in its current form has no chance of achieving the assumed effects."
2529	19	Frame demolition
2529	21	"The information presented above is only a stage directions for the real problems and challenges faced by the Russian special services (it is worth remembering that in Russian semantics there is no term ""special services""; they are referred to as the state security apparatus). Recent years have been a series of image failures, especially in relation to the GRU - the failed attempt to poison Skripal (2016), the failure of the attempted coup d'état in Montenegro (2016), the eavesdropping of the World Anti-Doping Agency in Switzerland (2016-2017), blowing up the Vrbetice ammunition depot in the Czech Republic (2014), and then identifying the participants of these operations, including Gen. Andrei Averyanov, commander of unit 29155 GRU, which should be considered as proof of the particular lack of professionalization of this service. In addition, photos from 2017 from his daughter's wedding appeared in the media space, where he performs with Col. Anatoly Chepiga, one of two GRU officers accused in the UK of attempting to poison Skripal and of being involved in other operations where they used ""unsuspicious"" Tajik and Moldovan passports. In principle, it can be assumed that the only effective operation of the GRU in recent years was - already described in InfoSecurity24.pl - the successful theft of 3 billion. euros from Wirecard, Germany's flagship fin-tech company, and bringing it down. Moreover, if we look at the expulsions of Russian diplomats suspected of spying activities in recent years, the vast majority of them were GRU officers."
2529	23	The Dossier Center portal's publication of a report on the structure and personal data of the FSB leadership is also not very good about the condition of the Russian secret services.
2529	25	"The recent expulsion of about 400 Russian diplomats and embassy employees, many of whom conducted activities beyond the scope of their diplomatic status, was a kind of demolition of the Russian services. Only Malta, Cyprus and Hungary did not take this step. There is also a question - as pointed out by Patryk Wintour of The Guardian - ""why will 290 Russian diplomats continue to operate in neutral Austria, even after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expelled four diplomats after days of hesitation"". By comparison, Austria has about 30 diplomats operating in Moscow. Many of them have been declared ""persona non grata"", meaning they are suspected of being ""intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover"". Their removal significantly weakened the operational capabilities of Russian intelligence. At the same time, there was information that Russia had recently ordered 174,000. new diplomatic passports. However, as the former head of MI6, John Sawers, pointed out, quoted by The Guardian, ""The West only records 10 percent of Russian intelligence activity."""
2529	27	The next blows came from the Ukrainian side. March 15 A list of 620 Russians who are allegedly FSB officers was published on the website of the Ministry of National Defense of Ukraine. Most entries contain names, dates of birth and passport numbers. Their home addresses are also listed. Some entries contain Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card numbers as well as vehicle registration numbers. In turn, on March 21, the Ukrainian website rettar.net revealed the data of 22 officers of the Operational Information Department of the Fifth Service, also along with photos, addresses, telephone numbers, registration plates and brands of cars used by them. This may mean the lack of effective counterintelligence cover for the officers and their families, which is the responsibility of the FSB Internal Security Directorate (Directorate Ninth), headed by General Alexei Vertyashkin, one of Sergei Korolev's closest confidants, the first deputy director of the FSB. This is compounded by the inability of the Russian services to use the OPSEC method. This is due to the reluctance of Russian soldiers to use encryption programs, the lack of protection against telephone tapping, not paying attention to sharing photos and background elements, and statements on social networking sites containing classified and sensitive information. Added to this is the flight from Russia of the former president's plenipotentiary for sustainable development, Anatoly Chubais, who probably has extensive knowledge of many sensitive internal affairs of the Russian Federation.
2529	29	"Among some officers in the Russian security apparatus, there was a mood of a kind of trembling. According to Christo Grozew, the creator of the international investigative website Bellingcat, some of them were looking for the possibility of taking their families out of Russia and exchanging the accumulated money (in many cases coming from corruption) for dollars and euros, and transferring them abroad. They know that the current situation may soon spiral out of control. They represent the part of the security forces that know the threats to the regime and are now preparing their own future. Generational issues are also important. Russia is ruled by old chekists, for example, the average age in the Security Council of the Russian Federation is 65, and most of them are people affected by the ""Versailles syndrome"", having its genesis in the collapse of the Soviet empire and burning with a lust for revenge."
2529	31	Ready for sanctions
2529	33	The situation described above could lead to the erroneous conclusion that the Russian services lost their ability to act effectively as a result of mutual conflicts and chaos. It turns out, however, that they are still fulfilling their tasks.
2529	35	"Despite the imposed sanctions, the Russian currency, after a temporary collapse, regained its value. Cutting off Russia from the SWIFT system was supposed to be a kind of economic nuclear weapon, the Russians were very well prepared for this step and the services played a significant role in it. Already a few weeks before the invasion, the local army-related media (including ""Kurier Wojenno-Przemysłowy"") published publications on this subject, in which alternative systems of financial resources flow were written. This means that in the ongoing war, the dominant unit in the FSB is the Economic Security Service (Fourth Service), managed by General Sergey Alpatov, and in particular its Department of Counterintelligence Support of the Credit and Financial System (Department K), headed by General Ivan Tkachev . The position of this unit is evidenced by the fact that both the director of the FSB, General Bortnikov, and his first deputy, General Korolev, come from Department K. The Fourth Service, in addition to its main task, which is the counterintelligence cover of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, primarily controls all financial transfers , making it Putin's main tool to control the richest and most powerful people in the country. The website agenura.ru quotes one former official as saying: ""There is basically enough material in the SEB to shut down any large company and imprison anyone you want from the management."""
2529	37	"The Russians have been dominating the money laundering and money transfer market for many years, using for this purpose, apart from tax havens, whose main source of income are offshore companies operating there, the ""leaky"" banking systems in Europe. An example of this can be the Vanagels Network, a network of several thousand companies registered in the years 2000-2012, including in Great Britain, Ireland, USA, Panama, New Zealand. It provided bank accounts that formed a network of ""financial highways"" that allowed $12 billion to be transferred and laundered. This network and a number of similar ones were created and supervised by the SEB FSB. This thesis can be confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Anatoly Yermolin, a veteran of the Vympel unit, who once published the text ""Why did they purge military intelligence?"" and transfer them through offshore companies abroad, and the GRU had the ability to control and monitor this practice, which made it a threat as not related to the KGB-FSB-SWR corporation."""
2529	39	"This shows that these networks play a special role in Russia's financial operations aimed at mitigating the effects of economic sanctions imposed on it, and in the sale of raw materials and grains stolen on a massive scale from Ukraine. At the same time, the ""assets"" installed in these economic entities and financial institutions may continue to carry out intelligence activities. Colonel Sergei Tretyakov, a KGB officer, and after 1991 the SVR, who started cooperation with the CIA, repeatedly mentions the method of the so-called ""business recruiting"", involving the use of business institutions to acquire agents by entangling business people in various types of not entirely transparent financial relationships. In addition, one of the hypotheses regarding a series of mysterious deaths among Russian businessmen related to the fuel and financial sector that took place recently is that these could be deterrent and disciplinary actions against those who could potentially reveal knowledge of Russian classified financial operations or have committed fraud."
2529	41	Ibero-American ties
2529	43	"No modern intelligence services are able to effectively perform their tasks without the use of outsourcing. The Russians understood this a long time ago, which is why they created a huge network of conscious and unconscious assets, including in key Ibero-American decision-making centers. The Portuguese journalist João Lemos Esteves describes this as the Russian Iberian strategy. This does not only apply to countries the ""Caribbean triangle"", i.e. Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, which are closely linked politically and militarily with Moscow. Russia's contemporary ability to influence Iberoamerica and the Caribbean, as noted by Evan Ellis of the Global Americans Institute, is a derivative of several interdependent phenomena:"
2529	45	- attitudes of anti-American governments that want to cooperate with Russia;
2529	47	- the supporting role of Chinese money;
2529	49	- the legacy of the former Soviet Union's military and other ties to the region during the Cold War;
2529	51	- Russian activities and investments offering some value to the region in key industries such as military, nuclear, space and oil industries, as well as agricultural purchases;
2529	53	- Russia's ability to wage information warfare.
2529	55	Since the beginning of the 21st century, Putin has implemented effective soft power in Latin America, which has now given Russia the opportunity to be an active player on this continent. In 2018, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil underwent political transformations, the effect of which was to create partnership opportunities for Russia and weaken ties with the US. Russian companies have invested in the oil and gas sector in Bolivia, Mexico and Venezuela, and have strengthened relations with Brazil, the country's largest economic tycoon. At the same time, there was a slow generational exchange in the local military circles, traditionally oriented towards the USA, to a generation with anti-American attitudes. For this reason, it should be assumed that relations between Russia and the local intelligence services have also been established, which probably results in the fact that they perform a number of operations for Russia, as well as the use of local financial institutions to transfer Russian money. All this made it possible to offset to some extent the effects of the expulsion of over 400 Russian diplomats.
2529	57	A new theater of warfare
2529	59	"While in the current situation the main task for the GRU in the ongoing war is to focus on its military aspect (contrary to the optimistic narrative, Russian troops are advancing deep into Ukraine), for the SWR and the FSB the vector of gravity is now shifted not so much to obtaining information as to create them using active agents. According to Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB intelligence officer who defected to Canada in the 1970s, classic espionage in the work of Russian intelligence involves only 10-15 percent. forces and resources, and the remaining 85-90 percent. it is creating information and gaining influence. This means that a new theater of warfare is being created, which is human minds, which is in line with the Russian doctrine of ""new generation warfare"", and its creators - S. Chekinov and Si. Bogdanov - point out that ""information and psychological warfare in will largely lay the foundations for victory"", which is to be served by the active use of the ""protest potential of the fifth column to destabilize the situation"". what people think, but also how they act. Francois du Cluzel, project manager at the Innovation Center at NATO ACT (Allied Command Transformation), states about it that ""it's not only fighting what we think, but rather, a fight against how we think."" Moreover, ""it's not just a different concept, another name for information warfare,"" but ""it's a war against our individual processor, against our brain."" (...)"" and ""the third important contemporary dimension The new theater of warfare is that a cognitive dimension has been added to the physical and informational dimensions. Thus, when kinetic forces fail to overcome an opponent, psychology and related behavioral sciences will play a key role. The concept of ""next generation warfare"" is not based on weapons, but on influence. Victory in the long run will depend solely on the ability to influence and change the cognitive sphere of the opponent. Special services will be the direct executors of these activities."
2529	61	The strategic goals of the SWR/FSB as part of the ongoing influence operation are to level the importance of economic sanctions by promoting the thesis that their social and economic costs in the form of inflation and increasing prices hit mainly the inhabitants of Europe. Thus, further military support for Ukraine will cause the conflict to spread beyond its borders, and Ukrainian refugees will lead to the destabilization of the countries in which they reside. Given the Russian influence in France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Hungary and their attitude towards the Russo-Ukrainian war, these tasks are being carried out. The last presidential election in France showed that three de facto pro-Russian candidates mattered: the extreme pro-Russian admirer of Putin - E. Zemmour, the centrist - M. Le Pen and the moderately pro-Russian - E. Macron. In Germany, the policy of close political and economic relations with Russia dominates not only in openly pro-Russian and outright agent groups, such as DieLinke or AfD, but also in the mainstream parties - CDU/CSU and SPD. This may be evidenced by the actual reluctance to support Ukraine militarily and to become independent of Russian energy resources. Not without significance is the fact that there are now over four million Russian-speaking citizens living in Germany, many of whom also have Russian passports. A significant number of Russians live temporarily or permanently in Germany, but do not completely leave Russia, retaining Russian citizenship and running businesses. In Italy, the pro-Russian attitude is represented by three of the main Italian political parties: the Five Star Movement, Liga and Forza Italia (the party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi).
2529	63	For the European public opinion, the Russian influence agency presents the thesis that NATO countries are responsible for the ongoing war, which results in progressive inflation, increased risk of nuclear confrontation and an uncontrolled influx of migrants. The French website RT, for example, reported that five African countries are at risk of starvation due to Western sanctions against Russia, while in fact it is the Russian navy that is blockading Ukrainian ports, halting exports of 25 million tons of grain and causing prices to skyrocket. Given the Russian engineering of forced migration as one of the methods of geopolitical techniques used by its services, the threat of the next wave of culturally different migrants is very real. In German pacifist communities there are more and more warnings about the possibility of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. A significant number of people in European countries also believe that NATO is at least partly to blame for this war. Campaigns are also being conducted to evoke resentment towards Ukrainian refugees by presenting them as an economic and criminal threat.
2529	65	"Also promoted - also in Poland - are the theses of the so-called offensive realism represented by John Mearsheimer, claiming that Putin's aggression against Ukraine is caused by the interference of the West, and that the United States, striving to expand NATO eastwards and establishing friendly relations with Ukraine, even forced Putin to take military action. According to him, ""Ukraine is not a vital strategic interest for the West"" and ""it is a vital strategic interest for the Russians."" In the name of this ""realism"", the war should be brought to an end as soon as possible at the cost of Ukraine's territorial concessions to Russia."
2529	67	"To paraphrase Mark Twain's saying (""the news of my death was exaggerated""), the recent speculations about the end of the operational capabilities of the Russian special services should be considered exaggerated at the very least. Despite the ongoing war between them, chaos, demoralization and criminalization, they remain an active player in the modern intelligence world."
253	1	Sylwia Spurek: What entitles us to exploit a dairy cow?
253	3	It is high time to answer the question whether we have the right to kill and exploit animals, assessed MEP Sylwia Spurek.
253	5	"In an interview with Interia, the former deputy ombudsman stated that ""we need a party that will approach the fight against the climate catastrophe in a principled manner and uncompromisingly to animal rights."" ""Without veganism, this perspective will not be possible,"" she said."
253	7	I entered politics to change the world, to effectively protect human rights, the environment and animal rights. I won't do it without expanding the boundaries of the debate. To change the system, you have to ask difficult and sometimes provocative questions. The meat tax is just part of my agenda. I propose a ban on the advertising of animal products because I want people to finally make informed choices. I propose zero VAT on vegan products, because I want everyone, regardless of income, to have the right to ethical and healthy food - said the MEP.
253	9	"According to Spurek, ""changes are taking place too slowly to solve environmental problems, save people's lives, end the era of animal exploitation."" - We need to speed them up systemically - she appealed, noting that ""it is not people who are to blame, but a system that does not allow for making informed decisions."" - Now people eat meat, drink milk because these products are mass and cheap. They do not know about the health consequences, they do not know the alternative. And the current price of meat is not real - she explained, explaining that ""it results from subsidies, from our taxes, for breeding, production, advertising"". - And it does not take into account the environmental and health costs of meat production and consumption and the costs of reducing the effects of the climate catastrophe - she added."
253	11	"We need to lead to a situation where what is healthy is available to everyone and what is harmful to people and the planet is no longer available - called a politician who got to the European Parliament in 2019 from the list of Robert Biedroń's Spring. She emphasized that she is against ""the use of animals for anything: sport, entertainment, research and testing."" - In horse riding, in sport, there are no relationships and bonds. This is exploitation, she said."
253	13	The question is: what entitles us to exploit a dairy cow? What entitles us to kill her child? It used to be believed that one could kill a child or beat one's wife, noted Sylwia Spurek. - Back in 2015, I was a vegetarian and had no reflections on the use of animals in milk production. I switched on thinking, she said.
2531	1	Brazilian President: We will not impose sanctions on Russia. Ukraine is ruled by a comedian
2531	3	The world reacts sharply to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, there is no shortage of dissenting voices, such as that of the president of Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro stressed that Brazil would not take sides. He added that he did not believe that Vladimir Putin's goal was bloodshed.
2531	5	Bolsonaro has departed from the official stance of the Brazilian government at the UN and has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ordered by Vladimir Putin, Reuters reports.
2531	7	The president of Brazil visited Moscow
2531	9	Shortly before the Russian invasion, the Brazilian president visited Moscow and had long talks with Putin. At the time, he said that he was in solidarity with Russia, which aroused the indignation of world leaders.
2531	11	"On Sunday, Bolsonaro announced that Brazil would remain neutral, and ""Russia and Ukraine are, after all, brother nations. And a large part of the Ukrainian population speaks Russian,"" the right-wing populist pointed out."
2531	13	"We will not take sides. We will help with everything we can,"" Bolsonaro said."
2531	15	No sanctions on Russia
2531	17	Jair Bolsonaro indicated that he did not intend to condemn Putin, but first he had to see the report and assess the whole situation.
2531	19	The Brazilian president has indicated that he is against any sanctions against Russia that could have a negative impact on the Brazilian economy. Russia sells to Brazil, among other things, fertilizers.
2531	21	"As he said, he does not believe that Putin's forces are committing mass bloodshed in Ukraine. ""A leader like Putin does not want to carry out a massacre anywhere,"" he said."
2531	23	"Bolsonaro also referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that Ukraine ""has placed the hope of its people in the hands of a comedian."""
2532	1	Orbán again wanted to torpedo EU sanctions. He managed to protect the Russian partiarch
2532	3	Hungary again tried to block the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia. Viktor Orbán did not want them to include the Moscow Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. But that was just an excuse. In fact, the Hungarian Prime Minister is playing for much higher stakes
2532	5	A retarded veto but unsuccessful. This is the solution that Viktor Orbán opted for in the negotiations of the next package of sanctions against Russia. On Tuesday, it seemed that everything was settled, and the leaders of the EU countries announced the success of the negotiations. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was also among the enthusiasts. Immediately after the terms of the political agreement were finalized, he boasted that he had convinced the partners from the Visegrad Group - including Hungarians - to accept a partial embargo on oil imported from the EU. It will apply to raw materials delivered to the EU by sea (according to Brussels, it is two-thirds of all imports).
2532	7	"Hungarians physically do not have the possibility to import it directly in this way. Similarly to the Slovaks, who are slightly less skeptical about the EU embargo, they receive the raw material through the southern branch of the ""Friendship"" oil pipeline. One could get the impression that Viktor Orbán's team got what they wanted - continued access to Russian oil. Further discussion seemed pointless. In the following days, the ambassadors of the member states to the EU were only supposed to finalize the technical details of the package."
2532	9	Orbán saved Cyril, the oil embargo will come into effect
2532	11	"It happened otherwise. Hungary decided to raise the stakes and boldly bet on an argument that seemed absurd at first glance. In the final discussion of the sanctions, Budapest said that they should not apply to Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Church. In the end, the diplomats who were finalizing the details of the sanctions decided to sacrifice this point in the name of a more important matter. Hungary managed to protect Cyril, but the embargo on Russian oil - at least that delivered by sea - will come into force. In addition, Poland and Germany will voluntarily break with the raw material of this origin flowing through the northern thread of the ""Friendship"" oil pipeline."
2532	13	Such a move by Budapest, however, should not be entirely surprising to those who follow the Hungarian government's relations with the Moscow Orthodox Church. They are very good, despite clear clerical support for the invasion of Ukraine.
2532	15	Patriarch Cyril dreams of a common Russia
2532	17	"Already at the beginning of the war, the patriarch suggested that both nations should strive for ""the unity of Holy Russia"", in which Ukrainians and Russians form one nation. In this way, Cyril reacted to the words of Ukrainian Metropolitan Onofrio condemning the actions of Putin's Russia. Then a Moscow cleric referred to the aggression against the western neighbor as a ""defensive war"". In early May, he stated, in turn, that Russia had never attacked anyone in its history, and all its military actions were always defense. He presented the war in Ukraine in terms of the struggle of the morally superior Russia with the corrupt consumerism of the West."
2532	19	”Kyril [civil name Vladimir Gundyaev] calls on Orthodox Russians to unite around the historical center of All Russia - the city of Moscow, because everything is not easy for the motherland and unity is strength. Only then, as he says, will Russia be invincible when we look for inspiration in the great examples of our compatriots,” Masha Makarova wrote in OKO.press.
2532	21	“In the Russian church tradition, the alliance of the throne and the altar has a long history, dating back at least to the fifteenth century. The Moscow Patriarchate, reactivated in 1943, was fully controlled by the Russian services, and close contacts between the church hierarchs and the authorities of post-Soviet Russia are one of the key elements of legitimizing the regime of Vladimir Putin – assess the analysts of the Institute of Central Europe.
2532	23	Orbán defends 'Christian values'
2532	25	The Russian cleric is particularly fond of two politicians – Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán. He warmly congratulated the latter on his victory in the recent parliamentary elections.
2532	27	"""You are one of the few European politicians who devote much attention to the promotion of Christian values, strengthening the institution of the traditional family and the norms of public morality,"" the patriarch wrote to the head of the government of Catholic Hungary."
2532	29	Cyril's defense against EU sanctions can therefore be perceived as a positive response to these words. The Hungarians themselves believe that by opposing restrictions on the clergyman, they are defending the freedom of religion guaranteed in the EU. However, the failed attempt to thwart the plans of the rest of the Member States was probably about something completely different.
2532	31	Cyril less important, something more is at stake
2532	33	In assessing Hungary's actions, the position of Budapest in the Community should be taken into account. Orbán – like Kaczyński with Morawiecki – would like to go against the current of EU values, and at the same time continue to benefit from subsidies from Brussels.
2532	35	At the same time, Budapest does not have many counterarguments to Brussels' accusations – and they speak of a crisis of the rule of law or media freedom in the political system dominated by the ruling Fidesz. In this situation, the last bargaining chip is a veto against EU decisions. This time, the Hungarians use it in the game for the Hungarian KPO, believes Andrzej Sadecki from the Center for Eastern Studies.
2532	37	“These funds have been frozen for a year. Neither Orbán nor the representatives of his government say directly that these issues are related.
2532	39	However, one can read between the lines that by blocking the sixth package of sanctions, Orbán and the Hungarians wanted to obtain at least part of the funds from the EU Reconstruction Fund, says OKO.press OSW specialist.
2532	41	Hungarians are becoming dependent on Russia, although they don't have to
2532	43	At the same time, Orbán continued to try to thwart the oil embargo plans. Although in its current form this point of sanctions does not apply to Budapest, Ursula von der Leyen announced that she would strive to completely abandon Russian oil in the entire EU. The Hungarian obstruction may have taken us away from discussing this topic. Budapest does not want to bear the cost of becoming independent from Russian resources, although Sadecki believes that it would be bearable for the Hungarians.
2532	45	The fact that Orbán is exaggerating is also heard from Hungarian commentators. This is the opinion of the former management of the state-owned oil concern MOL. According to Attila Holoda, former director of research and production, and László Miklós, former director of corporate relations, it would be enough to work on the possibilities of the Adria oil pipeline. This is an installation that supplies raw material from the oil port in Croatia through the Balkans to, among others, Hungary.
2532	47	”The Adriatic pipeline can already deliver 11-12 million tons of oil annually. After the extension of the pipeline, which mainly means the replacement of pumps and not the laying of new pipes, this value may increase to 15 million. According to them, raw material from directions other than Russia is already being processed by the refineries of the Hungarian giant. Therefore, the plants in Slovakian Bratislava and Hungary's Százhalombatta will be well prepared to switch entirely to the raw material from other directions.
2532	49	Russia an unreliable partner – even for Orbán
2532	51	The question remains whether and when Budapest will break its dependence on Russian raw materials. Even if the Hungarians completely abandon imports of Russian oil, the long-term contract with Gazprom remains in force. The contract signed a year ago with a company dependent on the Kremlin is valid for 15 years.
2532	53	“Sooner or later, Orbán will realize that his pro-Russian policy is short-sighted,” believes Andrzej Sadecki from OSW. As he argues, the Putinist regime, exhausted by the sanctions, will run out of money and resources to complete the projects implemented jointly with the Hungarian government. For example, the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant may be at risk.
2532	55	“I suppose that the Orbán government will gradually try to limit cooperation with Russia. But at the moment, he wants to get as much funds as possible from the EU as compensation for breaking these economic relations. Energy prices have been quite low in Hungary for years. This fact is often used in political games on the side of Fidesz. The party must maintain credibility in the eyes of its voters,” Sadecki believes.
2532	57	So it can be assumed that Orbán will try to shake European politics until he receives the first transfer from the Recovery Fund. Then he will be able to present himself to Fidesz supporters as an important player in Europe, whose bold moves bring benefits.
2533	1	Wolski: For the Russians, the use of cluster bombs is like going out for bread rolls
2533	3	"The war in Ukraine continues. It will soon be two weeks since Russia attacked our eastern neighbor. During this time, a lot has happened in Europe and in the world. Both in a political, economic and military context. The multitude of topics that could be discussed during this conflict is enormous. To this end, we spoke to one of the most respected experts in his field. This is Jarosław Wolski, a war analyst cooperating with domestic and foreign entities. In addition, the author of several hundred publications and analyzes in the field of military technology, whose opinions could be heard recently on the ""Historia Realna"" channel of Piotr Zychowicz, a recent guest of Hejt Park. We invite you to read."
2533	5	In the following conversation, we discussed such issues as: assessment of the activities of the Russian troops in Ukraine, the specificity of the Russian and Ukrainian armies, movements undertaken by NATO, upheavals in the world of politics, the possibility of Russia conquering Poland, the threat of a nuclear conflict, the condition of Polish troops, sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia, different faces of conventional war, the importance of information warfare, Putin's mistakes, the figure of President Zelensky, possible scenarios for the future.
2533	7	What surprises you about this war?
2533	9	Russian aggression. The Russians doctrinally believe that the army must be mobilized and operationally developed. In terms of mobilization - reservists are appointed, the reservists go to the point where the equipment is accepted, and then they have to be formed into a unit. Very often it still needs to be trained. It takes a lot of time. Mobilization is a demanding process for the state. Only the Russians mobilized only four brigades. And they are able to mobilize up to 20 divisions in six months. It's a huge force. It surprises me that the mobilization was so weak.
2533	11	Another thing - the Russians hit the Ukrainians with absurdly small forces. We are talking about 200,000 soldiers, while the Ukrainians had over 200,000 before the outbreak of the war. This is the antithesis of Russian operational art. The Russians should have two or three times the advantage. They should have mobilized 400,000 or 600,000 troops. Remember that the full scale is about 1.5 million. But they didn't.
2533	13	The first signal that this conflict is imminent came in October 2021. Various analytical agencies received information that the Russians should be very carefully watched. Major companies working for the government reported that the conflict would break out around February 2022. Everyone stared at it in disbelief. Later, there were more warnings - the dislocation of troops, staffs, the development of field hospitals ... Some of the Russian troops from the far eastern and central districts were transferred to Belarus, where they performed exercises. Civilian analysts were already confident in December that this aggression would take place. The military, on the other hand, claimed that it was impossible to attack the Ukrainians with such small forces. That was the official position. On the other hand, the Americans and British sounded the alarm. They were actually the only ones who openly warned that there would be aggression.
2533	15	I am also surprised by the direction of the attack on Kyiv. I'm not ashamed to say I was wrong. I believed that the forces that the Russians have will make it possible to create a corridor from the Crimea to the Donbass and tear off part of Zadniepr. I rejected the vision that this would be enough to conquer Kiev, let alone all of Ukraine. It turned out, however, that the Russians want to do it with the absolute worst forces. These are units with the worst equipment, communication and training. Pardon the expression, but the Russians wanted to conquer Kyiv with military riffraff.
2533	17	And here we come to the point that something in the Russian plan went very wrong. Either they wanted to decapitate or coup. Only it was stopped by the security services of Ukraine. Perhaps the Russians assumed that it would be possible to kill President Zelensky. That some officers will be killed, that the head of the army will be beheaded. And that then it will be possible to make a landing at the airport near Kiev, sow panic and effectively send units from Belarus. The Russians may have wanted to repeat the situation that took place in the Crimea. None of these things happened. The Ukrainians defend themselves beautifully.
2533	19	"Do you maintain the thesis that the attempt to conquer Kiev was a plan drawn with a crayon on the map? This is what you said during a conversation with Piotr Zychowicz on the ""Historia Realna"" channel."
2533	21	"I had that impression. But I also had the opportunity to talk to people who know the Russian art of war very well. They told me ""Jarek, you are wrong"". This operation was also prepared in advance. Only the same people told me that they totally did not expect the Russians to throw their weakest forces at Kyiv. Except for one Spetsnaz battalion that tried to land at Hostomel airfield and was destroyed. The Russians horribly underestimated the Ukrainians. They hoped the army would disintegrate once the president and general staff had been eliminated. The Russians showed a complete amateur in the attack on Kyiv."
2533	23	Isn't it so that the Russians in this war turned out to be a colossus with feet of clay? Didn't they get the impression that they were more powerful than they really are?
2533	25	Certainly the Russians overestimated their own capabilities. But I would be careful with the statement about the colossus with feet of clay. It is an army that is prepared for a certain way of fighting. By mobilizing, developing in combat, using numerical superiority and using the full spectrum in combat from the very beginning, excluding nuclear weapons. According to a certain logic of actions, it is an army that is successful.
2533	27	In this case, however, we see that many things have gone wrong. The question is whether someone is crazy or we are dealing with some kind of sabotage, because it really does not fit in the head. In the north, we see something that supposedly has been prepared, but is poorly implemented. I will say right away that this is the worst Russian military operation since the Winter War. On the other hand, we have actions in the Crimea and the entry of Ukrainian troops to the rear defending Donbass and Luhansk. There we see a well-prepared army, logistics are not broken, everything is correct. The Russians are fighting efficiently, they have defeated a number of Ukrainian fortifications. There, contrary to appearances, the Ukrainian army had a lot of units. So we have armies of two different speeds.
2533	29	There is a belief that if one wants to, someone will always find an argument to evaluate the Russian army. There will be reasons to say that this is an army that is falling apart. But also that the current operation is an accident at work and generally the Russians have a good army. We must wait with such assessments until the end of the conflict. Certainly the situation is that the Russians are bogged down in Ukraine. If they don't mobilize their reserves, they won't be able to win.
2533	31	Can we assume that Ukraine will defend itself and somehow claim victory?
2533	33	Without NATO's support, the war would have been over. NATO reacted to the actions of the Russians much earlier - more than six months before the outbreak of the conflict - and it is working properly. Mainly the US and UK. Delivery of weapons, supplies, guaranteeing nodal satellite communication, which is very difficult to disrupt and allows for rapid transfer of information. Building an information advantage, the awareness that you know more than your opponent, is crucial. In general, the Ukrainians do not differ tactically from the Russians. They may have older tanks or worse ammunition, but they still have a lot of equipment and very brave soldiers. And they seem to have commanders on the battlefield who are really good at tactics.
2533	35	The problem is that, in my opinion, the Ukrainians are able to block or weaken the Russian troops that have already entered their country enough to force them to retreat. Or inflict such losses on them that the Russians will no longer achieve operational objectives. Let me just point out: we are talking about the forces that are already in Ukraine. If the Russians mobilize fresh units, unfortunately, there is a risk that in the perspective of a long-term conflict, Russia will win. She will win the war of attrition, her advantage will be higher. Let us remember that the Ukrainians also suffer losses, they are also tired of the war.
2533	37	Putin has not announced a general mobilization. Of course, he continues to appoint more reservists, but the state, so to speak, is not entering a war regime. If this happens, despite all the support from NATO, Ukraine will lose and there will be a forcible change of government in Kiev.
2533	39	There may also be a stalemate, negotiations. There are rumors that Ukraine would be able to accept the loss of Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk in exchange for a ceasefire. The question is, at what point will the Russians realize that it won't be such a bad cost to extricate themselves from this brawl. It can be suspected that the Russians will try to break a corridor from Crimea to Donetsk and Luhansk. It's very important to them. As for the room - the key to it lies somewhere else. Between Russia and Ukraine and Western Partners. Because the most important thing for Russia will be to lift all possible sanctions that have already devastated their economy. It is known that they have not been completely cut off from the Swift system yet, but this economy is as dead as it gets. This man got the fatal shot, he just hasn't hit the ground yet.
2533	41	Russia was prepared for sanctions, but certainly not that huge. Hence the question of whether even Putin, who may have lost some real contact with reality, will not come to his senses and back down, seeing that Russia is bleeding from the inside. It seems that this conflict is completely unprofitable in terms of costs for the Russians.
2533	43	Unfortunately, wars have little to do with rationality. I think people underestimated Putin. They couldn't imagine what he was capable of doing, even at the expense of his own people. As for the West, Russia has rather correctly read that NATO countries can unite militarily. NATO knew what was coming, except that it had absolutely no fear for the Baltic states and, of course, for Poland. They transferred what they needed to us just in case. But there was no panic. The axis of the conflict was known and it was not a surprise attack on our country or the Balts. This was clear from all the analyses.
2533	45	What about political unification? Please note how long the Germans delayed the sanctions. And here we have the figure of Putin, who has done two monstrous things for himself. First, he insulted the French president. The French are very sensitive about their own dignity, national pride speaks through them. Putin humiliated Macron in negotiations to try to stop Russian aggression. Knowing the French, they will never forgive Putin for this. Just look at the strong signal the French sent to the Germans. They shook them, woke them up. And what is important is the message that France has released regarding the use of nuclear weapons. She reminded Putin that she too is a nuclear power. What's more, there are also tactical weapons that can be used to respond to smaller nuclear attacks. It would be an exchange. It wouldn't stop at just one nuke.
2533	47	There is one more thing about nuclear weapons here. There may be several more explanations for the use of such small forces by Russia. The first is, of course, the assumption of complete decapitation and the Ukrainians' lack of will to defend themselves. The second - the assumption of the use of nuclear weapons, which makes sense when smaller units are sent to fight, which can traverse bombed areas. But I wouldn't even consider such a scenario, because it would mean that NATO's reaction stopped the Russians from implementing such a plan. Of course, this is pure science fiction. I have no evidence of that.
2533	49	So that it's not that Wolski threatens nuclear annihilation, nothing like that. The number of explanations for the use of such small forces by Russia is simply limited. I think there are three. Either someone in Russia is an idiot, or someone assumed the surrender of the Ukrainians, or they thought about using nuclear weapons. As a person associated with the military and analysis, a red light went off for me in connection with the last option. There's not much to say about it, and it would make sense.
2533	51	Returning to the conventional side of the conflict, NATO has proven itself as an alliance. The European Union as a political block too, but Germany and Italy had to be shaken. On the other hand, we can say about Hungary that they are Putin's useful idiots in Europe. There is no other way to define them.
2533	53	Many experts underestimated the role of NATO before the start of the conflict. In Poland, this alliance was undermined. There was such a media oozing of venom. And then they won't come, then they won't die for us, and so on. Okay, this is a nice business. Books are written, broadcasts are recorded, cliques are collected. You have to earn something. Sure, you may not like NATO, but let's remember that the Russians have a cognitive operation deadline. They create experts who work in their favor. This was the case before 2014 in Ukraine. There were experts who said that there was no point in fighting, Crimea was not needed and it was better to make deals. Why do we need NATO, the EU… I have the impression that in Poland we had not only politicians' voices, but not only that NATO would not help us. That's why I'm glad that when the Russian tanks were 30 kilometers from Kiev, suddenly common sense returned to everyone. Suddenly it turns out that NATO is great.
2533	55	In your opinion, NATO is doing everything it can? There is much talk about closing the airspace over Ukraine, but this would probably be one step taken too far.
2533	57	In my opinion, NATO is doing everything that the situation allows. Next is only open war with the Russians. The help that NATO is giving the Ukrainians is unbelievable. The final option before the outbreak of World War III, and perhaps the initiating movement, is a no-fly zone over western Ukraine to create humanitarian corridors. This is an option that would completely bury the Russians' chances of conquering Ukraine and winning the conflict. The heart says: let's do it, the Ukrainians will win. But common sense says: well, no, it will end with flying Iskanders, but with the A warhead, i.e. atomic.
2533	59	One has to be careful when making such claims. NATO has the power to enforce something like this, no question about it. NATO is a power. But it's a huge risk. And for us, of course, a bad way out. So I wouldn't expect anything more on the NATO side than what we've seen so far. The aid is aimed at ensuring that Ukraine is able to fight alone. At the same time, NATO sends a signal to Russia that if it continues with its not-so-good ideas, it will end up in a no-fly zone. But I don't think that option is being seriously considered at the moment.
2533	61	I would go back to the economic sanctions that you mentioned and noticed an interesting thing about this. They were huge and fast. It's a surprise to me. Well, it's almost nuclear sanctions. The question is whether this is the bargaining chip of the West. Something to play with forcing the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine. Is it simply an action aimed at completely destroying the economy in Russia. So that for the next decade, even after winning the war in Ukraine, Russia would not be able to threaten anyone.
2533	63	As for the possible use of nukes, isn't it a bit like Putin owes much to the politics of fear, even more than to real action? That is: he created such a background that he can do whatever he likes in Ukraine, and NATO will not join the fight anyway, because it is afraid to check whether Putin's threats are a bluff.
2533	65	Please note that France's declarations about a nuclear umbrella over Poland can be interpreted in the same way. In the spring of last year, the French made such a proposal that the French nuclear deterrent forces would also protect Poland under a bilateral agreement. Our authorities ignored this idea, treated France very badly. We may not receive such an offer a second time because we have offended the French. This is a big mistake. At the time, it still seemed illogical. One could wonder what the president of France meant. After a year, we see that most likely the French knew more than ours. It was probably supposed to be a signal that there was no permission for a small nuclear conflict in Europe.
2533	67	In the first days of the conflict, a message was sent from the US and France that if Putin does what he intends to do, he will land in The Hague. On the one hand, it can be assumed that it is about crimes against the Ukrainian population, i.e. dropping cluster bombs, which by the way are not prohibited by any convention. The same goes for thermobaric bombs. Several countries agree not to use such weapons, but Russia and Ukraine have not subscribed to such a thing.
2533	69	Returning to the issue of the atomic bomb, the message I mentioned could also concern its use by the Russians. In the West, they might have suspected that someone in Russia had their finger on the trigger and was ready to start a small nuclear conflict. Now, if you ask me whether sending a nuke to Bialystok would prompt an immediate NATO response, I say yes. I'm sure about that. We would have an exchange. However, if the same were to happen in Ukraine, I would not bet here. I would agree with your opinion that NATO would not be willing to escalate the conflict, although I want to point out that we are moving in the realm of conjecture. We make hypotheses that make sense, but we have no evidence for them.
2533	70	In that case, I'm going to ask about something that can be determined right now. What is the state of Polish troops in the context of any attack from Russia? Of course, this is a very unlikely vision, but you said recently that Poland could not hold out as long as the Ukrainians. It is also often said that the Polish army should be reformed.
2533	72	Firstly, Poland is in no way in the Russians' crosshairs when it comes to conventional conflict. This is a scenario that is on the complete margin of probability. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russians never intended to conquer or even occupy our country. If you look at the opinion of a number of Russian authors expert in the subject of war, it is a unanimous position. Even in neo-imperialist visions based on the paradigm that all Orthodoxy should be united around Russia, at most they would like to create a neutral government in Poland, remove it from NATO, leave it in the EU and deprive it of arms. So much. This is the most daring idea of ​​what could ever be done with Poland. Conventional aggression was not seriously considered, because the Russians know that they do not have the strength for it. They would have to mobilize themselves completely to even think about conquering Warsaw.
2533	74	"Yes, the Polish army is weak, but it is modernizing. In my opinion, the direction of this modernization is right. It is only necessary to remember that Poland is not alone. Considering the scenario ""us vs russians"", it really looks bad. But we have NATO. Since NATO is helping Ukraine and was doing so even before the start of the war, it is difficult to follow the narrative that Poland would fight against the Russians alone. Repeating information that the Russians are practicing attacks on Warsaw is nothing more than spreading panic and disinformation, which is intended to weaken Polish participation in the defense structures of the alliance."
2533	76	In general, I would like to reassure people about the army. Of course, I criticized the purchases of our army myself. The Armaments Agency people are blue when they see what I write about some purchases and how they are carried out. But that's my role as a whistleblower. That's why I have several hundred publications about armored forces, anti-tank defense and artillery. In them I state what could be done better, differently. But apart from my sounding the alarm, I have to say that the general direction of the reforms in the Polish armed forces is well chosen. Just look at the purchase of fifth generation fighters. Looking at the incompetence of the Russians in the fight against the Ukrainians, fifth generation aircraft with the support of NATO situational awareness is a good direction. Anyway, the Finns buy these machines twice as much - 64.
2533	78	Please also note that we are building the Fourth Division, of which I was a critic at the beginning. I didn't think there would be any money or people to do it. It turns out they are. It seems that patriotism in society is growing a bit and there will be no such problem with personal status as it was a few months ago. Another thing - we also bought Javelins. I think Spike is a better system. But if we notice that a small number of missile launchers have been purchased, the operators of the Territorial Defense Forces are being trained, and, besides, we add the fact how many missiles the Americans have sent to Ukraine - you can see that someone has thought it through wisely. Not the best equipment on the market was purchased, but the most common and most used by our most important ally.
2533	80	"Another issue - the Territorial Defense Forces. I also criticized this project because it sucked forces from the Land Forces and the command of the Special Forces. But that was five years ago. Now, when we look at what is happening in Ukraine, I have to put ashes on my head and say ""oh no, this is a bull's-eye."" Not because light infantry with grenade launchers and armor-piercing shells can stop a tank. This is cool Ukrainian propaganda that has little to do with reality. Today, the Territorial Defense Forces are an extremely important component of the Polish armed forces. They must exist."
2533	82	Jacek Bartosiak stated that the reform of the Polish army must be diametrical. That the Polish authorities cannot treat the army with neglect and more investment in this segment is needed. Besides, it seems to me that many countries in Europe realized from the war in Ukraine that they had to be constantly vigilant and even better prepared. The Germans also seem to have understood that they cannot eat from Putin's hand and that the German army must be duly strengthened.
2533	84	You have raised some important issues. As for the vision of attorney Bartosiak - I think that the planning of reforms of the army should be left to the military. I, despite quite a lot of knowledge, would not dare to tell the military how they should do something. I can suggest something, but I am very humble about my knowledge and ignorance at the same time. Why? No civilian will ever have the knowledge that generals with specific combat experience and knowledge acquired in American military schools have. These are people who have access to classified and top-secret information. These are professionals. Let's let them work. Of course, the military can be criticized, because it is not a sacred figure. But you have to be aware that any brilliant concept created by a civilian can fall apart within days of the start of a conflict.
2533	86	"As for the question of the awakening of Western European countries, it is an interesting thing. The Germans have drawn up a program to modernize the Bundeswehr from 2017. Their army was an eternal field of austerity on the part of all possible governments. They know exactly what they want to buy, in what quantity and in what order. And this sudden decision on the 100 billion euros they intend to allocate to the military in 2022 is manna falling from the sky from the perspective of the Bundeswehr. Just keep in mind that this is extra money added to what they planned to spend by 2030. Not something like ""we have more money, so let's quickly buy this and that."""
2533	88	Germans are very cynical, methodical and selfish. They had everything planned in advance. They realized that they had cut up their ground forces too much in the previous decade. That's why they decided to create more units, buy more tanks, self-propelled howitzers, infantry fighting vehicles... Generally, they focus on the development of heavy troops, because they believe that they have the greatest survivability on the battlefield.
2533	90	The Germans have already decided that they want to buy F-35 aircraft in the USA, which are absolutely the best option on the market in terms of use for specific tasks. The rest of the money, some 80 billion, will go to the arms industry. This money will stay in Germany. Germany is one of the largest arms producers, let's remember that.
2533	92	I think that in Germany the time has come for generals, not politicians. In a word: German politicians will start to listen to the generals who have been saying for a long time that the Bundeswehr needs to develop certain capabilities and is too small in relation to the needs. Personally, I'm happy about it, because the Germans believe that Poland is the most important shield for them. The economic links between us are so strong at the moment that our presence in the sphere of influence of the European Union is absolutely vital for them. Hence, it can be expected that the Germans will take their allied commitments towards Poland seriously.
2533	94	One more thing - the planning and implementation of the plan in Germany looks a bit different than in Poland. There, people debate, then generals make a concrete decision, and blindfold themselves to one vision for a decade. It is both weakness and strength at the same time. Strength, because regardless of the change of government, the concept does not change. So now, in the face of the war in Ukraine, we are simply dealing with a rapid development of what they set out to do in the previous decade. It's nothing surprising.
2533	96	On the other hand, what really surprised me was the rapid turn of the Germans in terms of energy policy. The Germans shook themselves off, stopped sitting on two stools and, in a sense, cut themselves off from Russia. It remains to be seen whether this is a one-time spike or a trend. In any case, for the Germans, this is an unlikely coup, because they had a policy focused on using energy resources from Russia. That changed in a week. It's a revolution.
2533	98	"We, on the other hand, as Poles, like to improvise. Do something on the principle of ""okay, it will work, although it will not be buttoned up."" This is our national feature, we are used to it. It is worse with methodical action, which is the domain of the Germans, and at the moment it did not take place. Therefore, from the perspective of the Polish plot, we are not able to fully imagine what happened in Germany. They did something they weren't used to."
2533	100	Coming back to strictly military issues, can we say that Russia is, to some extent, discrediting itself in the eyes of the world? Isn't it a bit like this conflict, so far Putin has hurt himself more than helped? We see Russian troops in Ukraine that do not inspire fear.
2533	102	"Yes and no. Again, the editor is right, but after the comma you need to add ""but"". Part of the military operation in the north of Ukraine is a blasphemy. It's an unbelievable compromise. But let's remember that the Russian army has two faces. On the one hand, we see reprehensible recklessness as in Chechnya, if not even greater. It is the face of the military that shows grotesque ineptitude. The other face is an efficient machine that wages war in its own way and is a killing machine."
2533	104	What we know for sure is that the Russians have once again shown that their aviation is not even at the level of NATO aviation from 1991. This is one of Russia's weaknesses that has been exposed in the conflict in Ukraine. I myself admit that I was too optimistic when it comes to assessing Russia's air force or its electronic warfare capabilities.
2533	106	It is an army that can suffer terrible defeats, but also an army that has beautiful victories in its DNA. We have to balance it, remember the two sides of the coin. Certainly, this conflict in Ukraine would have looked very different if the Russians had been better prepared. If they had carried out the attack in accordance with their art of war, we would be talking today about completely different events beyond our eastern border. I would recommend far-reaching caution with assessing the actions of the Russian troops at this stage. Let's wait for the dust of battle to settle and the conflict to end.
2533	108	"A lot can still happen. Peace may be concluded in a month, for example, or the Russians will say that they will go into full mobilization of troops with the thought ""what's the harm if we're already dead economically anyway."" The first conclusions should be drawn after the fights are over. This is my opinion as a person who approaches many things rather skeptically and analytically."
2533	110	"Let us remember that what we see is largely a created media message. It's all selling well. Clickbaits pt. ""see how the Russians got stuck in Ukraine"", memes and so on. From my point of view, of course, it looks different. We are witnessing an information war. Besides, let's face it, people with access to secret information usually have such confidentiality clauses on them that they can't talk about many topics. So the most competent people who could give us the most substantive content are simply mute. All the rest are people dealing with the case from the civil side. Therefore, I would be wary of people who claim to be experts. This includes my humble persona. I know as much as I know. I do not have access to top secret information."
2533	112	Information warfare is also a key issue.
2533	114	The way Ukrainians conduct their information campaign will go down in the history books. This is the absolute world championship. And Russia? He uses clumsy Russian propaganda, threatens with nuclear power and refugees coming from abroad. There is no finesse that the Ukrainians have. Only here the question arises to what extent it is the action of the Ukrainians themselves, and to what extent they are helped by the staff appointed by NATO and companies that deal with such things professionally. Please note how President Zelensky behaves. An ordinary T-shirt, closeness to the nation, media and soldiers, openness. After all, presidential security has to get a cat there.
2533	116	Zelensky is a professional actor. We can laugh that he used to run around in high heels on stage, but we can say that he plays the role that was written for him in a great way. What kind of statesman Zelensky has become is a created media message that is very effective. I have no evidence for this, but I suspect that there is a team of advisers behind it that knows how to build a narrative in the face of war.
2533	118	What do you think is most likely to end this conflict? Most often, three scenarios are mentioned: Russia will achieve the maximum goal (taking over Ukraine, a puppet government in Kiev), the intermediate goal (conquering some part and agreements unfavorable to the Ukrainians), and the minimum goal (Donbass, Crimea). I understand that the assumption that Ukraine is to achieve a great triumph must be treated with the greatest distance.
2533	120	We have limited access to information, so prediction is not easy. I don't want to make any judgments. However, what I can say on the basis of the current situation is that NATO assistance to the Ukrainians will be continuous. And it will rather increase, not decrease. Besides, I can say that the Ukrainian army will definitely not fall apart. If the soldiers surrender somewhere, it's really in a hopeless situation. But for now, we see that it's an army that sounds like brass when struck, not like breaking glass. It is a beautiful army of patriots led by great commanders. I can also say that the share of armored and mechanized troops will continue to dominate. The vision of a hero with a grenade launcher is a propaganda message. In fact, most of the work is done by artillery, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and mechanized infantry.
2533	122	As for the Russians, I believe that with the forces they have now brought into Ukraine, they are not able to win the war. Even assuming that the second roll has already gone into action, I see no chance of success of this operation. And that brings us to three dismal alternatives. The first is general mobilization, which will take about six months. The war will last until the summer, and then the Russians will attack the Ukrainians with fresh and huge forces to tear off the whole of Transdnieper. Regardless of whether Kyiv is conquered or not.
2533	124	The second alternative - both sides will be so tired of the conflict that they will eventually sit down to talk. Only, as I have already mentioned, the key to peace lies in the Russia-Europe relationship. The most important thing for the Russians will be the lifting of Western sanctions. I hope this option will be available.
2533	126	The last scenario, which until recently seemed improbable, is the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. With a clear losing war, there may be a temptation to use this weapon. With such a vision, it will be the end of Europe as we have known it so far. Yes, the Russians will win and occupy most of Ukraine. Oh, right off the bat, their plan wasn't to take over the whole country. The West would remain untouched. Patriots opposing the new government would be expelled there and would work to maintain the economy of the eastern part. The Russians must leave themselves such a buffer.
2533	128	At the same time, I still believe that you need to be very humble to your own ignorance. I am unable to determine the probability of certain events. For the time being, it can be said that the Russian troops are bogged down. They will be able to move on, but I personally don't see any final military resolution on their part. Unless they order total mobilization or play unsportsmanlike. Except that war has nothing to do with sports. The one who is more brutal wins.
2533	130	Oh, there is another alternative - someone shoots Putin. The best version. It can be assumed that Putin will end up like Lavrentiy Beria. In general, looking at history, many Russian rulers were killed or simply died in March. It would be nice to keep the tradition alive. The question is how realistic is that. Looking at what Alexei Navalny, Putin's potential successor, writes, we are dealing with a man with no less neo-imperialist tendencies. This is a similar approach to the vision of Russia in the world. Only for now, he is an oppositionist locked in a gulag. Anyway, we'll see what the future holds. I'm definitely not an optimist. I believe we are in for a long and dirty war, though I very much hope I am wrong.
2533	132	Let's just not see these unsportsmanlike behaviors, although when you look at the use of cluster or thermobaric bombs by the Russians, you can come to the conclusion that no one will stop at anything there.
2533	134	"The problem is that in Russia, no one considers the use of this type of weapon to be unsportsmanlike behavior. For them, this is a situation as if they had to go out to buy rolls from the store and buy two kaiser rolls. For the Russians, it is an abstraction that you can sign a convention decommissioning the cluster bomb. You are showing humanity, and the Russian will think ""okay, we killed a hundred more faster and cheaper."" They look at it that way. Unfortunately."
2533	136	As for the use of nuclear weapons - from what I remember, in Russia there must be a general agreement of three people to use a nuclear weapon. Putin can't just come up with this idea and push the red button. So there's always hope that someone in charge of the whole operation will have a minimum of common sense. Still, I would stay calm. From our perspective, Poles, I would sleep peacefully. The chance that a nuke will fall on us is about a millimeter. And Putin did more for NATO unity in a few days than the entire West did in 30 years. This is also a key aspect of this whole discussion.
2533	138	It will sound very bad, but Poland has already won this conflict politically. It will cut coupons from what is happening in Ukraine. The role of NATO in our country will only grow. The country that lost, regardless of the final result, is of course Russia. They will not build the Soviet Union 2.0 anymore.
2534	1	Speaker of the Duma: The sanctions arsenal of the West is exhausted. Russia can get ahead
2534	3	"Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the State Duma, commenting on the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia, assessed that ""the arsenal of means to stop the development"" of his country has been exhausted."
2534	5	"""Analyzing these, as well as previous decisions of Brussels and Washington, we can say: the arsenal of means to stop the development of our country has been exhausted,"" Volodin wrote on his Telegram channel. The chairman of the Duma stated that by setting new sanctions, ""Western politicians are forced to choose between a bad and a very bad scenario for the economies and citizens of their countries."""
2534	7	“For the Russian Federation, possible losses due to the ban on oil exports to Europe, according to experts, may amount to USD 22 billion a year. However, due to the increase in energy prices caused by sanctions and the reorientation of Russian oil sales to Asian markets, this will be fully compensated, and perhaps even our economy will turn into a positive territory,” continued Volodin.
2534	9	"According to him, Europe, due to record high prices of energy resources, will ""overpay more than EUR 250 billion annually, not counting the additional costs of switching companies to new types of oil."""
2534	11	“Washington is doing everything to ensure that the main burden of implementing the sanctions falls on European countries. It deliberately weakens the economies of EU countries to make them even more dependent on the United States. He wants to rule countries that previously sought greater independence. Now these countries can't even think about it. They have more problems,” wrote Volodin, according to whom “after overcoming all the sanctions, Russia will only get stronger”
2534	14	As part of the sixth package of EU sanctions, a ban on the purchase of oil from Russia delivered to Member States will be introduced within six months, and a ban on the import of petroleum products will be introduced within eight months. It will still be possible to buy Russian oil delivered via pipelines.
2534	16	The sanctions package will also see Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, cut off from the international SWIFT payment system. The same restriction also applies to the Moscow Credit Bank and the Russian Agricultural Bank.
2535	1	Japan announced new sanctions against Russia
2535	3	The Japanese government has decided to extend the sanctions imposed on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine, Jiji Press reported. The new restrictions include: freezing the assets of 141 people, including Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and banning exports to 71 Russian-linked organizations.
2535	5	The list of organizations to which it will no longer be possible to export technologically advanced Japanese products includes Russian scientific institutions and entities associated with the defense industry.
2535	7	Japanese individual sanctions were imposed on high-ranking Russian officials and leaders of separatist armed organizations, republics dependent on Russia in Ukrainian Donbas - the so-called Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics.
2535	9	"New sanctions on Russia. ""We will work to increase the pressure"""
2535	11	We are extremely shocked to see the devastation, the deep humanitarian crisis and the complete destruction of every Ukrainian city that fell victim to Russian aggression, said the chief secretary of the Japanese government, Hirokazu Matsuno.
2535	13	Together with the G7 countries, we will work to increase the pressure on Russia, he added.
2535	15	Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced on Monday after a videoconference of G7 leaders that Japan would gradually withdraw from importing oil from Russia.
2536	1	The US announced a new package of sanctions against Russia
2536	3	US imposes new sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine three Russian TV stations, eight members of the management of Sberbank and 27 members of the management of Gazprombank, the White House reported. In addition, the US will prohibit the benefits of, among others, accounting, legal and financial services for individuals and entities in Russia.
2536	5	The announced sanctions are the result of Sunday's conference of G7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. As announced by the White House, three Russian TV stations will be sanctioned: First Channel Rossiya-1 and NTW. These actions are intended to cut them off from the money of foreign advertisers. US companies will not be allowed to provide accounting, legal and financial services, including company formation services, to any person or entity in Russia.
2536	7	These services have been crucial for Russian companies and elites to build their wealth, thus generating income for Putin's war machine and trying to hide this wealth and evade sanctions, the statement said.
2536	9	The US also introduced visa restrictions for almost 2.6 thousand. Russians and Belarusians, including soldiers from both countries and their families, as well as members of the authorities of the Donbas self-proclaimed republics, who allegedly committed human rights violations and corruption.
2536	11	In addition, the State Department imposed restrictions on eight Russian companies from the maritime transport sector and 69 related ships, while the Treasury Department included the state-owned Moscow Industrial Bank (MIB) and the manufacturer of Orsis sniper rifles, Promtechnologia, on the sanctions list. The restrictions of the Ministry of Finance will also affect eight members of the authorities of Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, and 27 members of the management of Gazprombank.
2538	1	TIME FOR VEGAN CUTLETS
2538	3	Meat ban or end of the world. The choice is yours
2538	5	Do you remember listening to music from cassette tapes, watching VHS movies and snow in winter? In the near future, meat eaters will be able to recall the times of sausage sandwiches, chicken broth and traditional potatoes with pork chop with the same nostalgia. We will have to give them up to save our children from a climate catastrophe.
2538	7	A ban on animal breeding and the sale of meat, and in the near future an increase in VAT on animal products - this is the future that the European Union and Poland can prepare for their citizens. It's a bill for decades of uninhibited consumerism, whether it's in terms of buying ever new products, boldly using fossil fuel-powered means of transport, building the foundations of an energy system on coal, or finally indulging with the contents of dinner plates lavishly covered with meat.
2538	9	The fact that coal-fired power plants emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is obvious to most. So does the fact that the combustion of petrol or diesel leaves a trace in the atmosphere, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide. Fewer people wonder what is the environmental cost of producing a new TV set, computer, furniture or even clothes, and even fewer realize that one of the sectors contributing most to bringing the climate catastrophe closer is agriculture.
2538	11	The Paris Agreement concluded in 2015 set an ambitious vision for the world: developing and implementing solutions to ensure that global warming does not exceed 2 degrees Celsius, thus avoiding the truly drastic effects of climate change. In practice, this has been translated into declarations of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving full neutrality by 2050.
2538	13	The goal is more ambitious than it may seem at first glance, because it requires not only changes in energy and transport, but also remodeling the functioning of the entire civilization. One of the changes that can be expected is the introduction of a ban on animal husbandry and the resulting ban on meat. Experts agree - physics cannot be cheated, the climate revolution will have to go all the way
2538	15	BAN ON THE SALE OF MEAT A RESCUE?
2538	17	Global warming began to be heard more and more at the end of the 20th century, when an increasing number of scientists alarmed about the human-induced increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This results in the systematic accumulation of retaining part of the energy that reaches the Earth, which results in an increasingly pronounced increase in average global temperatures. The top 10 hottest years on record have been recorded over the last 20 years, and records keep breaking: July 2021 was the hottest month on record, and the 439th in a row to record a temperature higher than the 20th century average.
2538	19	It is worth noting that although official records of the prevailing temperatures go back to 1880, scientists, thanks to the analysis of cross-sections of tree trunks, ice cores from the poles and sediments, are able to say with high accuracy that it has not been as hot as it is now for the last 125,000 years.
2538	21	Taking into account the records broken almost year after year, a new, more imaginative term has appeared in circulation: climate catastrophe. It reflects the threat of climate warming a little more vividly, but it makes scientists slightly irritated. This is because it is an emotional coloring of facts, and these speak for themselves and do not need media boosting. This is explained by Anna Sierpińska from the website Naukoklimacie.pl.
2538	23	"Climate change is a broader term than global warming, but they are often used interchangeably in the media. It is better to write about climate change, because we are dealing with changes in the entire climate system of the Earth, i.e. also in precipitation, and not only with the increase in the average temperature of the planet. The term ""climate catastrophe"" is generally not used in science, it is a media term - indicates Sierpińska."
2538	25	Whether we use dry, scientific names or emotional terms, the situation will not get any less serious. The world we know is coming to an end, and we bring the apocalypse closer with every bite of a cutlet, sausage, sausage or kebab.
2538	27	The conclusions of COP26, the 2021 annual climate summit, are inexorable: climate change will not succeed
2538	29	CLIMATE CHANGING LUNCHES
2538	31	"Which sectors of the Polish economy are most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions? In our country, the main culprit is the energy sector, built over the years on the foundations of ""black gold"", i.e. coal."
2538	33	The National Center for Emissions Balancing and Management / Institute for Environmental Protection reported in the data for 2018 that the energy sector is responsible for 82.9 percent of the total national greenhouse gas emissions. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development informed us that agriculture looks like an innocent by comparison.
2538	35	Polish agriculture, according to KOBiZE data, is responsible for about 8 percent of the country's total anthropogenic emissions. In agriculture, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions is nitrous oxide (N2O) and accounts for 79.6 percent of the total anthropogenic emission of this gas. As for the total emission of nitrous oxide from agriculture, 87.4 percent of it comes from land use (nitrogen fertilization), and 12.6 percent from livestock manure management, explains the Ministry of Agriculture.
2538	37	The ministry further explained that methane (CH4) emissions from agriculture account for 29.9 percent of emissions from all domestic sources. In Polish agriculture, the main source of methane emissions is enteric fermentation (89.5 percent) and animal manure management (10.3 percent). When it comes to total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture, calculated in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, the main sources of emissions in 2018 were agricultural soils (46 percent) and enteric fermentation (39.4 percent).
2538	39	"What does this data mean for us and for the world? The climate report of Compassion Polska issued on the occasion of COP26 clearly states: ""Without limiting meat, it simply will not work."" The global contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions is much higher than in Poland, which is the result of the coal-fired energy system. Globally, zero-emission and renewable sources have a larger share in the energy mix. We will have to wait another decade for Polish nuclear power plants that will allow us to close the “sindergarten” of coal-fired units."
2538	41	The Compasion Polska Foundation has calculated that the global food system is responsible for 33 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and as much as 75 percent of agriculture's contribution to climate change is the result of animal husbandry.
2538	43	A better idea of ​​how climate-damaging agriculture is today is provided by other figures: greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector account for 14.5 percent of total global man-made emissions. This is more than directly generated by transport - and Poland has already signed an agreement according to which from 2035 it will no longer be possible to sell cars with an internal combustion engine in our country. Should analogous bans be expected also in the case of meat?
2538	45	Unless global consumption of meat and dairy is reduced, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement will be very difficult. Even if fossil fuel emissions could be halted immediately, current trends in global food systems would prevent the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal from being met and make it more difficult to meet the 2 degrees Celsius goal, Compasion Polska points out.
2538	47	According to the data provided by the foundation, reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products alone could achieve up to 20 percent of the emissions reduction needed to comply with the Paris Agreement. Politicians who are increasingly signaling the possibility of saving the world by introducing a ban on animal husbandry know this. The inevitability of the necessary changes is also becoming increasingly clear to the farmers themselves, who begin to feel like miners counting down the time until the closure of the mines. And they're definitely not happy about it.
2538	49	HIGHER VAT AND BAN ON ANIMAL BREEDING?
2538	51	"Even the almighty Jarosław Kaczyński lost to the farmers in the matter of meat. The famous ""five for animals"", intended to improve welfare in farms and ban cruel and painful ritual slaughter, led to open rebellion in the United Right. Faced with the threat of a split, the PiS president relented and the controversy was almost never heard of again."
2538	53	Five for animals would contribute to reducing the number of livestock thanks to the ban on ritual fighting. Polish breeders export meat from animals killed in this way abroad - a different method of killing would deprive them of such a possibility. The limitation would therefore result from ethical reasons, not climatic ones.
2538	55	"Both cases were taken to the banners by MEP Sylwia Spurek, who with one tweet made some people who like to eat meat boil, proposing ""five for the plant industry"". And in it, she only talked about wanting to ban meat and dairy advertising, not about banning them."
2538	57	"Dr. Sylwia Spurek, legal adviser, former Deputy Ombudsman, currently an MEP and vice-president of the FEMM Committee (the dot after the scientific title is not a mistake, as the MEP uses feminatives), is strongly involved in the fight for animal rights and the promotion of veganism. ""Food conservatives"" see it as evil incarnate for this reason and almost accuse it of crimes against humanity. To find out about it, just read the comments to the proposal to introduce ""five for the plant industry""."
2538	59	Spurek, herself a vegan, calls for systemic reductions in meat consumption. A starting point may be the introduction of a higher VAT rate on animal products, while exempting plant-based meat and dairy alternatives from value added tax.
2538	61	- I proposed a ban on the advertising of animal products. We know about their negative impact on the climate, environment and human health. And people need to start making decisions consciously, not under the influence of meat propaganda. We already protect people from the promotion of cigarettes, alcohol or medicines - explains Sylwia Spurek.
2538	63	"The MEP also called for the introduction of the subject ""knowledge about climate and animal rights"" in schools and kindergartens in order to ""promote responsibility for the planet from an early age, increase children's sensitivity to violations of animal rights and environmental destruction."""
2538	65	A higher tax on meat would make the final price scare away potential buyers and push them into the embrace of a healthier, cheaper and far less damaging plant-based diet. There is something to fight for: Vivera, one of the producers of alternatives to meat, says that eating only plants (and products based on them) for a month saves the lives of 6 animals, reduces CO2 emissions by 62 kilograms and reduces water consumption by 39,000 liters.
2538	67	The European Union will sooner or later rebuild the meat market. The first steps on this road can already be seen, as told to us by Adam Stępień, general director of the Polish Association of Oil Producers.
2538	69	Changes will affect every branch of the economy, but among them - agriculture is unique. It is a sector that is the foundation of the security of the food production chain in Europe, as well as a critical element of the labor market - after all, for example, the processing sector is entirely based on farmers' labor yields. For this reason, agriculture faces not only challenges related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as such, but also those related to adapting to climate change or even greater care for biodiversity - comments Adam Stępień.
2538	71	"These challenges are described in the strategies that complement the European Green Deal: ""From farm to fork"" and ""For biodiversity"". The indicated strategies develop the Green Deal document in detail, therefore one should always look at the ""sum"" of their provisions."
2538	73	Polish farmers are watching the declarations of politicians and the details emerging in the European Green Deal regarding the future of agriculture. Their voice is increasingly often played by Michał Kołodziejczak, the leader of AGROunia, who sees the expected moves of the EU primarily as the effects of lobbyists of large corporations who want to wrest as much of the market as possible from small, local breeders.
2538	75	- Of course, imposing a higher tax on animal production is a misguided idea, because it immediately suggests to consumers that meat is bad, and plant products are better, because they are promoted with a lower tax. It's an operation to hit farmers as big corporations have invested billions in plant-based alternatives to meat. Actions aimed at reducing the consumption of real meat will be associated with a wave of bankruptcies in Polish agriculture, as it is impossible to change its structure in a short time - explains Michał Kołodziejczak.
2538	77	The head of AGROunia added that corporations are lobbying for such solutions, in fact it is only about building a new market and big money. He stated that he supports the trend of localizing the production and sale of products, but does not support how the Green Deal is being established so far. According to Kołodziejczak, these are often contradictory, yet not very well-thought-out slogans that will significantly reduce food production in Poland and lead to the need to rely on imports from other countries where climate and energy restrictions will not apply. - Today we stand on the verge of another transformation, only the one that is coming - unlike the one from the 1990s - must be fair to people and we will watch over it - assured Kołodzieczak.
2538	79	A visit to a large retail chain is enough to see that the plant revolution has already begun. In some supermarkets, vegan and vegetarian products have already gained their own aisle, and in most of them you can find refrigerators where you can easily find plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products. Meat-free bacon or dairy-free blue cheese are just a small part of the entire range.
2538	81	MEATLESS AND MEAT ALTERNATIVES
2538	83	Vegetable alternatives to meat have been known almost since the dawn of civilization. The Chinese have been eating tofu (soybean curd) for centuries, which in the hands of a master can become the equivalent of any meat dish. Seitan, i.e. gluten in pure form, also comes from the Middle Kingdom, from which you can conjure up chops, roasts or burgers.
2538	85	A more modern invention are soy cutlets, also available as granules (meat equivalent).
2538	87	Products based on pea protein, including the famous Beyond Burger, look particularly promising. The taste of the vegetable burger is so similar to the minced cutlet that some vegans are afraid to eat it. And Polish products have a similar recipe and taste.
2538	89	We asked the largest producers of meat products about the reasons for investing in plant-based substitutes. Marcin Bałanda, director of PR and communication at Sokołów SA, made it clear: the company listens to the voices of customers.
2538	91	- Sokołów introduced a line of plant products in 2017, as the first company among the leading producers of the meat industry in Poland. The directions of development and modification of our assortment are always determined by the current needs and expectations of consumers. One of these trends is undoubtedly flexitarianism, i.e. limiting the consumption of animal products - comments Marcin Bałanda.
2538	93	He also pointed out that other changes in the market's needs are also important. - We constantly monitor consumer trends, conduct research and observe how Poles' food preferences change. So we knew that our industry would sooner or later introduce meat substitutes to its offer. According to CBOS, in 2000, 1% of the population admitted not to eat meat. percent of adult Poles, today - over 3 percent. And this trend will deepen - especially in large urban centers, because this is where the percentage of declared vegetarians and vegans is definitely the highest - says Anna Olewnik Mikołajewska.
2538	95	The Olewnik Group does not intend to ignore the needs of the market, as informed by Anna Olewnik Mikołajewska, President of the Management Board. - We constantly monitor consumer trends, conduct research and observe how Poles' food preferences change. So we knew that our industry would sooner or later introduce meat substitutes to its offer. According to CBOS, in 2000, 1% of the population admitted not to eat meat. percent of adult Poles, today - over 3 percent. And this trend will deepen - especially in large urban centers, because this is where the percentage of declared vegetarians and vegans is definitely the highest - says Anna Olewnik Mikołajewska.
2538	97	Thanks to such products, the Olewnik Group not only opens up to new groups of recipients, but also participates in the implementation of the sustainable development strategy. Meat will also pose a threat to meat products. But these are grown as tissue in special plants, not obtained by killing animals.
2538	99	The future is now - meat from the laboratory is now available to people with a sufficiently thick wallet. As time goes on and prices drop, test-tube meat may transform the market completely, providing products free of suffering and killing, with much less environmental impact, and being practically meat rather than a substitute for it.
2538	101	"What kind of vegetarian eats pork chops? - such a question was asked by Kazik in the song ""12 groszy"". Since the release of the hit, the answer to the lyrical subject puzzle has changed significantly."
2538	103	People who prefer a plant-based diet can count on an increasingly richer restaurant offer. Sylwia Spurek, for example, was photographed eating a pork chop in the center of Warsaw. Vegan, of course.
2538	105	The plant-based alternative is available not only in specialized outlets: meatless sandwiches can be ordered, among others, at McDonald's or Burger King. For vegans and vegetarians, the latter are only curiosities, because vegetable burgers are prepared together with meat ones, which makes them lose their raison d'être.
2538	107	Żabka and even Orlen offer vegan hot dogs. As in the case of producers of meat products, there is pure market calculation behind it. The Global Consumer Survey conducted in 2021 showed that in Poland, 7 percent of people aged 18-29 are vegetarians and 1 percent are vegan. According to the 2019 Ariadna Panel survey, 8.4 percent of Poles already live on a plant-based diet.
2538	109	The millions of people who avoid meat for ethical or climate reasons cannot be ignored. Therefore, enterprises follow the voice of consumers' wallets. So it seems that a ban will not be needed to significantly reduce the demand for meat, and thus reduce its production. The young generation, aware of climate challenges, more and more often decides to go vegan or vegetarian.
2538	111	But will we really have to give up raising animals for meat and dairy production? We asked scientists who shared truly apocalyptic visions.
2538	113	ANIMAL FARMING WILL BRING THE APOCALYPSE
2538	115	Never before in history has our planet's climate changed so rapidly. At times, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which has recently broken the 400 ppm barrier, has been higher. It's just that we managed to raise them to such a level in several dozen years, while natural processes take tens of thousands of years.
2538	117	Scientists have already coined the name Anthropocene - a geological epoch whose shape is mainly influenced by human activity. Climate change is still relatively painless in our situation on the globe, but another great extinction of species has already begun. This time, the catastrophe that caused them is people.
2538	119	Anna Sierpińska from the scienceoklimacie.pl website explained what scientific climate models predict. - We will live on another planet. Climate zones will be different elsewhere, the frequency and amount of precipitation will change, vegetation cover will change, the ranges of animals will move, including, for example, insects that carry diseases or crop pests. How different this planet will be and how friendly to people it has been so far depends on our actions - explains Anna Sierpińska.
2538	121	The expert also explained that excessive consumption - constantly buying new things or wasting food - largely drives high emissions in the richer part of the globe, i.e. in Poland (Poland in 2021 ranks 24th in terms of national wealth out of 174 countries according to Credit Suisse). The average European eats 3 times, and the American (USA) 6 times more red meat than is in the dietary recommendations. In addition, ethical questions arise - millions of people in the world do not have their most basic life needs met, such as shelter, access to clean water or the right amount / quality of food, while the smaller part often exploits the planet's resources completely senselessly, e.g. by producing millions of unnecessary , disposable items for entertainment.
2538	123	Climate change is a trap we set for ourselves. We will feel it, among others, in the decline in the availability of food, for which the new climate will prove unlivable. Michał Kołodziejczak from AGROunia admitted, keeping a slight reserve, that the problems affect farmers today.
2538	125	I don't want to link the two topics. First, we see that the weather we are dealing with is getting more and more hostile. On the one hand, we have droughts, on the other hand, we have storms, and on the third, torrential rains that are uncontrollable. The climate is changing, it's different. The weather we have been dealing with for several years is increasingly extreme, we can see that it is starting to change. Of course, we will feel it very strongly, because the crops suffer from it - points out Michał Kołodziejczak.
2538	127	Without abandoning animal husbandry for meat, it will be impossible to achieve the assumed climate neutrality. Politicians, however, are not in a hurry to introduce appropriate laws, which was complained about by Sylwia Spurek.
2538	129	- Instead of progressive decisions and actions, we have debates and marginalization of important issues, just because they are controversial, require courage and involve political risk. In December 2019, the European Parliament announced a climate alarm, but for these two years have we been operating as if in a state of alarm, a state of emergency, a crisis? Spurek asks.
2538	131	The politician added that industrial agriculture, including animal husbandry, is responsible for the climate catastrophe together with coal energy and transport, but we do nothing about it. We know how much the agricultural and dairy industry contributes to the degradation of wildlife, how it destroys biodiversity, and how it can make the lives of people living in the vicinity of factory farms hell. We know that the current model of nutrition contributes to the suffering and death of billions of animals every year. Can we, living in such a system, think about the future of the planet, the future of societies, states and international organizations?
2538	133	Banning meat will be a very difficult political decision, because for a large part of voters the right to choose a diet is a sacred thing that cannot be attacked. Carnivores do not have to worry yet: no one will take their chops from their mouths. Except maybe knowing that every bite brings us closer to the end of the world as we know it.
2539	1	"The right has detected another dangerous ideology in Poland. He wants to fight her with the movie ""Carnivore"""
2539	3	"It is not only ""LGBT ideology"" that threatens Poles. Association Fr. Piotr Skarga, associated with Ordo Iuris, fights another ""immoral ideology that uses the empathy of people of good will and their dormant vigilance to achieve sinister goals."" It's about ""vegetarianism, veganism and the wider animal rights movement."" There is also a Russian trace"
2539	5	"In order to make Poles aware of the threat, the Institute of Social and Religious Education named after Piotr Skarga collects money on the Internet for the production of the film ""Meateater"". According to the published excerpt, the negative hero of the production will be the well-known publicist Szymon Hołownia."
2539	7	Association of Christian Culture them. Fr. Piotr Skarga is an organization founded, among others, by by Arkadiusz Stelmach and Sławomir Olejniczak - both men are also co-founders of the Ordo Iuris Foundation, known in Poland for its radical pro-Catholic activities.
2539	9	"The association runs the internet portal Polonia Christiania - pch24.pl - and that's where the information about the film ""Meateater"" appeared. The aim of this production is to fight the ""anti-Christian and anti-human revolution"", i.e. against... vegetarianism and the animal rights movement."
2539	11	Vegetarianism - anti-Christian revolution
2539	13	“Vegetarianism, veganism and the wider animal rights movement appear to be an innocent activity designed to prevent the needless suffering of creation. Nothing more wrong! It turns out that it is an unethical and immoral ideology that uses the empathy of people of good will, their good hearts and dormant vigilance to achieve sinister goals. Vegan and vegetarian movements, with the help of social engineering, are step by step dismantling social, cultural, economic and religious structures, thus becoming the next installment of the anti-Christian and anti-human revolution. for carrying out the work.
2539	15	The association wants to raise 25,000. PLN and is close to achieving the goal - according to the information on the website (at the time of writing), PLN 22,600 has already been collected.
2539	17	"The director of the film is Piotr Relich, who cooperates with pch24.pl. As reported on the portal, ""in the film ""Carnivore. Enemy number one?« Piotr Relich and his interlocutors extensively discuss the causes and effects, pointing to the dangers of humanizing animals and animalizing people."
2539	19	"Encouraging financial support for the production, it also presented ""a fragment of a meeting recorded by our cameras, during which amazing, untrue and frightening words were spoken."""
2539	21	"As it turns out, it is about ... an author's meeting of Szymon Hołownia, a Polish publicist who, in his books, m.in. writes about Catholicism in a popularizing way. In the years 2007–2012 he was the program director of the religia.tv channel. In 2018, Hołownia released ""Divine Animals""."
2539	23	"As the publisher's review states, ""God did not create animals by accident and is in contact with them all the time."" It is a praise of vegetarianism and veganism, combined with an appeal for respect for animals and care for the Earth."
2539	25	Terrifying Hołownia and materials from the Russian portal
2539	27	"The meeting, a fragment of which is to be included in the film ""Meat Eater"", was devoted to, among others, promotion of this book (held on March 9, 2019 in Krakow). And ""untrue and scary words"" were said by Hołownia himself."
2539	29	Here they are: “I (as a human) got the most, so I have the most responsibility. And I should finally start to draw practical conclusions from this, because the animals I have met in my life will judge me at the final judgment. People and animals. The world will judge me, every creature. The pig I ate, and I must have eaten a dozen of them, was God's creation, each one. He created each of them individually.
2539	31	For the filmmakers, including Catholics, Hołownia's thesis that during the final judgment people will also be judged by animals is terrifying. These words of the publicist almost become the (negative) motto of the entire production.
2539	33	Krystian Kratiuk, editor-in-chief of pch24.pl, addresses future viewers in this way: “Why is it that when I eat what I like, I am called a murderer? Why does someone look at your plate and call us the worst, just because we eat what our parents and grandparents ate?”.
2539	35	"He also explains why the pch24.pl portal took up the production of ""Meat Eaters"": ""We follow various anti-Catholic trends that arise in modern societies."""
2539	37	Hołownia was promoted to the leader of the anti-Catholic revolution
2539	39	"The trailer of the film shows ""drastic"" materials (as they are marked). These are recordings from happenings and performances for the defense of animal rights, mainly foreign ones. Interestingly, a large part of these recordings comes from the RUPTLY portal - which belongs to RT, formerly: Russia Today, a television set up by the Russian government."
2539	41	"The film ""Meateater"" will probably also feature the history of the Polish fur industry - that is, the one that does business in animal husbandry. A year ago, the Sejm wanted to introduce a ban on such breeding, but ultimately the act did not pass."
2539	43	"As can be inferred from the trailer, in ""Carnivores"" breeders will be presented as victims of the animal defense movement."
2539	45	"The European Union as a ""terror apparatus""?"
2539	47	"The initiative to shoot ""Carnivores"" could be considered a minor (and even funny) episode, if not for two facts."
2539	49	Firstly, the environment associated with Ordo Iuris has more and more influence in Poland, so its activities may have a real impact either on Polish law or on social attitudes.
2539	51	"Second: in the spring of this year, the Institute of Social and Religious Education, Fr. Piotr Skarga, associated with the Association of Fr. Skarga and with the Ordo Iuris Foundation, he produced another film - ""The Revolution of Total Freedom"" by Jarosław Mańka."
2539	53	"It premiered in March, was and is shown in many Polish cities. He talks about a ""neo-Marxist, anti-cultural revolution"" that began in the 1960s in the West and continues to this day, and is even ""radicalizing""."
2539	55	"From the materials of PCH24TV, shot during premiere screenings, you can learn that the fruits of this revolution ""have come to eat Anno Domini 2019"", ""it's about how LGBT communities are promoted today"", and ""evil and poison are infiltrated today by institutions, to which the agents of the revolution got."
2539	57	In one of the materials, Krzysztof Karoń, a right-wing publicist, says simply: “Today, this revolution is approaching its next defeat and in order to avoid it, it hastily assembles a terror apparatus. For us, this apparatus is to be the European Union.”
2539	59	In Revolution of Total Freedom, the contemporary movement fighting for equal rights for LGBT people is derived from the hippie revolution of the 1960s. Both that period and current events are presented in a strictly negative perspective, inserting a negative image of the European Union into it.
2539	61	"This film premiered at a time when the subject of LGBT rights, by the decision of PiS, became the thematic axis of the campaign to the European Parliament. It was from that moment that the ""LGBT ideology"" began to be massively perceived by the right as a serious threat in Poland."
2539	63	Are vegetarians and animal rights activists the next target?
2539	65	P.S. Carnivores on the right
2539	66	"In the August (2019) IPSOS survey for OKO.press, when asked what actions the respondents would be willing to take in response to the climate crisis. One option was to ""give up eating meat."" It turned out that vegetarianism has political colors, it was declared among voters:"
2539	68	the left - 30 percent,
2539	69	KO - 22 percent,
2539	70	PSL – 17 percent.
2539	71	Confederation - 18 percent,
2539	72	PiS – only 11 percent.
2539	74	Perhaps Kaczyński's supporters still hear the warnings of Witold Waszczykowski, who, as foreign minister, told a German tabloid in January 2016 such wisdom:
2539	76	“We want to cure our country of some diseases. The previous government implemented a left-wing concept, as if the world had to follow the Marxist model to move in only one direction: towards a mixture of cultures and races, a world of cyclists and vegetarians, which relies only on renewable energy sources and fights all forms of religion.
2539	77	It has nothing to do with traditional Polish values.”
254	1	"Makowski: ""The new wonderful world of veganism. You will either love it or Sylwia Spurek will force you"""
254	3	"I do not understand why many left-wing liberals have an unbearable manner of saving the world by force. Why do they have to add ideology to the often right ideas? They ""know better"" how to live and what to eat. The MEP of Spring, Sylwia Spurek, practices this art on the basis of veganism. Won't you go for it yourself? We'll make the meat more expensive."
254	5	'We need to bring about institutional change, for example by creating new laws (...). We need to make the production of animal products more difficult and more expensive.' With Tobias Leenaert, the author of 'How to create a vegan world' - this is how MEP Sylwia Spurek described a joint photo with the author of the book on Twitter.
254	7	Thus, it unleashed a debate with almost 750 comments, during which it was overwhelmingly criticized by people who did not accept the use of social engineering in the context of food preferences.
254	9	"The problem of Sylwia Spurek herself, however, is that although she met Tobias Leenaert, she probably did not fully understand what his message was about. The book he published has an important, albeit omitted, subtitle: ""Pragmatic Approach"". - The approach of activists has become more pragmatic. We have moved away from the ""all or nothing"" attitude. We focus on small steps, instead of persuading people to go vegan right away - said the author in an interview for the ""Vege"" portal."
254	11	"In the conversation, he emphasized that emphasizing his sacrifices due to veganism, scaring people with radicalism, bidding on whether you are 100 percent. vegan if you wear shoes with animal glue - counterproductive. ""I often say that if someone paid me $100,000. dollars, I would eat meat and donate the money to a pro-animal organization - he added."
254	13	Gestures for show
254	15	"Although his ideas, stripped of the ""flexitarian"" envelope (methods of small steps in switching to a vegan diet), still represent the same unbearable leitmotif that one day the whole world will have to stop eating meat - Leenaert at least knows how to talk about his motivations sensibly. Without puffing up in the quasi-religious rapture and emotionality of a teenager."
254	17	"Meanwhile, most of Sylwia Spurek's activity in this field brings the opposite effect. It discourages veganism and ridicules it. It is worth recalling the photo of sad fries and peppers and complaining that they are feeding badly in the canteen of the European Parliament. Everything, of course, is sprinkled with social-media sauce of rocktivism, i.e. social activity based on hashtags, photos with slogans written on cards and empty gestures that do not change anything in the world, but give their participants a sense of having done a ""good deed""."
254	19	Social hyperactivism
254	21	"I support #Koniecepokiklatkowa, because it's high time to end the suffering of millions of animals in Europe. You can change it too, (...), sign the petition. It's only a minute, and it can mean so much to non-human animals. #GoVegan. ""FIRST, DON'T KILL! Every decent person should protest loudly when animals are harmed and killed, unfortunately killed in the majesty of the law. (...) Every year, hunters kill over 200,000 birds! #don't kill."" ""Today is Great Bee Day. And if we continue to kill them - e.g. using neonicotinoids (labelled here by the Ministry of Agriculture) - then we will soon be celebrating Bee Remembrance Day :(""."
254	23	"This is the standard ""ecological"" message of the MEP, who, although she promotes the author talking about the method of small steps and a pragmatic approach to the promotion of veganism, leaves no doubt that she prefers radical measures. As for me, remaining in the animal nomenclature, a mole robot. No one likes - and this is probably what unites us beyond divisions - when the other side, instead of discussing, prefers to impose something contrary to social feelings. The future of climate, ecology and the humane treatment of animals deserve more from us than hitting our heads with sticks and fighting for the moral palm of priority."
2540	1	Politicians and corporations in Davos persuade us to a world without meat. It's supposed to be much better
2540	3	Eliminating meat from your diet is good for us and the planet. The first burgers made entirely from plants and tasting like beef can already be tried. Soon there will be more quasi-meat products: plant-based steaks, bacon, fish, chicken ...
2540	5	Agriculture, largely based on traditional farming and crop production, contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions than cars, trains and planes combined. It uses huge amounts of water for this. We eat unhealthy and waste 40-45 percent. food.
2540	7	A significant part of what we produce remains in the fields, because we do not have access to preservatives, infrastructure or simply the harvest does not meet the expectations of consumers. On the other hand, 800 million people suffer from hunger. And this number will grow.
2540	9	It is estimated that more than 9 billion people will need to be fed by 2050. And that means we need a food revolution!
2540	11	"– There is so much talk today about global warming and environmental degradation. And on the topic of food and the challenges that the system generates, we are silent. Meanwhile, governments, organizations and business should intensively cooperate to solve this problem - there is no doubt Paul Bulcke, CEO of Nestle S.A., one of the participants in the discussion ""On the menu: sustainable and nutritious food"" during the World Economic Forum Davos 2018."
2540	13	Plant meat
2540	15	What is needed for a food revolution? The world loves meat. Much of the farming is based on livestock, which consumes a quarter of the world's fresh water.
2540	17	“If we just eat less meat, the system will become more efficient. We also have a greater opportunity to tackle hunger, argues Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International.
2540	19	And encourages to change the system towards the creation of ecological farms, which not only have a better impact on the environment, but also provide jobs for the local community.
2540	21	Importantly, such farms should supply food companies.
2540	23	Patrick Brown, an American biochemist, founder of Immposible Foods, whose flagship product is a burger made entirely from plants, goes even further and asks what really attracts us to meat?
2540	25	- After all, it's not about eating an animal, but about the taste and smell. We need to find a better way to produce meat,” he says.
2540	27	He calls the current technology prehistoric, absurd and harmful to the environment. – We are able to produce tastier and more nutritious food and thus ensure global food security – he assures.
2540	29	Burgers from Impossible Foods contain heme - a group of enzymes that can be found in plants and animals, and which is responsible for the transport of oxygen inside the body. The other ingredients are wheat protein and coconut oil.
2540	31	A world without meat? It's possible!
2540	33	If, as a consumer who needs protein, I find an alternative, I will be happy to try it, says Mariam Mohammed Saeed Hareb Al Mehairi, Minister of Food Security of the United Arab Emirates.
2540	35	Patrick Brown argues that the production of food with the same nutritional values ​​is possible. You don't have to make any compromises.
2540	37	In 50 years, a large part of the protein in the human diet will probably come from plant organisms, says the minister.
2540	39	Is this the diet of the future? We'll soon find out.
2541	1	More and more Poles limit the consumption of meat. Thanks to the young generations
2541	3	An increasing number of Poles reduce or completely give up meat consumption; the observed trends are largely due to the younger generations, according to the analysis of the Polish Economic Institute.
2541	5	"PIE analysts pointed out that ""like the rest of Europe, Poles are increasingly limiting or completely giving up meat consumption."""
2541	7	"According to experts, the observed trends ""are largely due to the younger generations."" Experts, referring to the data from the Global Consumer Survey of 2021, indicated that in Poland 7 percent. of people aged 18-29 are vegetarians, and 1 percent. vegans, ""which collectively is a higher result than, for example, in France or Italy"" - it was stated."
2541	9	As indicated by the 2019 Ariadna Panel survey, the percentage of Poles on a vegetarian or vegan diet reaches 8.4%. On the other hand, according to Maczfit's research on residents of large cities cited by experts, the scale of popularity of vegetarianism in such centers can reach as much as 20 percent. In 2014, in the CBOS survey, the percentage of vegetarians in Poland was 1%.
2541	11	"At the same time - according to the Ariadna Panel - half of vegetarians in Poland are 34 years old or younger. ""The results of the Mintel survey from 2017 showed that in the 16-24 and 25-34 age groups, the percentage of vegans and vegetarians exceeds even 10 percent."" - noticed."
2541	13	The leadership of young people can also be seen in reducing meat consumption - even every fifth person aged 18-24 did not eat meat throughout the month, with values ​​close to 10%. in older cohorts, PIE said based on Ariadna's data analysis. On the other hand, according to the IBRIS survey, more than half of Poles plan to reduce meat consumption.
2541	15	"Europe, according to pre-pandemic data, was the largest market for meat replacement products - the Old Land accounted for nearly 40 percent. global sales of its substitutes - indicated in the analysis published in the latest issue of ""Tygodnik Gospodarczy PIE"". Experts pointed out that Poland is ""quickly catching up in this regard"" - in the last three years, meat sales in our country decreased by 7.5 percent, and the sale of vegetarian meat substitutes increased by 480 percent. The vegetarian part of the restaurant industry is developing similarly. ""Happy Cow, a global guide to restaurants for vegans, in 2010 had nearly 1,200 fully vegan or vegetarian restaurants in its database in Europe, and in 2019 it was almost 6.5 thousand."" - emphasized. It was added that in their ranking of the best cities for vegans, Warsaw is in sixth place, behind such metropolises as London, Berlin or New York - in our capital, Happy Cow found 150 restaurants that favor a plant-based diet."
2541	17	"Analysts made a reservation that the dynamics of changes in meat consumption is not so visible in the Central Statistical Office data. In the so-called In the inflation basket, created on the basis of research on household budget spending, the weight assigned to meat products in 2021 significantly increased compared to 2020, ""to a level not recorded in the previous decade"". This situation, as they admitted, is a reversal of a clear downward trend recorded continuously since 2014. In turn, according to data collected in 2019, meat deliveries to the domestic market decreased by 3.9 percent yoy."
2541	19	The authors of the analysis concluded that meat consumption in 2019 decreased by just over 2 percent, and the pig population - depending on the type of animal - has remained at a similar level or even slightly increased in recent years. It was added that the production of animals for slaughter in 2019 decreased y/y for the first time since 2013 (PAP)
2542	1	"Over a hundred coronavirus infections linked to one bar. ""Dangerous Wave"" in Beijing"
2542	3	"A total of 166 coronavirus infections in China have been linked to a single bar in the capital Beijing, officials said. A government spokesman described the outbreak as ""dangerous"" and everyone in the area will be tested."
2542	5	"By international standards, the number of reported infections in Beijing is low but high by China's standards, the BBC wrote. The ""zero COVID"" policy still applies there. Infected people are quarantined or hospitalized."
2542	7	All residents in the area where one of the bars in the central district of Chaoyang is located, with 166 infections linked to it, will be tested for three days.
2542	9	Two residential buildings closed
2542	11	Two apartment buildings in Chaoyang, home to hundreds of people, were closed on Sunday after a positive test was reported there, an employee of the housing committee told Reuters. Some townspeople added that they had received a text message telling them to report to the local authorities if they had recently visited the bar.
2542	13	Officials said most children would not return to school in the capital next week as originally planned.
2542	15	Since April 22, Beijing has recorded - according to official data - 1,997 cases of coronavirus infection.
2542	17	In early June, Shanghai, the economic center of China and world trade, eased its lockdown after two months of strict lockdown due to a wave of infections with the Omicron variant coronavirus. However, on Saturday, the local authorities began mass COVID-19 testing of almost all 25 million residents. In some districts, people are once again unable to leave their homes. New infections detected and another round of testing spark fears that the citywide lockdown could return.
2543	1	New coronavirus discovered in Sweden. Do we have anything to fear?
2543	3	Swedish scientists have identified a new coronavirus spreading among small field mammals of the hamster family. The pathogen named Grimsö virus is not a cause for concern, but the situation may change in a few generations of mutations - as was the case with SARS-CoV-2.
2543	5	The new coronavirus was tracked down by scientists at the Zoonoz Science Center at Uppsala University on the basis of studies of about 260 common voles in the vicinity of Grimsö. Genetic studies have confirmed that this virus is well established in the vole population, and details can be read in the journal Viruses.
2543	7	Prof. Åke Lundkvist, virologist and head of the Zoonoz Science Center at Uppsala University, says:
2543	9	Between 2015 and 2017, we consistently found what we called Grimsö virus, which would suggest that the virus is widespread and common in common voles in Sweden.
2543	11	What is the Grimsö virus?
2543	13	Zoonoses is a term for zoonotic diseases that gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, of course, is a zoonotic virus, transferred to humans from bats. Viruses that for a long time circulated only among animals can become dangerous to humans by infecting their bodies. The zoonotic potential of a given pathogen depends on many factors, including climate, geographical location, population density, sanitation, etc.
2543	15	Scientists from the Zoonoz Science Center at Uppsala University are trying to monitor any potential dangers to humans from animals on an ongoing basis. Unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originated in bats, seasonal coronaviruses - such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 - spread to humans from rodents such as rats, mice and voles. Scientists have no doubt that there are still many viruses in nature, some of them certainly with epidemic potential.
2543	17	Swedish scientists examined common voles from around Grimsö and tested them for the presence of coronaviruses. Using RNA sequencing, scientists tracked down the new coronavirus, which was tentatively dubbed Grimsö virus. It belongs to the betacoronavirus family, which also includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
2543	19	At the moment, there is no threat to people from the Grimsö virus, but the situation is dynamic. Rodents are carriers of several pathogens with zoonotic potential, such as hantaviruses and tularemia-causing bacteria. In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of infectious diseases transmitted by small mammals (such as rodents).
2543	21	Prof. Åke Lundkvist concludes:
2543	23	We still do not know what potential public health risks the Grimsö virus may pose. However, based on our observations and previous coronaviruses identified in common voles, there are good reasons to continue monitoring coronaviruses in wild rodents.
2544	1	"The ""Chinese virus"" - from a conspiracy theory to a serious hypothesis"
2544	3	More than a year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still do not know what the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is. For many months, the main suspect was the famous bat from Wuhan, and theories about the virus escaping from a Chinese laboratory were considered frivolous, but now the narrative around the case has changed. Does the disease through which the world is changing its face originate from a laboratory in Wuhan?
2544	5	"TRUMP AND THE ""CHINESE VIRUS"""
2544	7	In the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic, many wondered where the new coronavirus, causing much fear around the world, came from. The most talked about the animal origin of SARS-COV-2 - we all know jokes about bat soup, which was supposed to be the beginning of the pandemic. However, some suggested that the presence of the laboratory of the Institute of Virology in Wuhan is not accidental - the then US President Donald Trump was among this group. He propagated claims that the virus had at least accidentally escaped the control of Chinese scientists, claiming that he had seen irrefutable evidence of the laboratory origin of the pathogen. This, like many of Trump's statements, was met with a sharp reaction from the mainstream media. There was talk of spreading misinformation, inducing fear, interfering with the global fight against the coronavirus, harmfully stoking stereotypes and racism. There are many indications that the Trump administration actually did not have strong enough evidence to talk about certainty. The background of these events is presented in an article by the authors of Politico.com [1]. Strictly political issues should also not be forgotten – both the rivalry between the US and China, as well as the problems of Trump, who wanted to divert attention from his own failures in the fight against COVID-19 by making accusations against China.
2544	9	JOE BIDEN AND THE CHANGE OF NARRATIVE
2544	11	"On May 26, 2021, President Biden stated that he was uncertain about the origin of the coronavirus, with both a natural origin hypothesis and a laboratory leak likely. He also said he had ordered US intelligence to investigate the matter thoroughly within 90 days. As befits a polarized world, the reactions of the pro-Biden media were completely different from the year before. The ""conspiracy theory"" has become a ""serious hypothesis"" being considered by the WHO and the G7. Facebook's policy is particularly telling - before Joe Biden's declaration, posts about the creation of the SARS-COV-2 virus in laboratory conditions were blocked or their ranges were limited, while a few hours after the American leader's statement, such entries were no longer considered disinformation [2]. The issue of the independence of scientists and their positions on the origin of COVID-19 seems particularly disturbing - in an interview with NBC, Alina Chan from Harvard pointed out that during the presidency of Donald Trump, scientists were afraid to publicly say that the virus could have been created in a Wuhan laboratory, because in At that time, being associated with a controversial politician was very frowned upon [3]."
2544	13	WHERE IS THE TRUTH?
2544	15	"The hypothesis of the natural origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in the first months of the pandemic, gained wide support from the scientific community. In February 2020, The Lancet published a letter from 27 scientists condemning the theory of the laboratory origin of the coronavirus. Similar positions were taken by the WHO or the Committee on Immunology and Etiology of Human Infections of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The topic is also described in an article published in Nature Medicine, whose authors base their claims on the analysis of the structure of the virus. The zoonotic evolution of the coronavirus is evidenced, among others, by the structure of the virus spike protein and the lack of traces of interference in the pathogen genome [4]. According to research, SARS-CoV-2 shares 97% similarity with other coronaviruses found in bats. It is also uncertain whether the first cases of the disease occurred in Wuhan, where the ""suspicious"" laboratory is located, and the facility itself has a high level of security, so an accidental leak of the virus should not take place."
2544	17	The theory of the laboratory origin of the virus also has its supporters among scientists and some WHO employees. They point out, among other things, the very inaccurate investigation of the World Health Organization - the team investigating the laboratory in Wuhan spent only a few hours there and did not have full access to the data. Suspicions are also raised by the fact that 3 employees of the Institute of Virology in Wuhan showed symptoms of coronavirus disease more than a month before the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 - but it is not certain whether they did not suffer from influenza.
2544	19	It's hard to disagree with the Director-General of WHO that the respect that the victims of the pandemic deserve, it is necessary to know the origin of this virus in order to prevent such a situation from happening again. May it be possible to reach the full truth as soon as possible, despite political pressure and polarization surrounding the topic.
2547	1	Yes, vaccination makes sense, even if the virus mutates
2547	3	You asked us if it makes sense to continue vaccinating if the virus continues to mutate and new strains appear, such as British or Brazilian. The truth is: just because new variants are emerging doesn't mean that all of them will affect vaccine effectiveness (in fact, most variants don't). When this happens, preparations can be adjusted so that they do not lose their effectiveness.
2547	5	"The mutation of the virus is natural. SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, does this constantly, because certain errors occur during the replication of its own genetic material. Adelaida Sarukhan, an immunologist at Barcelona's Institute of Global Health (ISGlobal), told Verificat: ""Mutations can occur randomly in any of the 30,000 nucleotides that make up the virus genome."""
2547	7	"In the case of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, mutations are quite common. According to various estimates, they happen about twice a month. As the researcher points out, hundreds of variants of the virus have been described, the vast majority of which are harmless, although some actually cause concern. These are varieties belonging to the VoC (Variant of Concern) category: ""B1.1.7, described in Great Britain, B1.351 described in South Africa, P.1 (in Brazil), Indian variant and other two, identified in California and New York have a similar protein mutation. It is responsible for their greater aggressiveness, mortality and the ability to bypass the body's natural immunity or immunity acquired thanks to the vaccine."
2547	9	Indian variant
2547	11	"As Sarukhan notes, ""clinical trials and large-scale vaccination, i.e. administration of preparations to hundreds of millions of people around the world, are proof that vaccines are very effective in protecting against a serious course of the disease, even in people infected with new varieties."" For the Indian variant, ""so far there is no evidence that it reduces the effectiveness of vaccines,"" concludes Sarukhan. She cites a study not yet reviewed by peer-reviewed journals showing that both Covishield and Covaxin ""continue to show efficacy in neutralizing the Indian variant."" The study highlights that ""there is a slight decrease in neutralizing activity,"" which means that higher levels of antibodies are needed to fight this strain of the virus."
2547	13	Vaccine manufacturers are working on alternatives to fight emerging strains of the virus that could break the effectiveness of vaccines. The development of new preparations to adapt them to new strains of the virus is by no means new or extraordinary. For example, flu vaccines have to be modified every year as the old ones lose their usefulness.
2548	1	Frontex: There were much fewer refugees than reported by the Border Guard
2548	3	The Border Guard reported that over 39,000 people tried to cross the Polish-Belarus border illegally last year. third-country nationals. It's not true.
2548	5	Push-backs on the Polish-Belarusian border are still underway. This means that the Border Guard, using provisions that, according to the Ombudsman, are incompatible with treaties and human rights, pushes refugees back to the border.
2548	7	At the same time, the Border Guard in its communication exaggerates the scale of migration on this border. And that's many times.
2548	8	Huge discrepancies in the data
2548	10	In January, a message was published on the website of the Border Guard, according to which 39,697 third-country nationals tried to cross the Polish-Belarusian border last year. These data are noteworthy because according to the data of Frontex - the EU agency dealing with the external borders of the EU and allied countries - only 8,099 third-country nationals crossed all eastern land borders of the Union in 2021, except for border crossings. That is five times less.
2548	12	When informing about the situation on the eastern land border of the EU - and this is what Frontex data says - we mean over 6 thousand. km line connecting the borders of Norway (not in the EU, but cooperates with Frontex), Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova. The Polish-Belarusian border is only a small part of it.
2548	14	A large difference in the figures reported by Frontex and the Border Guard could mean that the Border Guard was very effective in stopping illegal crossings. But I asked both institutions to explain this discrepancy and it turned out that the matter is something else - something that may be either a mistake or simply a lie.
2548	15	As counted by the Border Guard
2548	17	When I asked Frontex where the discrepancy came from - after all, Frontex draws data from institutions in individual Member States, so they cannot differ from national data - they replied that the Border Guard does not provide the number of people, but the number of attempts to cross the border. The Frontex spokesman referred me to the SG for further clarification.
2548	19	Talks with the Border Guard were difficult because p.o. Lt. Anna Michalska gave contradictory information. Finally, however, I received an answer to my questions in writing.
2548	21	When stating the number of 39,697 people, the Border Guard did not mean the number of specific people (although it wrote in the communiqué that it was the number of citizens). It was the number of attempts to cross the border outside border crossings. What is meant by this term? According to the explanations of the Border Guard, this number includes, for example, activities where someone was standing on the Belarusian side of the border and was warned by Polish border guards that he was not allowed to cross it, so he left. Such an attempt counts towards the harvest even if that person has not yet set foot on the boundary.
2548	23	As the Border Guard spokeswoman explained to me, such cases could involve groups of many people.
2548	25	When members of such groups dispersed and attempted to cross the border in smaller groups, they were counted again. When they were, in accordance with the law and regulations adopted by the PiS government, incompatible with the treaties and human rights, sent back to the border, and then tried again, they were again attempts.
2548	27	"A spokeswoman for the Border Guard informs that the ""wandering groups"", such as the one we saw on the recordings made available by the Border Guard from Kuźnica, and people trying to force the border, were not counted."
2548	28	Let's count on an example
2548	30	Imagine a group of 20 migrants. It's not that much - reports from activists and the words of the border guards themselves indicate that these numbers used to be much higher.
2548	32	Our imaginary group approaches the border, but is still on the Belarusian side. The Border Guard warns them that they cannot cross the border. The migrants are dispersing and the Border Guard records 20 illegal attempts to cross the border.
2548	34	"This is confirmed by the statement of the Border Guard spokeswoman: ""If people approached the border line and, after warnings from Polish patrols, resigned from crossing, they were also counted"" - she wrote in an e-mail."
2548	36	Let's imagine that after this failed attempt (the migrants had not been to the border yet, so they were at most trying to try), the members of this group divided into smaller groups of several people and tried separately. Refugees and activists talk about such a strategy. Border Patrol catches everyone and adds 20 tries again. 40 attempts have already been made from 20 people.
2548	38	"The fact that the Border Guard counted the attempts in this way is confirmed by a message from the Border Guard spokeswoman: ""if a person tried to cross more than once, the next attempt was counted separately""."
2548	40	We know from the reports of refugees that in many cases they tried to cross the border 4-5 times. If members of our example group did this, 20 people would have grown to 100-120 people.
2548	42	This is the difference between counting citizens and counting trials. Trial counting is also statistically important. However, it should be made clear that the numbers quoted are the numbers of the trials and not the numbers of citizens or persons. The interchangeable use of these terms - which was done by the Border Guard on its website - is either a mistake or a deliberate lie.
2548	43	How many refugees really were on the Polish-Belarusian border
2548	45	I asked the Border Guard about the citizenship of the people who were detained by border guards in 2021. I asked for data in the form of tables so that I could analyze them myself. However, I received (despite repeated requests) only a short fragment of the text:
2548	47	“In 2021, after crossing the green border with Belarus, the Border Guard detained 2,744 migrants, mainly foreigners. Iraq (1,557), Afghanistan (447), Syria (269), Russia (69), Somalia (68), Iran (55), Turkey (54) and Tajikistan (51) and other nationalities (single nationalities)'.
2548	49	"A spokeswoman for the Border Guard explained that only those persons who, after contacting the officers, ""went to guarded or open centers or were transferred by the Border Guard to open houses run by foundations and associations"" are treated as detained. This means that this number does not include people affected by push-backs, i.e. sent back to the border with Belarus."
2548	51	Therefore, we do not know how many people actually tried to cross the Polish-Belarusian border outside the border crossings. There were at least 2,777 of them (so many people were detained by the Border Guard and transferred to the centres). At most – 8099 (this is what Frontex gives for the entire eastern border).
2548	53	There is, of course, a chance that there were more of these people. Because not all of the officers could see. It is certain, however, that the number of attempts at illegal crossings, given on the Border Guard website as the number of citizens, is untrue. The real numbers of people with whom the Border Guard had contact last year at the border crossing with Belarus are much less spectacular. And it is less suitable to support the thesis promoted by politicians of the ruling party that we had to deal with a dangerous onslaught of foreigners on the Polish-Belarusian border.
255	1	Emmanuel Macron: Morawiecki interferes in the elections in France
255	3	"French President Emmanuel Macron accused Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of interfering in the election campaign in France. He also responded to the criticism of the Polish authorities regarding contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He described it as ""baseless"" and ""scandalous"". In an interview with TF1 television, the French president accused the Polish prime minister of repeatedly meeting his main competitor for the presidency, Marine Le Pen. As he stated, these meetings were in support of her ambitions on the French political scene. These remarks are both unfounded and scandalous, but they do not surprise me – he said about the criticism of his telephone conversations with Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. “You don't argue with criminals. Criminals must be fought. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot? Morawiecki asked. I fully assume that several years ago, on behalf of France, I was constantly talking to the Russian president in order to avoid war and build a new architecture of peace in Europe,” Macron defended himself. He explained that he was talking to Putin about obtaining a ceasefire, a humanitarian truce, as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other European leaders do. ""I think it's my duty, without complacency and without naivety,"" he told TF1. The presidential election in France will take place on Sunday, April 10. Polls so far show that the favorites to enter the second round are Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. The incumbent president can count on 25-27 percent. votes, and his competitor for 23-20 percent."
255	4	In the second round, Macron is still the favorite in the polls, but his advantage over Le Pen has started to melt away. In mid-March, research showed that he could count on over 60 percent. votes. Currently, support for him has fallen below 55 percent.
255	5	"The potential electorate of Marine Le Pen is growing, according to a Kantar Public poll for the daily ""Le Figaro"". 38 percent The French do not rule out voting for Le Pen, and 39 percent. on Macron. Over 20 percent French people still do not know whom to vote for. However, the potential electorate is not the hard electorate of a given candidate. They may vote for that person under certain conditions."
2550	1	Dr. Bogusław Rogalski: The visit of Macron, Scholz, Draghi in Kiev is a cynical Piarist of the heads of state who, over the years, have bred and insolent Putin with their policy of collaborating with Russia
2550	3	Behind the scenes, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi are pressuring Ukraine to make concessions to Moscow; they want a peaceful solution that will be most profitable for the West.
2550	5	For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, their visit to Kiev may turn out to be a prelude to a nightmare, comments the daily Die Welt. – The visit of Macron, Scholz, Draghi in Kiev is a cynical Piarist of the heads of state who, over the years, have bred and emboldened Putin with their policy of collaboration with Russia – this is how the president of the Union of Christian Families, an expert on international affairs, Dr. Bogusław Rogalski commented on the visit of European politicians to Kiev. – Our country has already provided over EUR 2.4 billion in various types of aid, and is also a European leader in the supply of weapons to the front, according to the May report of the World Economy Institute in Kiel. Importantly, this amount does not include the costs related to the reception of over 3 million refugees. Poland is also the runner-up when it comes to arms supplies to Ukraine. Only the United States sends more armaments to the front (around EUR 3 billion). Military equipment worth about EUR 1.5 billion has already arrived from the Vistula to the East. Macron, Scholz, Draghi's visit to Kiev is in fact a stubborn pursuit of the appeasement policy known from history, i.e. just as Czechoslovakia was cut short in 1938, so today France, Germany and Italy want to cut Ukraine from the territory occupied by the army since February 24 Putin. The visit itself, however, is a PR element for the citizens of France, Germany and Italy, indicating the alleged involvement of their authorities in helping Ukraine. The symbol of help for Ukraine from Germany is the famous five thousand helmets. This help still does not go beyond helmets, used rocket launchers from the 1980s or vehicles produced during the Cold War from deep salvage - tells us Dr. Bogusław Rogalski.
2550	9	For the Ukrainian president, this visit was (...) pleasant. It may (although) be more of a prelude to a nightmare.”
2550	11	"– thinks Christoph B. Schiltz from ""Die Welt""."
2550	13	The European “troika” (Scholz, Macron, Draghi) is “the core of the new coalition of +realpoliticians+ in the Ukrainian war. They are in favor of a pragmatic, quick and – at least from the Western perspective – the most cost-effective peace solution. They do not advocate justice, greater security in Europe, the defense of freedom and the fundamental principles of international law.
2550	15	– assesses the publicist.
2550	17	"According to the author, ""there are many indications"" that Zelensky's guests ""served the Ukrainian president pleasures, but behind closed doors they urged him to start negotiations with Russia in the coming months, after the expected collapse of the Donbass in eastern Ukraine, and to work on a peace agreement."" Schiltz points out that ""Italy already outlined a peace plan three weeks ago and is increasing its pace."""
2551	1	Poland must save Ukraine from the fate of the Revolution's feeding ground [OPINIA]
2551	3	It is not known whether Ukraine has any real chance of joining the European Union; many experts point out that, due to the interests of, among others, Germany and France, this will never happen. Despite this, Kyiv turns out to be ready to destroy elements of the Christian order in order to maintain its EU perspective. If this continues, our eastern neighbors may soon turn the country into a real feeding ground for the world revolution. Poland should make every effort to prevent this from happening.
2551	5	In 2011, Ukraine signed the Istanbul Convention, a document which, in theory, is supposed to protect people exposed to domestic violence, but which in fact is a revolutionary buzzword introducing LGBT rhetoric into the legal order. Despite signing the Convention, the Ukrainians did not decide to ratify the document for many years; without it it could not come into force. The outbreak of the war changed everything in this regard. According to unofficial information provided by the Ukrainian media, without the ratification of the Convention, Ukraine would not be able to obtain the status of a candidate to the European Union. It was probably in the hope of obtaining this status that President Volodymyr Zelensky last week submitted a draft ratification of the Convention to the Verkhovna Rada.
2551	7	"On Monday, the Verkhovna Rada ratified it: 259 deputies of the Ukrainian parliament voted ""for"" and only eight voted ""against"". This shows that the adoption of the Istanbul Convention was indeed seen as a sine qua non condition for obtaining the promise of granting Ukraine candidate status to the European Union."
2551	9	"I will not decide here whether Ukrainian politicians really believe that their country will really be admitted to the EU one day, or rather they just want to seduce voters with such a prospect; I also leave aside the belief clearly behind the desire to join the EU that it has some power to ""deter"" Russia and thus increase the chances of survival of Ukrainian statehood. The decisions of Ukrainians, motivated by fear, may be irrational. However, it is clear that some forces intend to use the ongoing war to push Ukraine in the direction of an anti-Christian Revolution. Perhaps Brussels itself instructed Kiev to ratify the Convention. It is also possible that the government in Kiev, which is after all associated with liberals from the United States, decided to use the chaos of war to carry out this change without provoking much public resistance."
2551	11	"The revolutionary forces operate in the Ukrainian issue not only through leading politicians, but also through various organizations, nominally ""grassroots"" but in fact simply the street arm of great social engineers. An example is an event that was planned… in Warsaw. On June 25, a homosexual parade bringing together both Poles and Ukrainians is to pass through the streets of the Polish capital. The thing is called ""Warsaw & Kiyv Pride marching for peace"". This ""gay pride parade"" takes place in Poland, because, as the organizers explain, due to the war, it cannot be held in Kiev ""in the traditional format"". That is why rainbow circles intend to march in Warsaw - for ""peace"", which they understand as freedom of sexual expression in the spirit of LGBT ideology."
2551	13	"The revolution, however, encounters resistance. He was almost absent from the Ukrainian parliament, where the Istanbul Convention was adopted by an overwhelming majority. However, not everyone likes the homosexual Polish-Ukrainian parade in Warsaw. For example, the Ukrainian movement ""Everyone together"" protested against her organization, which fights against the promotion of murdering unborn children and the LGBT ideology. The movement issued an appeal to President Andrzej Duda, asking him to stop the parade; as indicated, Poland did not host war refugees from Ukraine so that some of them would now act together with the Polish revolutionary activist for the overthrow of the constitutional order in force in the Republic of Poland."
2551	15	"And after all, this is what promoting the LGBT ideology aimed at the family is, which is the absolute foundation of the national existence and thus also the foundation of the state's survival. In its appeal, the “All Together” movement also pointed out that the LGBT ideology actually has common intellectual and spiritual roots with Russian communism. Today, this is rarely remembered, but it is the most honest truth: the LGBT community is only one element of the entire offensive of the ideologues of new Marxism. Just as the old Marxism used workers to destroy Christian civilization, its contemporary version reaches for the so-called ""sexual minorities"" and other groups, but aiming at the same thing: a fundamental reconstruction of the world so that societies would be ruled by an atheistic, totalitarian regime."
2551	17	Both the adoption of the Istanbul Convention and the Warsaw Polish-Ukrainian homosexual parade are just two examples of how the globalist Revolution is trying to remodel Ukraine. We have already written about the plans of the creators of the new world order towards Ukraine many times in PCh24.pl; even before the war, Ukraine was perceived by many as a perfect field for social engineering experiments, as evidenced by, for example, the extremely widespread in this country child trafficking, carried out, among others, for the needs of homosexual deviants from all over the West.
2552	3	The case of Ukrainian nationalists in Poland is gaining momentum. The problem of refugees from Ukraine is acute throughout Europe, but especially in Poland, both because of historical relations and geography.
2552	5	"It started with placing Ukrainian flags on state institutions (both together with and instead of the Polish one), on central squares and even on monuments and cemeteries. Aggressive Ukrainian refugees running and screaming, as well as crowds of ""sympathisers"" or those who just want to shout for any reason, can now be found almost all over the world. The Ukrainian issue is now so boring for economically depressed European citizens that clashes, fights and sometimes murders of native citizens and the so-called Ukrainian refugees are on the agenda."
2552	7	We are not cruel either and we understand that it is possible and necessary to help our neighbors in need. The elderly, women and children fleeing the atrocities of war must be helped. But if Poland is overrun by aggressive nationalist Russophobes who, instead of building a peaceful life on our land, conduct aggressive actions and speeches and treat Poles and our traditions in an ugly way just because they may have different views - this is cause for reflection.
2552	9	Ukrainian nationalism, if you go deeper into history, has always been a convergence point between the interests of Poland and Ukraine. This is extreme Nazism in its worst manifestations, which does not tolerate concessions and diplomatic solutions. Ukrainian nationalism, since before the murderer Stepan Bandera, preached intolerance towards Poles, impossibility of making concessions and aggressive, even murderous and terror-based solution to all problems. The Ukrainian nation, according to all the canons of Ukrainian nationalism, is a chosen nation, which has similar characteristics to German Nazi Nazism. By the way, yesterday, June 20, 2022, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church canonized the murderer of thousands of Poles, Stepan Bandera. So now the ideological inspirer of Ukrainian nationalism is sacred! (Duda would kneel)
2552	11	Over time, many Nazi ideas in Europe gradually disappeared, succumbing to the ideas of common sense, only Ukrainian nationalism did not. To this day, our eastern neighbors faithfully believe in their chosenness, in the lack of value of human life, in one value - the spread of Ukrainian nationalism in the world, and above all in Poland, which, despite help, Ukrainians have always considered an enemy.
2552	13	And given the loyal attitude of our government towards refugees from Ukraine, there is no need to wait long for Banderist propaganda and then for the introduction of Banderist ideology. The process of changing history has already begun, according to PiS, Poles must be more loyal and tolerant, they must abandon historical memory and ask Ukrainians for forgiveness for Volhynia! And also to erase this page from the history of our country.
2552	15	If this continues, our government, to please the United States, Great Britain or anyone else, will sell Poland to Ukraine and destroy our statehood and our national idea. So, it's time to act!
2553	1	Jerzy Kwaśniewski: The end of Poland and the Union as we know it?
2553	3	"The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced in Warsaw the approval of the Polish National Reconstruction Plan (KPO). The politician stressed that EU money will not flow to Poland if it does not implement the agreed ""Milestones"" in an exemplary manner. We are facing new taxes on combustion vehicles, fees for the use of expressways or contributions to civil law contracts. The Union is also shaping the Supreme Court for us, demanding that all cases of the Disciplinary Chamber be reconsidered - even those obviously ""non-political"", such as theft or violation of bodily integrity by judges. The EU even dictates to Poland how to change the rules of procedure of the Sejm."
2553	5	However, with the increasing pressure of Brussels on EU member states, the resistance of European nations to the centralization of management of the Union and manual control of the economy and even the culture of nation states is growing. Ordo Iuris experts immediately began to reveal the activities of EU bureaucrats. Subsequent analyses, speeches and articles increase social resistance and create pressure that gives the government a base to oppose the dictates of the European Commission.
2553	7	"Resistance is all the more necessary as the ""Milestones"" directly oblige Poland to implement gender policy in culture, art, television and theatre. And the European Parliament claims that each area of ​​""Milestones"" is to take into account ""gender budgeting"". It is probably obvious that the plan to rebuild Europe is becoming before our eyes a plan for the ideological colonization of recalcitrant states."
2553	9	Money from the Reconstruction Fund will therefore continue to be used to put pressure on Poland in order to transfer powers to EU authorities in new areas, centralize the economy or implement ideological programs in workplaces, schools, art and culture. The European Commission is fully aware that the tight budget of Poland - involved in helping Ukraine and refugees - will not survive the refusal to pay KPO funds. Blackmail becomes an ordinary method of contact between Brussels and Warsaw.
2553	11	"At the same time, the EU is starting to implement the project of formal reconstruction of the EU into a federation limiting the voice of individual states. The ""Conference on the Future of Europe"" (CoFoE) serves to increase the powers of EU bodies, which, by creating the appearance of social consultations, is to convince that Europeans themselves - including Poles - want the importance of the European Commission, the European Parliament and even the establishment of joint transnational electoral lists."
2553	13	"In response to a serious threat to Poland's sovereignty, we are preparing a legal commentary on the content of the ""Milestones"" and the entire KPO. In this way, we strengthen social resistance to the attempt to take control over the internal policies of the Member States by non-elected EU bodies."
2553	15	"We are also working on a comprehensive report on the recommendations of the ""Conference on the Future of Europe"". We will show that instead of federalizing the Union and marginalizing national governments, the reform of the community should aim at strengthening the position of nation states. In order to embolden Polish politicians and equip them with the best arguments to defend national interests, we will hand over the document to MEPs and organize an international debate in Brussels devoted to this important issue."
2553	17	We continue to monitor the work of the European Parliament and the European Commission to be able to react quickly to any threat to Polish interests. We are also continuing proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union, in which we are fighting for the annulment of two resolutions that violate the good name of our homeland and the Ordo Iuris Institute itself.
2553	19	Only our experts have enough knowledge, experience and independence to substantively and reliably oppose the harmful dictates of the European Commission. Introducing our arguments into the public debate will provide effective pressure and support for the government that needs to negotiate with Brussels.
2553	21	If today we do not strongly oppose the construction of a centralized European superstate based on ideological assumptions, Poland and the Union as we know it will soon come to an end. In their place, a centralized political behemoth will be born, fueled by radical ideologies and economic utopias.
2554	1	Jan Wudkowski: Poland, inspire! Civilization elements of reforms for Ukraine
2554	3	The end of military operations against Ukraine will not mean the end of the conflict with Russia. The historian Feliks Koneczny described the rivalry of various civilizational principles in Eastern Europe. This unique analysis from a few decades ago can still help us understand the ideological motives of the Russian invasion, as well as provide inspiration for the development of a post-war model of development for Ukraine. With the history window wide open, I would like to bring the reader closer to Koneczny's perspective. I will present elements of reforms that could consolidate Ukraine's turn towards the West.
2554	7	The establishment of new relations with Russia by the EU and the Anglo-Saxon countries, as well as the phase of reconstruction of Ukraine, which is still far away, will cover a complex of dimensions: political, military and economic. In the commentary, I will focus on references to cultural and religious specificity, which was brilliantly read by prof. Necessary for Eastern Europe.
2554	11	The Polish public debate on post-war relations between Kyiv and Warsaw (for example Marek Budzisz's emotionally arousing article about the possibility of a federation of the two states in the future) focuses on the rhetoric of the balance of power in Europe, which is determined by military, territorial and economic resources. In my opinion, the discussion is complemented by the civilizational and cultural foundations. As proved by prof. Necessary, they are of great importance. I will try to argue - giving the theoretical background in four short parts - that lasting peace in Eastern Europe would be contributed to by the mental and cultural changes that lasted for years. The strategy of introducing civilizational reforms could also be the basis for post-war cooperation between Ukraine and Poland.
2554	15	Koneczny's legacy
2554	19	A historian from Kraków, over several dozen years of work, he created an original comparative science of civilizations, an important step towards which was his habilitation in the history of Eastern Europe (in 1920). The contribution of the Polish academic lecturer differs from the vision of Samuel Huntington or how Russian thinkers themselves see their Eurasian or Pan-Slavic civilizational role (Jabłoński, 2014).
2554	23	"Koneczny defined civilization as ""a method of organizing social life"". It includes e.g. ethical principles, legal system, separation of powers, economic relations. Civilization affects the content and depth of culture. On the other hand, the form of culture - architectural style, folklore, cuisine, or the alphabet used - do not predominate about civilization affiliation."
2554	27	The scholar pointed to the rivalry of several civilizations in Europe, primarily the Turanian, Byzantine and Latin. He popularized the greatness and ethical primacy of the latter, Western European, which - drawing on Greek philosophy, Roman law and Christian ethics - is, according to Koneczny, a long-term fruit of the activity of the Catholic Church.
2554	31	"Various civilizational influences in ""Russian Mir"""
2554	35	"Prof. Koneczny described the dominant method of organizing social life in Russia as the Turanian civilization. The name comes from the Persian word ""turan"", which was used to describe the region of Central Asia - the Great Steppe. The main features of the archetype of the Turanian civilization are: militarism of social organization and statehood based on private law, which can be understood as public institutions, and in principle also society, are treated as a kind of property of an absolute ruler, e.g. a khan or a tsar. Koneczny's observations help to explain, for example, the practice of Russia's foreign policy, the aim of which, in opposition to Western countries, does not have to be the national interest."
2554	39	The historian argued that competing ideological influences had clashed on the Volga River for centuries. The Russian Empire, however, remains an alien civilizational pole to the West. His skeleton turned out to be more durable than e.g. the ideology of communism.
2554	43	"The scientist from Krakow consistently emphasized that there are civilizational differences between Ruthenians and Ruthenians. Kievan Rus, the Cossack Hetmanate or contemporary Ukraine are examples where a mentality different from the Russian one, and thus a method of organizing social life, was emphasized. The decisive and extremely united reaction of Ukrainians to the neighbor's aggression in 2022 shows that the concept of the ""Russian mir"" (de facto imperial doctrine) disregards the harsh civilizational realities of the region."
2554	47	The importance of the moral and religious dimension for the future of Ukraine
2554	51	“Eastern societies are being reborn in general only through religion,” concluded a researcher of the history of this part of Europe (Koneczny, p. 275). The scientist noticed that never did Eastern societies recover from a moral decline other than after first reforming their religious organization.
2554	55	"In Ukraine, tectonic changes are taking place in the structure of the Orthodox Church, although it is still difficult to predict what doctrinal and social consequences they will bring. Until recently, there was a division into three Orthodox Churches (including one ""pro-Moscow""), to which most Christians in the country belong. In the landmark year of 2019, two church institutions merged to form the united Orthodox Church of Ukraine (PKU). The situation during the war accelerated dramatically. Hundreds of communities (parishes) and thousands of faithful leave the structures recognizing the supremacy of the Moscow Patriarchate and join PKU. The process is complex (Górny, 2022) and also encounters resistance from clergy faithful to Moscow and agents of Kremlin influence."
2554	57	The clergy in Ukraine, along with severing ties with Moscow, should be given greater autonomy from the secular authorities. Such autonomy is characteristic of the Latin civilization, and impossible in the Turanian (the phenomenon can be attributed to the justification in Revelation - the clergy must above all be faithful to God's law).
2554	61	Could Poland contribute, in accordance with Koneczny's guidelines, to support moral and religious changes in our neighbor? It seems that the arrival of millions of refugees to our country has already captured the hearts of Ukrainians and prompts deeper reflection on the source of this phenomenon. Outside the area of ​​Latin civilization, it is hard to witness such a scale of solidarity of ordinary people, including parishes.
2554	65	Poland has advantages that it could offer its neighbor when it comes to Christian ethics. (And this despite the crisis of faith and values ​​that is also swelling in our country). I will focus on the example of protecting the conceived life. This dimension, if only because of the demographics (Ukraine's population decreased by several million after the collapse of the USSR) or the psychological consequences for mothers and fathers (the so-called post-abortion syndrome), should be of fundamental importance for the Ukrainian elites. Changes in Polish legislation to protect the unborn life and the organic pro-life movement in our country - the strongest in Europe - can be a genuine role model for Ukrainians and the local clergy (although maintaining the admissibility of abortion in the case of rape in Polish regulations took its revenge during the turmoil of war).
2554	69	"The adopted volume of the article allowed the reader to be interested in how religion and ethics fundamentally affect civilization. Further Thoughts, Prof. Dr. Ewa Kurek or Robert Tekiela, see the attached items in the bibliography for those interested, show that the peculiar perception of God and theological issues in Russian Orthodoxy contribute to the consolidation of the ""herd"" mentality, as Koneczny called it (as opposed to Catholic personalism)."
2554	73	Europeanization of Russia through Ukraine?
2554	77	"In this part of the commentary, I would like to briefly discuss the thesis, supporting it with quotes from Koneczny's ""History of Russia"", that Kievan Rus has a special civilizational impact on the Russian empire. Ukraine, on the other hand, remains sensitive to Polish and Western ideas. The thesis of an ideological intermediary to Europeanize Russia seems fundamentally important to consider. There are many indications that an even greater challenge than a favorable or at least acceptable military resolution of the war for Ukrainian society will be the issue of defending peace after its end."
2554	81	"If Ukraine, despite the great difficulties of its location, developed an attractive civilizational model in the reconstruction phase, the Kremlin elites will watch with great attention the actions of Kiev - the ""mother of all Russian cities"". This is due to the fact that the power of a strong, also imperial autocrat, is a civilizational method that can be effective with large own resources. However, it does not work in itself when Russia needs to find a way to rejuvenate morality, improve demographics and solve the material problems of ordinary families.of. Koneczny noted that on various occasions the Russians had considerable difficulty in understanding foreign thought: Western European concepts, derived without the mediation of Southern Ruthenia, or even Poland, dizzy and caused disorganization (Koneczny, p. 249). At present, in times of great cultural crisis in the transatlantic world, explaining the advantages offered by the principles of the ""rotten West"" is a particular challenge. It seems that the Ukrainian elites should be the predestined translator to show what good flows from the foundations of the Latin civilization."
2554	85	The cultural revival in the Turanian civilization could only effectively come from the same source from which it had sprung in the past: from southern Ruthenia. (...) Direct Polish influence was excluded for religious reasons, and the cultural gulf was too great anyway (Koneczny, p. 151). Of course, the social situation to which Koneczny referred when analyzing relations in the mid-seventeenth century will be significantly different from the present one. The secularized Russia of the 21st century, boasting about the legacy of the USSR, tries to despise the Ukrainians, treating their culture as inferior. However, the key to the Europeanization of the Russian soul should still be sought, which is inevitably associated with denying the false narrative, which is exposed, for example, by the facts on the front and the heroic attitude of Ukrainian soldiers. Work in the field of history, religion and ethics, and the development of Ukrainian culture (which should also be supported among refugees) is important here in the long term.
2554	89	The need for organizational and intellectual effort
2554	93	As a result of the military invasion, there was an unprecedented potential for civilizational changes in Ukraine. Kyiv has shown that it has autosteering elites (earlier ones were exterminated, among others, as a result of communist purges), whose behavior commands respect in most of the world's salons. There is also an accelerated retreat from Russian culture on the Dnieper, creating an ideological vacuum. Great expectations, energy and spirit of sacrifice were ignited in the ideologically cementing Ukrainian nation.
2554	97	There is a favorable atmosphere for broad talks about the post-war period, because the governments and institutions of our countries have become aware of a certain unity in the dimension of the security architecture of the region. Ukraine has been granted candidate status for EU membership, and integration processes should also be considered in a broader European context.
2554	101	If the Ukrainian elites agreed that the adoption of elements of Latin civilization serves the good of their nation, and these principles entered into strategic thinking, it will be a much more durable basis for cooperation in the area of ​​the so-called Intermarium, than democratically changing politicians or beautiful gestures of decision makers, such as the decision of the mayor of Lviv to unveil stone lions at the Eaglets Cemetery.
2554	105	Poland could get involved in promoting the understanding of Koneczny's civilization abroad, drawing on the talents of our great historians (for which a special team could be appointed). Foreign activity should be preceded by contacts with Ukrainians, listening openly to their voice on many issues, as well as to the thoughts of scientists who constructively polemicize with Koneczny.
2554	109	Fortunately, the historian's works have already been translated into English, but the challenge remains to reach the public with his message in Anglo-Saxon countries and the European Union, including the Three Seas Initiative. This would allow the international public to see the possible elements of building peace in our part of the continent.
2554	113	The promotion of Koneczny's scientific achievements, as postulated in the commentary, as well as being inspired by it during discussions on the post-war model of Ukraine's development, seem to be a very big task (also demanding attempts at internal reforms in our country, if Poles are to be authentic preachers of these ideas).
2554	117	However, the external situation, i.e. the specter of World War III, may be conducive to the decision-makers of the West not interfering with the ideological shaping of the Intermarium order by the people of the region. There is no certainty here, considering the emerging differences of interests and the strong influence of various ideologies on politicians, but there is a providential chance.
2554	121	I would like to leave the reader with a question: can Poland desert its dusty civilizing mission in the East? I believe that failure to make efforts to Europeanize Russia is not only pusillanimity, but also a great risk. As many experts argue, the Russian Federation will push for another, even bigger conflict in a few years, seeing Poland as the keystone of the balance of power in the region. The “Latinization” of Ukraine, referring to Koneczny’s guidelines, may be a key stage in ensuring civilizational peace in our part of the continent, which will radiate further to the east.
2554	125	I would like to end my comment by referring to a religious perspective. John Paul II understood it well and was able to draw conclusions from it during the Cold War. Christians, strengthened by the act of consecration of Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary made in March, should remain in unshakeable hope that they are not alone in the fight for good and truth.
2555	1	Macron, Scholz, Draghi and Iohannis on a visit (international tour) to Ukraine. There's nothing like another day at the theater.
2555	3	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met on Thursday (June 16, 2022) in Kiev with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. Officially, this international meeting was an expression of European leaders' solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.
2555	5	"Dear Readers, this eloquent image of Emmanuel Macron kissing the pope is a very powerful image that makes you shudder, as one thinks of Satan whispering into his victim's ear before he ""bites and devours"" them. I have exactly the same feeling when I look at Macron, who with such an ""evil smile"" moves to the face of Ukrainian President Zelensky, and Zelensky looks like he likes it very much."
2555	7	"The ""funny thing"" about this war in Ukraine is that it seems to be very ""visitors"" friendly, it is certainly unprecedented in all of history as we know it. Look, Bono and U2 can come and tour while the bombs are falling, Nancy Pelosi and her minions can come and go as they please, so are many ""stars and starlets of modern times."""
2555	9	"And now Emmanuel Macron (among other things to boost his ratings) spins around as if he owns all of Ukraine. Don't get me wrong, because people in Ukraine are dying and we are dealing with a great tragedy, great suffering and basically we don't know what awaits us in the future and to what possible escalation there may be, BUT these ""international VIP trips"" to the country covered by war and their ""inviolability"", this ""ubiquitous fun"", it is indeed very strange. Ah… There's nothing like another day at the theater, don't you think?"
2555	11	“Macron, Scholz and Draghi, representing Europe's three largest economies, traveled together to Kiev on a special overnight train provided by the Ukrainian authorities. President Klaus Iohannis of Romania - which borders Ukraine and has been a key destination for refugees - arrived on a separate train.
2555	13	The meeting with Zelensky is of great symbolic importance, given that Western European powers face criticism for not providing Ukraine with the weapons that Kyiv asked for.
2555	15	The Times of Israel reports.
2555	17	"Another thing worth noting is that Emmanuel Macron, in response to a question about his earlier remarks that Russia must not be humiliated, said: ""France has been next to Ukraine since day one."" The ""international outing"" visit comes as Russian forces increasingly push for an offensive in eastern Donbass, slowly but steadily gaining the upper hand over poorly manned and armed Ukrainian forces."
2555	19	However, not many hours have passed since the end of the visit of Macron and his companions in Ukraine, and the media began to spread information that the real purpose of the visit was to persuade Ukraine to surrender and give Russia what it demanded from from the very beginning. The difference, however, is that at the beginning it was enough to give back the already lost Crimea and the so-called rebel republics.
2555	21	"Today, however, it is necessary to give back Crimea, these so-called rebel republics, which occupy parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, so that Ukraine will lose its access to the sea, which in turn will lead to the collapse of this country. And, of course, let us not forget the thousands of innocent victims, that is women, mothers, wives, fathers, men and children. And the fundamental question arises: ""Was it worth fighting with Russia if Germany and France were on Putin's side from the very beginning?"""
2555	23	"Ukraine could not win this war and will not win it. And if you can't fight like a lion, fight like a fox. Unfortunately, Ukraine succumbed to numerous promptings and went to this war, bringing the whole country to ruin and losing much more than it could gain. I recall once again the words of John Paul II: ""in war there are no winners and vanquished, there are only dead people."" I also renew my appeal to the Polish rulers, so Poland is the first to help but the last to enter the war!"
2557	1	They bare their fangs again
2557	3	"End of the story? After all, everything is already settled, the world is divided into spheres of influence and nothing can change it? This is Fukuyama's 1992 mindset, and unfortunately popular. It was similar before. Maybe it's worth ""taking a look"" at least at the last 100 years?"
2557	5	"The fact that the white man ""civilized"" the ""savages"" and ""by the way"" exploited in a completely uncivilized way, earned money seemed obvious and unchangeable. Most of the ""enlightened"" wallowed with delight in unlimited and thoughtless sybaritism."
2557	7	"Germany had been cooperating with Russia for many years and everyone, apart from Poles, was happy. Such a great success - dividing a huge, populous country between them, which for each of them was a dangerous competition with this freedom that no one - apart from Poles - needed. And for Germans and Russians, the most important thing is ""order"", i.e. one ruler who decides about everything - including other people's lives. Sometimes only taking into account the opinions of the ""enlightened"". Who among the ""civilized"" Europeans could agree to the free election of a king? After all, the famous Volter as ""Professor Bourdillon"" already in 1767 wrote in ""Writings Against Poles"" that Poland was ""the sick man of Europe""."
2557	9	Interestingly, Voltaire received the materials for the text from the Russian ambassador in The Hague, Alexander Vorontsov, as well as money. The king of Prussia contributed from his purse. Someone once said that prostitution is not a profession, but a character and I have an irresistible impression that he was right.
2557	11	It is known that France is after all Liberté, Égalité and Fraternité means Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. But without exaggeration. This did not apply to slaves in the colonies and, of course, to Poles who were still disobedient and backward in Catholicism. Let the Germans and the tsar take upon themselves this “burden” of civilizing the Poles by dividing their country between them. And there will be order. Only the Poles kept rebelling, not wanting to forget about their lost freedom.
2557	13	"But the Germans were not satisfied, they had so few colonies, and yet they ""owed"" more. Of course, the ""guilty"" was the countries that had more of them, but did not want to give up."
2557	15	The outbreak of the war, later called the great one, took everyone by surprise. This time Russia acted against Germany, perhaps so that it would not grow too strong, becoming a threat.
2557	17	"The effect is known - Germany was winning in the west, and without the intervention of the US and other Anglo-Saxon countries, it probably would have won. In the East, the Bolsheviks seemed a temporary aberration. It was only their expedition west to the recently resurrected Poland and the pogrom they suffered at the hands of Poles that changed the ""puzzle"" in Europe. Also the postulate of US President Wilson about the right to self-determination of nations and the creation of many nation-states."
2557	19	"Again, many thought that after such great destruction and the murder of millions of people, there would be peace for many years. But the Germans could not accept defeat. After all, they ""deserve"" more. Germany was ""wronged"". In the peace treaty, apart from reparations for France, they were forbidden, for example, to own tanks."
2557	21	"The way out was to establish cooperation with a well-known eastern friend, although with a new name of the USSR. The Rapallo Treaty of 1922 is a military-economic arrangement that gave Germany the opportunity to build and train tanks and obtain cheap raw materials, and Russia access to technology. The error from 1914 has been fixed. The ""great"" powers ignored the agreement. This encouraged Germany to increase its demands and, as a result, in the Munich Agreement of 1938, the “great powers” ​​agreed to annex part of Czechoslovakia to the German Third Reich in order to preserve peace. We already know that the aggressor's appetite cannot be satisfied by concessions. So what if at someone else's expense, because as we know, ""appetite grows with eating"". Poland did not give in to German demands, knowing that it would only encourage escalation. Germany and Russia needed a common border, and they agreed upon it when they invaded and occupied Poland in 1939. Already without any obstacles, Russian raw materials were transported to Hitler's Germany, helping in the attack on Western Europe. It seemed that such mutually beneficial Russian-German cooperation would last for a long time."
2557	23	"We know that it was different and that it was another strategic mistake of Germany. Again, the cooperation of the Anglo-Saxons crushed the whims of the Germans - the second war was lost. Again, huge destruction and millions of victims. After a second solid hit between the eyes with a club, even an idiot will draw conclusions what not to do to avoid it. Germans are not fools. In an economic or military clash, Germany will always lose to the Anglo-Saxon coalition. But in cooperation with Russia? The current one has always been beneficial for both parties. In Russia, from the time of the reign of the Mongols Genghis Khan through successive tsars, man was only a slave, enjoying the grace of the master - the owner of the state. But a rabbi who could have his own slaves and derive some kind of contentment and pleasure from it. As one of the Russian poets wrote - ""I am a slave, but the king of the universe"" - a bit exaggerated, but they will never run out of desire."
2557	25	This can be used. Germany gives technology, Russia millions of slaves and soldiers to conquer, and cheap raw materials. So?
2557	27	February 12, 2007 to be exact - it was only 15 years ago in Munich (again!) that the new Tsar of Russia, Putin, rejected the post-Cold War European security architecture. Clearly and without ambiguity. But like Hitler, almost no one believed it.
2557	29	"Someone who warned was at least a ""zoological Russophobe"". There was a popular one who was described in the German press as ""Chancellor Merkel finds him cheap and easy to breed"". In Russian it was written ""our man in Warsaw"". Does anyone remember this? And who are we talking about?"
2557	31	The Hitler-Stalin Pact (called Ribbentrop-Molotov) enabled Germany to attack Poland and later the rest of Europe. Without the intervention of the Anglo-Saxons, it might have stayed that way for a long time.
2557	33	"The Merkel-Putin pact was supposed to facilitate the introduction of the ""Russian mir"" in Ukraine, and the German ""bestellen"" - order in Europe. Russia without Ukraine will never be a superpower, and it knows it. He will do everything possible to make it happen. ""Car"" does not hide it at all."
2557	35	"Germany also makes no secret of its ""patronage"" of the whole of Europe with France as junior partner. Previously, German tanks and soldiers turned out to be too few. What to do to build the Fourth Reich? Instead of physical strength, ""use a stratagem"" as Mr. Zagłoba used to say."
2557	37	"This time, we should simply make other countries dependent on each other, for example in terms of energy. Preferably, of course, under the undoubtedly noble slogan of ""saving the world"" from the greenhouse effect. Europe emits as much as 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of burning coal and other minerals in power plants, gas should be burned (it is not a mineral and does not give the greenhouse effect?). Gas should be imported from friendly Russia - they have capital for armaments. We will distribute to other European countries and make money on it. The others will be able to choose - obedience or no deliveries. As in a ""real"" democracy, everyone has a choice."
2557	39	Russia will be able to do what she likes best - use troops against the disobedient. They too will have a choice - obedience or death and destruction.
2557	41	"In Russia, they always said ""we have a lot of people (a lot)."" Who counts how many tens of thousands will die, who remembers the millions deported to Siberia, death and suffering - these are just statistics. The Russian army is the only one that uses a German invention, i.e. crematoriums, this time mobile (car)."
2557	43	"Maybe it's worth using the knowledge known for about 2500 years. The Art of War (""Sun Tzu"") is a Chinese war study written in the 6th century BC by Sun Zi. Does the strategy described there have any relevance now? We are already in the 21st century."
2557	45	How to conquer a neighboring kingdom with little effort? The recommendations are very simple. Intimidate part of the population, the more the better. Convince that all resistance is impossible and will only bring cruel revenge. That it's better to give up and save your life and at least some of your fortune than to lose everything. It's best to use the local elite for this, bribe some of them, promise new and greater privileges from the new ruler. Whether they get them is another matter, what matters is that they believe. Expenses will pay back many times after you get it anyway. Intimidate others with murder. The submissive will only lose some of their wealth, but will keep their lives.
2557	47	Genghis Khan, for example, successfully implemented it. After conquering the first settlement or city, he had most of them slaughtered, leaving a small part alive and releasing it. They later spread the news of what had happened to them and each subsequent city or settlement mostly surrendered without a fight. If not acted mercilessly again as before. In a relatively short time, the very sight of Khan's troops caused panic and surrender without a fight.
2557	49	"In order for the Germans to be able to ""steer"" an already united Europe in the form of a federation or with any other label, it is necessary to neutralize the most ""rebellious element"". The UK had had enough of the unbridled and brazen arrogance of the EU bureaucracy and left the EU. Of the larger countries, Poland remained defiant. A financial variant was used for part of the local ""elite"". Who remembers the so-called ""Moscow loan""? As Paweł Piskorski wrote and said, his Liberal Democratic Congress was founded with the money of the German CDU brought in suitcases. Later, the KLD pupated and his party gained power. The new Prime Minister of the Polish Government was “cheap and easy for Chancellor Merkel to breed”. As the ""King of Europe"", he also earned their favours. He actually made money and set an example for other similar scumbags. There are also other ways. No one carries money in suitcases anymore. There are paid lectures, publications carried out by not only German but also Russian foundations, e.g. Gazprom. And after the end of the term of political power, the functions of directors in various companies or foundations, but to get them you have to ""deserve"". Other ""willing"" see only that it will pay off for them - as once Voltaire or Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. You just need to have the ""right"" character. Journalists are also looking for money - someone pays, so they write as they are told. There are all kinds of ""authorities"", actresses and actors paid by the hour, writers and other ""celebrities"" who call themselves doupiage."
2557	51	"That's why everyone has something called common sense so as not to be ""rolled over"", or ""fooled out"" or ""hacked out in the attic"". Especially since their attempts are quite primitive and easy to recognize. Ashamed to admit a mistake? Even greater to abide in it."
2557	53	Everything was going great, but suddenly in 2015, the German-Russian lackey in Poland lost power. Instead of liquidating the army, they began to invest in new equipment and increase the size of the army.
2557	55	"Suddenly (?) On February 24, 2022, the werewolf from the east bared his fangs again and the Merkel plan - Putin after 30 years in a spectacular and very tangible way ""took it in the head""."
2557	57	As the Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin said, the German ministers said - you are not worth helping because in three days you will lose (was that the agreed plan?). Ukraine has been defending itself for over 3 months. The fights are fierce. Brave and heroic Ukrainians. Ruthenian soldiers, as always, criminal and thieving.
2557	59	Ukraine fights not only for its own independence, but also for other countries, including Poland. The Russian werewolf does not hide that after winning in Ukraine - God willing - it will never happen, Poland will be next.
2557	61	We must arm ourselves, and we do, but we need time to shop - military equipment must be produced and soldiers must be trained. It costs, but less than the occupation we know all too well.
2557	63	Again, as in the case of the world wars, the support of the Anglo-Saxon coalition is essential. They drew conclusions. Better to send weapons and other equipment than soldiers. Ukraine can put up even a MILLION army, but they need a lot of good weapons and time to train the soldiers. Then they will win.
2557	65	"Poland does what it can, sends weapons, trains soldiers. Germany and France provide verbal support. They publicly say not to humiliate Russia. So what - Ukraine is about to surrender? Then they can go back to doing business with Russia? It is completely irrelevant that on the other side of ""business"" there will be criminals, mass genocides and thieves? What about the European values ​​that Poland has been taught about for years? Is the example of Voltaire still valid? What about the Ukrainians if they lose? You know. Those who will be able to flee to the West will do so on an even larger scale, perhaps even several million. Siberia will accept even several million. Several million will be murdered, the survivors will become slaves and conscripts to the new army attacking Western Europe."
2557	67	It's hard to negotiate with a criminal. How about someone new? What if it was the well-known oppositionist Navalny?
2557	69	"Oh yes. Even the Anglo-Saxons would accept it, and for the Germans and French it would be a godsend. So what if Navalny does not hide the fact that he is an imperialist no worse than Putin, that he would also like Russia to border the country with which he wants to border. Again a ""great"" opportunity to do business - money for armaments to Russia, cheap gas and oil to Germany. Dream."
2557	71	Navalny differs from Putin — only and exclusively — in his attitude to corruption. Navalny wants to fight her to have more money for weapons. Putin allows, as in Gogol's play The Inspector, anyone can steal, but BY RANK.
2557	73	However, I'd rather the Russians spend as much as possible on yachts, properties, cars and other crap than on guns.
2557	75	"Of course, not all Russians are the ""missing link in the theory of human evolution."" They are honest and very brave, like the members of the now banned MEMORIAL. It's just that there are very few of them and they have either left Russia, are in prison, or are dead"
2557	77	Poland has already accepted over 3 MILLION mainly women and children, men are needed in Ukraine. What support have we received from the EU? Turkey received approx. EUR 6 BILLION from the EU to help refugees, Poland 0 (in words, zero). We will have another debate about non-compliance with the rule of law where — in Russia? But not in Poland. The insolence of the German-led (and maybe also financed by the Russians) Eurocrats is so great that they found our Constitutional Tribunal to be incompatible with EU law!
2557	79	What's next? Maybe the result of the elections in which Law and Justice will win will also be considered illegal? Maybe this is not the end yet, to finally get what they want, German tanks will send, and if there are not enough of them, they will ask the Russian satrap for support? Nothing can be ruled out anymore. For its maniacal sense of superiority, Germany has already sacrificed many millions of people, a few more are just statistics.
2557	81	"If necessary, the Court (I don't know why) of Justice of the EU will intervene. Judges, appointed by politicians, are exempt from any evaluation. They can meet in France or elsewhere in chateaux and other properties priced from 10,000 euros a night and more with anyone, sponsors, EU officials, and nothing to do with anyone? The French press wrote about it, there was supposed to be a sequel, but it hasn't happened yet. All costs related to the work of EU TS are classified, it is not known how much they earn. No one checks whether they have other income because it would be questioning independence and independence. ""Undermining and attempting"" - for which in the People's Republic of Poland one could count even several years behind bars. Maybe this will also happen in the EU, after all, plebs are supposed to listen to and follow the instructions of the ""enlightened"", not to ask and demand something."
2557	83	"The plan to subjugate Ukraine to the Ruthenian barbarians fell through the will of the Ukrainians. The plan of subordinating Poland to EU officials quite ""accidentally"" from Germany is still being implemented with great support from Polish deputies and various other local paid ""enlightened"". It will fall by the will of Poles. The Germans already ruled all of Europe, and they lost. The Germans want to rule all of Europe again, and they will lose again."
2557	85	In 1920, Poland fought the Ruthenian degenerates alone. We have knocked out the fangs of the beast from the east. We will never forget the supplies of ammunition from Hungary or the support from France (what would it be like now?) and the participation of American volunteer airmen. At that time, Ukrainian soldiers under the command of ataman Petliura also fought on our side. It is a pity that there were so few of them, if Ukrainians had fought for their freedom in large numbers, they could have won a free Ukraine.
2557	87	We know that the imperial ambitions of the werewolves of Germany and Russia will last a long time. So we have a long fight ahead of us. They keep baring their fangs. WE WILL WIN!
256	3	"The Ukrainian constitution states that Ukraine's natural resources are the property of the nation. This has been pointed out many times by the critics of the takeover of natural gas, hard coal and ore deposits by a narrow circle of oligarchs who have built their resource and energy empires on them. In March, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the program of the “Ukrainian Economic Passport”, which is intended to meet these voices. “All children born in Ukraine, until the age of 18, will be able to receive funds from the use and extraction of Ukraine's deposits, which will be deposited in their personal bank deposit account and, upon reaching the age of majority, they will be able to spend on obtaining higher education in Ukraine ” – Zelenski described the idea of ​​​​the project, arguing that “the times when there was a list of names who were considered the Ukrainian nation and could rule and use the deposits have ended”. According to the estimates presented by the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now the chairman of the National Reform Council in Ukraine, beneficiaries of the program could count on payments of PLN 15,000. dollars. Saakashvili also explained why the circle of people entitled to an ""economic passport"" was limited. ""There were several plans, for example, to give every citizen of Ukraine, but I was against it, because it would cost 400 hryvnias a year, and this is not money and looks like a mockery,"" he explained."
256	5	Freezer Act
256	7	The draft law on the economic passport of Ukrainians, providing for the participation of citizens in the income from the country's natural resources, was submitted to the Ukrainian parliament at the beginning of last year, but has not yet been voted on. According to the originators, the act is to regulate the issue of raising the standard of living of citizens in order to stop the outflow of Ukrainians abroad, and the way to achieve it is to create a Future Fund, in whose accounts 1 percent of the income would be deposited. from the amount of sales of all minerals extracted in the territory of our neighbor. These funds would go to all Ukrainians born after January 1, 2021, who lived in Ukraine for 18 years and would be paid after they reached the age of majority. According to the originators, the act is to regulate the issue of raising the standard of living of citizens in order to stop the outflow of Ukrainians abroad. According to the authors of the document, according to the data of the border service, 6.3 million citizens have left Ukraine permanently since 2001. In order to overcome this negative trend and direct the state policy towards raising the standard of living of Ukrainians in the country, as well as reducing the level of poverty, Ukraine must find ways to raise the standard of living of the population, and one of the variants is the deposition of revenues from minerals. The Future Fund is to be a legal entity established under public law by the government on behalf of the state.
256	9	Will the Ukrainian government encourage emigrants to return?
256	11	"The government would have the right to increase the percentage of funds from the exploitation of deposits, which would be transferred to the fund, as well as the right to additional subsidies to the fund from the state budget, which, however, given the state of our neighbor's public finances, will be rather unrealistic for a long time. In the analysis sent to the parliament, the Ministry of Finance pointed out that, in accordance with the tax code, all economic entities extracting minerals, including those from the oil and gas industry, are already tax payers, in particular income tax payers, they also pay the state a pension for the use of deposits, and they also pay local taxes and fees, and the budget also receives dividends from state-owned enterprises. ""The introduction of additional charges will increase the tax burden on the indicated entities, which in turn will lead to an increase in the price of minerals, including natural gas, to secure the needs of the population"" - assessed the ministry, which reacted negatively to the idea. The project was also critically assessed by the Ministry of Economic Development, which additionally pointed out the lack of a mechanism to protect the collected funds against inflation. Good intentions are not enough According to the economist Alexei Kushch, the project of the share of Ukrainians in the income from the use of raw materials should be approached in two stages - first an intellectual analysis is needed, then implementation. Kuszcz points out that Ukraine is today the only country in the world with an economy based on the export of raw materials that does not have a reserve fund, which makes the economy highly dependent on price fluctuations on global commodity markets. “The situation here is this: when prices in the markets go down, the whole economy goes down with them. And at the same time, we never have money for structural changes. 90 percent pension flows into the accounts of financial-industrial groups and purchases of yachts, villas and flats in London,” he commented. Ukraine is the only country with an economy based on the export of raw materials that does not have a reserve fund, and the economy is dependent on price fluctuations on world commodity markets. According to him, the very idea of ​​an ""economic passport"" is interesting, but the reserve fund should be filled not so much from the pension itself, but from export duties, including from agricultural goods and semi-finished products of the metallurgical industry exported from the Dnieper. On the one hand, this would give even tens of billions of dollars in the account in five years, and on the other hand, it would stimulate processing in the country instead of exporting raw materials. Another thing is the effective use of such money, because if - like the central bank's foreign exchange reserves - it will simply lie in the account, then the benefits from it will be small. Putting them in dollars is stimulating the US economy, not its own - warns the economist. “It will turn out that we finance the American economy with our raw material potential, while the economy's raw material potential is working to strengthen itself. Accordingly, the dependence on raw materials will only deepen. And it is necessary to invest funds in the Ukrainian economy: buy bonds of Ukrainian enterprises, issue loans to them, secure the connection of infrastructure. In a word, try to increase the level of processing to the maximum so that the dependence on raw materials overcomes itself. Otherwise, the current problems cannot be solved and the export of raw materials will become a self-propelling mechanism, he assessed. How much cake for each? Anatoly Amielin from the think-tank Ukrainian Institute of the Future calculated how much wealth falls on one Ukrainian. The components are: agricultural land, mineral deposits, forest, water, transport infrastructure, state-owned enterprises, municipal enterprises, intangible assets - patents and inventions of academies of science and research institutes, international assets of Ukraine, municipal infrastructure and currency and ore reserves of the central bank. Ukraine has 20,000 location of deposits of 117 types of minerals of economic importance. Of these, 8,172 deposits of 94 minerals are of economic importance. crude oil, natural gas, hard coal, uranium, iron, manganese, chromium and nickel, titanium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, gold, silver, mercury, beryllium, lithium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, niobium, cobalt , tin, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, yttrium and lanthanides as well as germanium and scandium. Today, 2,868 deposits are used. The valuation of these resources ranges from 3 to 8 trillion dollars. For his calculations, Amielin assumed the lowest value of these resources."
256	13	Ukraine - deposits for the bold
256	15	The resources of agricultural land that have remained in the hands of the state to date are estimated at 5 to 10 million hectares (the difference is due to the fact that the Ukrainian state has never carried out a comprehensive inventory of resources and the attractive resource was illegally taken over by large landowners). Assuming that the price of a hectare is 1 thousand. Ukraine's land resources are worth $5 billion. 10.4 million hectares of forests, counting at the minimum European price of 4 thousand. euros per hectare is another $47 billion. Value 167 thousand. km of Ukrainian roads, taking into account their degree of wear, Amielin estimates at USD 200 billion. Taking into account the comparison of the French energy concern Électricité de France, valued at USD 43 billion, the expert estimates that the Ukrainian nuclear energy concern Enerhoatom may be worth USD 14 billion, the same is worth the network of Ukrainian transit gas pipelines, and together with other state-owned enterprises it gives at least 30 billion dollars. The value of pure state assets in Ukraine per capita is PLN 78,000. USD, totaling USD 3.3 trillion. This could generate USD 150-300 billion in income from managing such assets, i.e. from 4,000 to 8,000. dollars per citizen per year. The value of these assets is approximately USD 3.3 trillion. The economist was unable to estimate the remaining components of Ukrainian wealth, so he ignores their value in his further considerations. Assuming that there are 41 million people living in Ukraine (38 million according to the government's estimate) and adjusting the value of assets for debt at the level of USD 82 billion. the value of net assets per capita is PLN 78 thousand. dollars. However, the problem is not in the amount of assets, but in how they are managed, and the task of the government is to increase this value, concludes Amielin. The state as a joint-stock company? Starting from the estimated value of assets belonging to all Ukrainians and assuming the average profit of investment funds of 5-10 percent. per year, the economist received a staggering amount of 150-300 billion dollars in income, which is from 4 to 8 thousand. dollars per citizen per year, which Ukrainians should obtain from their wealth, if the state was properly governed. Income obtained from the professional management of nationwide assets should be distributed among citizens in the manner of dividends paid out by companies in the form of various targeted programs. In his opinion, Ukrainians in this situation should first realize that there is no abstract state property and that the state simply manages their property. The next step should be: a reliable and complete inventory and valuation of this property. Then, an investment strategy should be developed taking into account the results of the audit, e.g. state-owned agricultural land should be leased on market terms, state-owned enterprises managed by professional managers, and infrastructure should be granted concessions. The income obtained from such professional management of nationwide assets should be distributed among citizens in the manner of dividends paid out by companies in the form of various targeted programs. However, as Amielin self-critically notes, our neighbors have not yet passed the first of these stages - realizing that the state is their property.
2562	1	Lithuania is “suffocating” Russia, which is why an escalation of the war is possible in the coming weeks. And where is Poland in all this?
2562	3	"At the time when this war in Ukraine had not yet begun, and in principle it should be written not so much war as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so when it had not yet begun, but basically everything was already clear, we wrote on our website that it will be better for Ukraine to give up these so-called ""rebel republics"" in the east of the country and keep peace and the rest of the country. As it is today, all ""independent thinkers"" see perfectly well."
2562	5	The situation at the front has reached such a point that Ukraine will not only lose the east of the country, but may cease to exist altogether, not to mention the thousands of civilian casualties, gigantic destruction and flood of various kinds of harm caused by the war. As Saint John Paul II used to say, in war there are no winners and losers, there are only dead people. These are very important words, and no one should choose war if there is another option.
2562	7	"Today, so-called experts and other ""geniuses"" say that Ukraine should give up the east of the country for peace. And I ask, where were these ""geniuses"" at the beginning, when everything could still be stopped? Initially, these so-called ""rogue republics"" had to be abandoned for the greater good, but the option of confrontation was chosen. So what if Ukraine will lose its territories today anyway, if it does not undo the war damages already done. One should be wise before the damage, not only after the damage."
2562	9	"So what if Russia is the aggressor? So what if Ukraine is a victim? So what if Putin is a murderer and a bandit? I ask, so what? I know it all, You know it all, but knowledge itself does not change anything. Only actions taken on the basis of knowledge can and do change reality, protect against wars, catastrophes and other cataclysms. However, we know it, but ""those up there"" and those so-called ""main gutter"" media at ""max"" were heating up the war, just to start it. This is my opinion, additionally I would like to add that ""tiemen from the USA"" are behind all this."
2562	11	"Putin is a calculating psychopath who seemed to be eager for a conflict, he was just waiting for a pretext, and the US and the ""US helpers"" gave this pretext to Russia. The drawing of Ukraine into NATO began, and here every thinking person knew perfectly well that Russia would never, ever allow it, and would be ""forced"" to invade militarily, and then a ""war conflagration"" would be set in motion, over which de facto no one prevails and whose development is impossible to predict."
2562	13	"Let me emphasize once again that it was enough to stop drawing Ukraine into NATO, and even to hand over to Russia those so-called ""rebellious republics"" in the east of Ukraine, and there would be peace to this day. However, that did not happen. The war has begun, which may turn into a global conflict, and this will also mean that Poland will suffer, it remains to fervently pray that our homeland will remain on the maps and be sovereign."
2562	15	People are dying, women, children, soldiers, men are dying, a great tragedy is happening, which we are not even able to fully comprehend with our minds. All of this could have been avoided in a very easy, terrifyingly easy way. But instead, today we continue to move to war, to escalate this conflict. Dear friends, Lithuania has started a blockade of the Kaliningrad District, so that the Russians cannot deliver supplies there by land.
2562	17	"Headlines like “Lithuania strangles Russia” appeared in the Polish media. In turn, the Russians speak directly about the provocation and the compulsion to create a ""humanitarian mission"" (i.e. a land invasion) to the Kaliningrad Oblast. Do you see what this leads to? Well, instead of trying to soften the war, to end it, Lithuania, Poland or the USA are striving to escalate the conflict so that it no longer takes place only in Ukraine but also spills over into neighboring countries, including Poland."
2562	19	"And what now? In the media they shout: ""war, war, war!"" Politicians of the ruling party shout: ""war, war, war!"" But, in my opinion, they will be the first from the country to ""give up"" when the war breaks out on Polish territory, because they have the money and contacts to do so. They are also traitors in my opinion. On the other hand, many and many ordinary Polish women and Poles will not flee the Republic, and instead they will see bombs exploding right next to their homes, or maybe directly in their homes."
2562	21	They will see the death of their loved ones, hunger will look into their eyes, they will see blood, weeping, gnashing of teeth, great people tragedies. This is partly what war looks like, so is it worth rushing to it as the politicians of the ruling party do? I'm asking, is it worth it? Unfortunately, at the moment it is already possible to strike Poland with missiles or land. In my opinion, if such an attack were to occur, it would occur in the fall or winter. That's why I'm urging you today to stock up on medicines and things you need (even power generators).
2563	3	Today in Madrid, the NATO summit begins. Allied countries are to increase their rapid reaction forces sevenfold. Everyone also expects China and Russia to be officially declared hostile countries, even if it is euphemistically put differently.
2563	5	NATO's strange war with Russia is going on, even if formally there is none. The Ukrainian-Russian war is de facto a proxy conflict between the USA and Russia, but willingly or not, numerous NATO member countries that supply Ukraine with weapons have become participants in military operations.
2563	9	Russia is openly demanding an end to such sustaining warfare, but NATO is seeking escalation instead of considering it. This is how Lithuania's attempts to block the Kaliningrad District can be interpreted. One can only suspect how it might end, and it doesn't look good.
2563	13	"Russia has already announced that it will retaliate for the ban on transit to Kaliningrad. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who took over Zhirinovsky's job as Kremlin threat-thrower after Zhirinovsky's death, says the threats will be very tough, ""capable of cutting off oxygen to Lithuania."""
2563	17	Medvedev also threatens that Sweden and Finland can easily join NATO, but Russia will also be ready to retaliate in this case. It is not known what it will be, but it can be suspected that it is about the propaganda placement of the Iskander launchers closer to their borders.
2563	21	The Polish government supports the aspirations of Sweden and Finland to join NATO. If the NATO countries agree to accession, consent will be given in the form of an act and ratification. The only brake is currently the Turkish president, Recep Erdoğan, who especially refuses to accept Sweden, which he considers a breeding ground for terrorism.
2563	25	"The highest-level Turkish delegation is attending the Madrid Summit, and surely Turkey, as a serious country, will not be sold cheaply. In turn, Russian propaganda describes the NATO meeting as a ""decision-making center supporting Ukrainian nationalists."""
2563	29	According to our propaganda, the current meeting of NATO states is to be a response to the challenges that the alliance has faced in recent months. It was announced that an increase in the number of its troops in Poland up to 300,000 would be discussed. Unfortunately, these declarations inevitably indicate that we are preparing for a war with Russia, and perhaps also with China.
2563	33	During the Madrid summit, China is to be announced as the main and most important rival, which will be included in NATO's new strategic document. This means that the North Atlantic Alliance will unfortunately become a tool in the hands of the US, which is fighting to maintain world hegemony.
2563	37	"China warns NATO, accusing it has already made enough mess in Europe. In turn, the Polish authorities expect that the new strategic concept of NATO will define Russia as the aggressor. According to the Polish authorities, you can see who and what Russia is. At the same time, it was stated that in diplomacy the word ""enemy"" must be used very carefully, which is why the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposes the word ""adversary""."
2565	1	Ukroshayba, or the mentality of slaves
2565	3	In any conflict, the sympathy of the observers is on the side of the weaker, and this is completely natural. In the case of the war in Ukraine, historical issues are also important for Poles and the desire to have a kind of buffer against a superpower, which, despite many weaknesses, is still Russia. However, following Kiev's point of view on every matter bears the hallmarks of an aberration, which can be described as ukroszajba.
2565	5	"In the period of ""People's Poland"", the slave mentality made us look at everything through the prism of Moscow's interests. In the economy, it took on a colonial image when, for example, coal was sold to the USSR for 10% of the market price and at a time when Western recipients were ready to pay normally. Everyone knows how this lunar economy ended. In 2022, the slave mentality among the rulers and recipients of the regime's propaganda made itself felt again. Even Russian dumplings were not spared. On the issue of Volhynia, anyone who brings up this frenzy of atrocities is immediately hailed as a ""Ruthenian cunt"", and there are even humanoid beings who try to justify the Volhynia massacre with the alleged ""Polish occupation"" and ""persecution"". Did the Poles, after the years of partitions, move with axes and pitchforks on the Germans, Austrians or Russians? When, for years, cool Poles remained indifferent to the poverty and suffering of their compatriots, after February 24, 2022, they got the proverbial ""fuck"" about Ukrainians. Let us emphasize it clearly: there is nothing wrong with helping war victims, but there is one fundamental limit – the good of Poles. When we read that the managers of the Third Republic of Poland took a loan of EUR 450 million to help refugees from Ukraine, and earlier Turkey simply received EUR 6 billion from the EU to support immigrants from Syria and other countries, we ask where is the limit of servility and distribution for which Polish taxpayers will pay? The war is taking place in a small part of Ukraine's territory, but the Warsaw government has decided to accept everyone and pay social benefits that until now have been reserved for Polish citizens. At the end of June 2022, military aid for Ukraine from Warsaw was to exceed EUR 1.8 billion. 230 tanks were handed over without the guarantee of ""compensation"" for weakening their own defense potential, as other countries, such as Slovakia or the Czech Republic, did."
2566	3	"The German ""Ostpolitik"" life after life. Was there really a breakthrough in Berlin's politics on February 24?"
2566	5	"Times, political systems, chancellors, even the territorial shape of the statehood of our western neighbor are changing - only Germany's ""Ostpolitik"" seems to be unchanged, regardless of whether the capital is in Bonn or Berlin. On the other hand, Russia is changing - but is it tsarist ""white Russia"" or Soviet ""red Russia"" (to use the terms formulated by Jan Kucharzewski) or Putin's post-communist Russian Federation, it occupies a special place in Berlin's politics."
2566	7	Germany in the service of Russia
2566	9	"Where does it come from? Primarily for two reasons. The first is history. The second is the belief that by definition large states should negotiate above the heads of smaller states, they should dictate order, and others will have to find their way in it. One of the most outstanding, though at the same time the most controversial, rulers of Russia, Tsarina Catherine II was born as a German, otherwise in Szczecin, as Zofia Fryderyka Augusta von Anhalt-Zerbst. Tsarina Catherine is an example of one of the very century of collective service of Germans for the Russian state. Native Germans and their children became generals and governors in the 18th and 19th centuries. They served the Russian state, but did not forget about their roots. Besides, the enemy of Russia was Napoleon and the Poles, not the Prussians. Did the combination of indigenous Germanness and Russian statehood turn into programmatic anti-Polonism? This is what Tsarina Catherine was supposed to say about Poles to her foreign minister Nikita Panin: “You have to dismantle this nation from the inside, kill its morality. (...), If it is not possible to make him a corpse, at least make him fester and putrefy in his bed... We must inoculate him with a disease, cause hereditary leprosy, eternal anarchy and discord... We must teach a brother to inform on a brother, and a son to jump down my father's throat. They need to be broken up so that they divide and fight, always looking for an arbiter somewhere."" The authorship of these words is attributed to a German who ruled Russia and led to three partitions of Poland, although she not only had an affair with a Polish diplomat, later King Stanisław August, but also had a child with him, daughter Anna Piotrowna, officially recognized by Catherine's husband the Tsar Peter III (this case was an open secret, and the tsar himself was so furious that he wanted the case resolved by the so-called Secret Chancellery)."
2566	11	"In the excellent British feature film ""The Last Tsars"" about the end of the Romanov dynasty, a real scene is shown when the wife of the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas Romanov - Alexandra Romanowa, i.e. Victoria Alicja Helena Louise Beatrice of Hesse-Darmstadt, also born as a German, begs her husband in 1914, not to go to war with Germany. She believed that it would be not only her personal misfortune, but also a tragedy for both countries. The famous Rasputin, who wanted to dissuade the tsar from this intention, thought the same. This is just a reminder that the German-born Russian rulers remained somewhat loyal to their first homeland."
2566	12	New times - the old order, or Berlin inscribed in Moscow's policy (and vice versa)
2566	14	"During the times of the German Federal Republic, later transformed into the Federal Republic of Germany, and the coexistence of two German states belonging to two different political blocs, the axis of Bonn's policy was to arrange relations with the Soviet Union in such a way as to guarantee to Moscow that western Germany, despite having American military bases as a result of the American occupation of the country German after World War II - they will not, however, directly be a card in Washington's geopolitical deck. Contrary to the stereotype, not only the social democrats, although they flaunted it especially, like Willi Brandt and Helmut Schmidt (I met him years later in Hamburg at a conference where I was a minister of the Polish government), but also the Christian Democrats from the CDU and the CSU pursued special relationship with Moscow. They were far from ""Cold War"" and close to ""appeasement"" in the style of Her Majesty's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy towards Germany in the late 1930s. The Volga Germans, the German minority in the USSR, the Germans in Kazakhstan had their own schools, and their children could learn their mother tongue - unlike Poles. In this way, Bonn also obtained liberalization in relations with the second, communist German state - East Germany, which guaranteed, at least partially, the so-called family reunification, i.e. consent to a very limited or selective, but nevertheless, emigration to West Germany, but no longer guaranteed the avoidance of spying by ""red Berlin"" - ""capitalist Bonn""."
2566	16	"The long-term political goal of the GFR/FRG elite was, of course, the unification of the two German states. However, this was achieved not thanks to the soft ""Ostpolitik"" but to the ""Cold War"" imposition of the arms race on Soviet Russia by the USA."
2566	18	"After the fall of communism, the post-Soviet Russian Federation, with a population of 150 million people and a colossal market, was a great opportunity for the German economy. Berlin took advantage of this opportunity by securing special relations with the Kremlin. First, he was the beneficiary of the ""freedom"", the weakness of the Russian state under Boris Yeltsin, and then the fact that you could talk to Putin in German. Germany's policy was largely in line with Russia's policy. Over the past thirty years, Moscow has not really wanted to negotiate with the European Union that replaced the EEC: it preferred bilateral talks with the largest Western European countries, primarily with Germany and France. The ""great"" and ""big"" assumed, for years effectively, that such a European ""balance of power"" must be created to guarantee the interests of Moscow, Berlin and Paris, above all."
2566	19	They were, are and will be together?
2566	21	It is characteristic that the policy of close relations between Moscow and Berlin was continued even after February 2014, when Russia took Crimea from Ukraine, and in fact also Donetsk and Lugansk. Inconsistent, non-deep sanctions were introduced, and the issue of excluding Russia from the SWIFT system was not addressed at all. Every six months, the European Council, led by Germany, unanimously extended the sanctions against the Russian Federation, but it was a kind of theater, because behind the scenes Belin built Nord Stream with Moscow and neutralized Ukraine together with France in the unfortunate Normandy Format, which in fact served Russia to prepare to war.
2566	23	"It is characteristic that at that time Germany, together with France, but also with Italy, blocked the Polish-American initiative in 2008 to present a ""road map"" for Georgia's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty at the summit in Bucharest. Germany skilfully played the ""human rights"" card to pillory post-Soviet states that wanted to break free from Russia's tutelage or at least reduce their dependence on it, such as Ukraine or Azerbaijan, and then Kazakhstan. In this way, Berlin de facto guaranteed Moscow the status quo and the maintenance of its influence. Even now (sic!) this policy is continued in the context of Georgia and preventing it from being granted the status of an EU candidate country."
2567	3	British general Patrick Sanders argues that we are now in the same place where Europe was just before the start of World War II. “In all my years in uniform, I have never experienced such a clear threat to the principles of sovereignty and democracy and the freedom to live without fear of violence,” he said.
2567	5	A top British general has compared Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the aggression of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler before World War II. He stressed that all forces should be mobilized to prevent the ongoing war from spreading to Europe.
2567	7	"Now, as then, our choices will have a disproportionate impact on the future,” said Chief of the General Staff General Patrick Sanders during a speech at a conference in London.
2567 9 This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war, but we must act quickly lest we be drawn into it by failing to contain territorial expansion,” he added."
2567	11	Sanders expressed his belief that the world is going through a period of history as significant as the one leading up to World War II, before the Nazi war machine unleashed all-out war and occupied most of Europe. The general stated that the British Army is not mobilizing to make war, it is mobilizing to prevent it.
2567	13	"For us, the vision of a European land war is not just a distant vision of thunderclouds rolling on the horizon, we are seeing it now,” he said.
2567 15 In all my years in uniform, I have not experienced such a clear threat to the principles of sovereignty and democracy and the freedom to live without fear of violence as Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the expansionist ambitions of Russian President Vladimir Putin,” added Sanders."
2567	17	His remarks come as some world leaders head to Madrid for the upcoming NATO summit. The military alliance announced on Tuesday that it would increase the size of its rapid response unit from 40,000 to 40,000. up to 300 thousand soldiers.
2567	19	Meanwhile, Russia is gradually gaining ground in Donbass in the eastern part of Ukraine, where the war has become the scene of shifting fronts, artillery exchanges and counter-offensives.
2568	1	Behind the scenes of Macron's talks with Putin. We learned the reason for the invasion of Ukraine
2568	3	President, Europe and War is a French documentary that shows the backstage of Emmanuel Macron's talks with Vladimir Putin, Olaf Scholz, Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky from February 20 until the arrival of Western leaders in Kiev. The president of Russia in the recordings says, among others: about the motive for attacking Ukraine.
2568	5	The main themes of the film directed by Guy Lagache, broadcast on France 2 television, are fears of an escalation of the war in Ukraine, the risk of a nuclear conflict, Putin's increasingly radical actions and the strategy of diplomacy led by the Elysée Palace.
2568	6	This is why Putin attacked Ukraine
2568	8	Lagache was authorized to record the entire conversation between the French president and the Russian president on February 20, fragments of which have been published in the media for several days.
2568	10	"This is not a democratically elected government. They came to power as a result of a coup d'état, people were burned alive, there was bloodshed, and Zelensky is one of those responsible,"" Putin said at the time.
2568 12 The Russian politician also stated that the basis of dialogue is taking into account the interests of the other side, and the pro-Russian separatists in Donbas made such proposals to the Ukrainians, but did not receive any response to them.
2568 14 Macron notes, however, that Russia is a party to the Minsk agreements and they do not provide that the proposals presented by the separatists should be the basis for dialogue.
2568 16 When your negotiator tries to force the Ukrainians to talk on the basis of the separatists' plans, it does not respect the Minsk agreements. It will not be the separatists who will come up with proposals on Ukrainian rights!"" - says Macron."
2568	18	"He adds that he has in front of him the text of the agreements and it says: the proposals are presented by the government of Ukraine in consultation and with the consent of representatives of some regions of the Donbass within the framework of the tripartite contact group. ""That's exactly what we're proposing. So I have no idea where your lawyer studied law,"" says Macron. He also said he didn't know which lawyer could certify that in a sovereign state the texts of laws are presented by separatist groups, not democratically elected authorities ."
2568	19	Putin: I'm at the gym and I'd like to go play hockey now
2568	21	"The French president said he had spoken with Zelensky and asked him to calm down the situation on social media and in the Ukrainian armed forces. However, he called on Putin to calm down the Russian armed forces as well. ""There were a lot of bombings yesterday. If we want to give dialogue a chance, we need to calm down the situation in the region,"" he added."
2568	23	Macron recalls the conversation with Joe Biden, who - as the French president assured - is ready to meet with Putin, so the French president proposes a talk between the two leaders in Geneva in the coming days. Putin replies that it is a proposal worth considering and should be discussed with the advisers of both presidents. The conversation ends with Putin remarking that he is working out at the gym and would like to go play hockey.
2568	25	Macron's advisers, including the chief diplomatic adviser Emmanuel Bonne, openly say in the video that Putin uses lies.
2568	26	Behind the scenes politics
2568	28	The documentary begins with a report on Macron's arrival in Kiev and a meeting with Zelensky on February 8, during which the backstage of trade negotiations between France and Ukraine regarding the conclusion of investment contracts by French companies is revealed. The document also devoted a lot of space to Macron's speech on the future of Europe and its vision, which he gave at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
2568	30	"Lagache also witnesses Macron's conversations with his advisers, his preparations for television appearances, and his defense council crisis meetings in the bunker beneath the Elysée Palace in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Scenes from the speeches of Western European politicians are accompanied by footage from attacks on, among others, on Kyiv, Mariupol and drastic photos from Bucza. In Macron's entourage, Russia's attacks on Ukraine's nuclear power plants and the ""threat of a second Chernobyl"" as well as the risk of a nuclear conflict aroused great concern."
2568	32	The film practically does not mention Poland, the Baltic states, Romania or Moldova, or information about the wave of war refugees crossing the borders of these countries. All speeches of Polish and Eastern European leaders, both at the meeting in Versailles and during the summit of 27 EU countries on the war in Ukraine, were also omitted.
257	3	On Wednesday, representatives of the US and Germany confirmed earlier press reports that the two countries had reached an agreement to end the dispute over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. This means that Ukrainians have more than enough reason to fear for their own future.
257	5	Budapest Memorandum
257	7	"Today no one remembers (or rather does not want to remember) that for a moment Ukraine was a nuclear power, thanks to which other powers gave it a guarantee of full security. It happened right after the collapse of the USSR. At that time, the independent Ukrainian state ascertained that it had 176 strategic and over 2.5 thousand assets in its hands. tactical missiles with nuclear warheads. Only the United States and Russia had more at that time. Both of these countries, together with West Germany, France and Great Britain, immediately began to put pressure on Kyiv to transfer the entire arsenal to Russia. This was done discreetly, because there was no reason for independent Ukraine to give back what it legally inherited from the USSR. The pressure from the superpowers bore fruit and in December 1994, during the Budapest summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), President Leonid Kravchuk announced Ukraine's renunciation of its ambitions to remain a nuclear power. The entire West applauded him for handing over the missiles and nuclear warheads to Russia. Washington then promised economic support, and Moscow promised cheap fuel and electricity. To the so-called The Budapest Memorandum included security guarantees in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons. The Kremlin and the Western powers promised in writing, among other things, protection of Ukraine's independence and the ""inviolability of existing borders""."
257	9	Crimea and the War in Donbass
257	11	Twenty years have passed and the Ukrainians dreamed of leaving Russia's sphere of influence, because they wanted, like Poland and other Central European countries, to join the wealthy West. The overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych and the new government's desire to join NATO and the European Union put Vladimir Putin's imperial plans in jeopardy. Unable to subjugate all of Ukraine with one stroke, the Russian president annexed Crimea and started a war in the Donbass. The West responded with moderately onerous sanctions. Two decades after the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, Russia grabbed a large part of Ukraine's territory and cut off cheap fuel supplies, while the other signatories of the document did not fulfill the guarantees given to Kiev. In this way, the Ukrainians found out the hard way that there is a difference between whether you have a piece of paper signed by representatives of the superpowers or your own nuclear warheads. The economically weak, practically disarmed country (during Yanukovych's presidency spending on the army was reduced to symbolic amounts) has one trump card. It was a network of gas pipelines that transported gas from Russia to Western Europe (Germany was and is its main recipient). A full-scale war in 2014 threatened to damage the transmission grid or, in desperation, the Ukrainians themselves would block it. At that time, around 55 billion m3 of gas was pumped annually through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea. The maximum transmission capacity of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline running through Belarus and Poland is 33 billion m3. Approximately 65 billion m3 of gas flowed to the West via gas pipelines through Ukraine. It is easy to see that the Russian army's march on Kyiv could have cost Moscow a sudden loss of up to 50 percent of its GDP. revenues from the export of blue fuel plus even tougher sanctions from the West. And worst of all, Western recipients, led by Germany, would be encouraged to look for other suppliers. The rapid expansion of gas terminals would open the EU to liquefied gas supplies from the US and the Middle East. New pipelines from Norwegian and British deposits would also be an option. The risk was no longer calculated. Thus, the Kremlin even gave up the fight to carve out another area from Ukraine, connecting Crimea directly with Russia. Although it is a necessity, because currently the peninsula has been cut off from key water sources, and the only thing that connects it with the rest of the Russian state is the Crimean Bridge over the Kerch Strait.
257	13	Energiewende - Merkel's beloved child
257	15	"The network of gas pipelines running through Ukraine largely saved the country, defenseless in 2014, from Vladimir Putin going a few steps further. At the same time, she motivated Angela Merkel to take very decisive actions. The sudden reduction in Russian gas supplies put her beloved child, the Energiewende, in jeopardy. Throughout her rule, the German Chancellor consistently implemented the great energy transformation of the country. Germany promotes renewable energy sources while phased out power plants, first hard coal-fired, then nuclear, and finally lignite-fired. However, the power loss in the network must be successively supplemented by new gas-fired power plants. And fuel from Russia is the cheapest and easiest to deliver for Germany. In addition, the ""export"" of Energiewende to other EU countries is underway. This means that together with him Germany will redistribute and resell the gas purchased from Russia to others. In this puzzle, it will become a key country in the future, both for the western and eastern parts of the Old Continent. The Kremlin will not be able to cut off the supply of blue fuel due to the risk of huge financial losses. Others give up gas, because then they will risk the stability of their own energy systems. Until recently, obstacles piled up on the road to mutually beneficial energy cooperation between Berlin and Moscow, of which the opposition of Poland and Ukraine was among the smallest. The full security of the Energiewende required the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Without it, Berlin had to take great care of Ukraine's stability and support its government, entering into conflict with Russia, whether it wanted it or not. Donald Trump skilfully used this, blocking the very completion of the construction of NS2, in order to force Germany to submit to many economic issues. The problem of Berlin was solved by voters in the US, because the new administration changed Washington's strategy. It is rational by all means. Since China is such a powerful and, what is worse, still growing enemy, the front should be kept as short as possible. This means ceasing to disperse forces around the world, extinguishing conflicts with potential allies, and throwing most of the possessed potential into the region of East Asia in the main direction of action. Nord Stream 2 and the benefits of the three powers In this puzzle, completing NS2 gives benefits to the three powers at once. President Biden, lifting the blockade from the construction of NS2, gains a renewal of cordial friendship with West Germany. Chancellor Merkel may begin to extinguish the real fields of conflict with Russia and stop worrying about the continuity of gas supplies. President Putin is finally given more room for maneuver over Ukraine. On the other hand, Kyiv, in the agreement concluded by Washington and Berlin, was assured that: ""if Russia tries to use energy as a weapon or commits further acts of aggression against Ukraine, Germany will take action at the national level and will press for effective measures at the European level, including sanctions to limit Russian import opportunities in the energy sector. Well, 25 years ago, the Budapest Memorandum spoke of securing independence and the inviolability of borders. Thus, a certain minimization of the scope of the security guarantee can be seen. What is worse, the resultant of the interests of the three big players makes it reasonable to assume that in some time the current scope of guarantees for Ukraine will be further reduced by them. The timeless principle is that if someone wants to gain, someone else must pay for it. In this case, one country is ideally suited to the role of the main payer."
2570	1	Tusk declares: We will guarantee the legality of abortion up to 12 weeks
2570	3	PO leader Donald Tusk declared on Tuesday in Wałbrzych that if PO wins the elections, he will guarantee legal access to abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy (after consulting a patient with a doctor). He also promised the introduction of civil partnerships and a review of transgender law.
2570	5	The leader of the Civic Platform, who has been in Lower Silesia for two days, met on Tuesday with the inhabitants of Wałbrzych and the surrounding area. One of the discussion participants asked about proposals for legal solutions for non-heteronormative persons.
2570	7	"The head of the PO said that if Law and Justice loses the upcoming parliamentary elections, it will mean that ""xenophobia, contempt for differences, lack of respect for people of a different sexual orientation or transgender have lost"". He admitted that in the Civic Platform there are people with ""different types of sensitivity"" regarding the rights of non-heteronormative people. ""I try - and sometimes I get a headache for it - to pursue a policy of effective, although too slow from the point of view of the circles you mentioned, march towards modernity and tolerance, which must also take root in our heads and hearts , not only in laws,"" added Tusk."
2570	9	"He announced that if he wins the election, he will decide to legalize civil unions. ""I know that this is the first step and I know that it is still not always popular in various, not only political, environments, but we must show that in matters of human dignity, including the dignity of people with a different sexual orientation than the more dominant one, there can no longer be a purely political calculation that, for example, it is not worth taking a decision because it will not have the support of the majority,"" stressed Tusk."
2570	11	"When it comes to the issue of adoption of children by same-sex people, he added that the debate on this issue is ""only ahead of us"". ""It's not just about possible administrative or legislative decisions. I would really like people to start accepting and understanding issues that have so far been incomprehensible to them. If you ask me, is the right to adopt children (... ""I don't know that today, really. I don't want to give my word, knowing that I will need a majority in parliament for these slightly more ambitious decisions of a moral nature,"" Tusk noted."
2570	14	Tusk announced legal abortion
2570	16	"The PO leader also announced a relaxation of the right to abortion. ""We have this project for legal abortion up to 12 weeks, which is to be a woman's decision in consultation with a doctor, and not a decision of a priest, prosecutor and PiS activist. We will guarantee it one hundred percent,"" said the head of PO."
2570	18	"Referring to the situation of transgender people, Tusk assessed that the legal procedure in this matter is humiliating, because it makes such people sue their parents. ""These regulations on transgenderism need to be looked at in great detail so that there are no obstacles that are so devastating for the psyche, especially when it comes to a young person or a child,"" added the head of PO."
2570	20	"He pointed out that in Poland we are dealing with a record number of suicides among children. ""One of the reasons is this stuffiness, this feeling that the authorities, referring to tradition or religion, suppress those people who simply want to live with dignity. They do not want to impose anything on anyone, but they want to live as they can, as they want it simply belongs, because everyone has the right to their own way of life, to their own dignity, and those who have a different view must come to terms with the fact that their view of life and values ​​is their view and does not have to be binding for everyone others,"" stressed Tusk."
2570	22	"In February last year, the National Board of PO adopted a new position on reproductive rights, which it titled ""Women's Rights Package"". It included, among others, a proposal to legalize abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy after the patient's consultation with a doctor and psychologist, reimbursement of contraceptives (also ""the day after""), prenatal tests and in vitro procedures."
2572	1	"Korwin-Mikke with understanding about abortion. ""If a woman carries a monster inside her..."""
2572	3	"Let's start with the fact that a woman cannot be blackmailed by a man into having an abortion. It is unacceptable for a partner to say to his girlfriend, ""Look, you need to have an abortion."" If abortion were legal, the number of abortions would certainly be lower, says Janusz Korwin-Mikke, MP of the Confederation, to DoRzeczy.pl."
2572	5	"Yesterday, a women's protest against the ban on abortion took place in front of the Sejm. The ladies wanted to express their opposition to the civic project ""Stop Abortion"" by Kai Godek. Should a woman have the right to have an abortion or not?"
2572	7	No. I am on the side of Mrs. Godek, but the project with which she came to the Sejm is too rigorous. It leaves no choice to women, and a woman must have a choice. The problem with abortion is something else.
2572	9	What?
2572	11	Determining who we consider human. If a woman carries a monster inside her, it cannot be protected by the protection of the human species. Everything, of course, depends on the assessment of the doctor.
2572	13	"So you can understand women who say they don't want to give birth to a ""sick fetus""?"
2572	15	Yes. I can understand a normal woman who may happen to have something in her womb instead of a human being that will never function normally. However, the ladies you mentioned at the beginning don't convince me at all.
2572	17	Why?
2572	19	Because they behaved in an incomprehensible way when appearing in the Sejm and defending pedophilia.
2573	1	"Biedroń strongly attacked Hołownia. ""A disgusting and cowardly idea"""
2573	3	"Szymon Hołownia proposed holding a referendum on the access of Polish women to abortion. Robert Biedroń did not like the initiative of the leader of Poland 2050. He called the idea ""disgusting and cowardly."""
2573	5	Robert Biedroń commented on the idea of ​​organizing a referendum on abortion proposed by Szymon Hołownia. The politician compared this initiative with a TV show.
2573	7	The disgusting and cowardly idea of ​​a referendum on abortion. Someone confused a TV show where viewers decide who wins with the real lives of millions of women. A politician must have the courage to change – Biedroń wrote on Twitter.
2573	9	The leader of Poland 2050 did not remain indifferent to Biedroń's entry. Hołownia commented on the tweet as follows:
2573	11	"How much do you have to despise people and love yourself so that giving people a voice is called ""disgusting cowardice"", and giving voice to yourself - ""courage""."
2573	13	Hołownia wants a referendum
2573	15	According to the leader of Poland 2050, a referendum should be held on the abortion law in Poland. – I want to see and hear in Poland not the will of Jarosław Kaczyński about what women should do with their lives, but I want to see and hear the will of Poles – he said on Polsat News on Friday.
2573	17	According to Hołownia, this would allow decisions to be made without the mediation of political parties. At the same time, the leader of Poland 2050 pointed out that the most difficult task in preparing this initiative would be to write questions.
2573	19	Reaction to Biedron's entry
2573	21	Biedroń's comment caused a stir on the web. Konrad Piasecki disagreed with Biedroń's opinion. The journalist wrote:
2573	23	"What is disgusting about giving the vote to the citizens? Why is the electoral vote not a ""show"" and the referendum vote already is? If the liberal abortion law is to be permanent, the voice of the general public will be its best guarantor."
2573	25	Jan Śpiewak spoke in a similar tone.
2573	27	MPs voting in the Sejm on abortion are great, but people in direct elections are wrong? I think a rank-and-file MP is more demoralized and stupider than a rank-and-file citizen of our country. Why does the New Left dislike democracy so much and is protective of people? the activist wrote.
2573	29	The idea of ​​a referendum also has many opponents. He was assessed negatively by Wojciech Karpieszczuk, journalist of Gazeta Wyborcza.
2573	31	Some issues are not put to a referendum. Would you ask in a referendum whether Jews can run in elections and hold public office? No? Exactly. Then why do you want to ask whether women should die because of the ban on abortion? - he wrote.
2574	1	Kwaśniewski on abortion: If I were in power, I would slightly liberalize this law
2574	3	Aleksander Kwaśniewski, former president, was a guest on Radio ZET. During the long conversation, the topic of abortion was also raised. Kwaśniewski admitted that if he were still in power, he would “liberalize the anti-abortion law a bit”.
2574	5	"Kwaśniewski admitted that in the current conditions he is a supporter of the abortion compromise that is currently in force. According to the former president, ""this is the maximum that can be done in this matter."" The politician also added that as of today there is no possibility of liberalizing this act. This is influenced by the composition of the parliament, which is much more conservative than in previous years. (…) The last time such an opportunity to liberalize an act was in the previous times, when both the left and the Palikot group entered parliament, and if then the PO, in its liberal part, was brave enough to liberalize this act, it would probably be the last one possibility. At the moment, we have a very conservative parliament, which, if given a free hand, would probably make this law much stricter, make it more restrictive - he said and repeated that the mentioned compromise ""is the maximum that we can have today""."
2574	7	"Aleksander Kwaśniewski, during the presidential campaign, during which he fought for the head of state with Lech Wałęsa, admitted that he was in favor of abortion in some cases. Abortion should be legal - in the case of health complications related to childbirth, permanent damage to the fetus and for social reasons - he said. After a wave of criticism from the Catholic Church fell on him, he added: When it comes to attitudes towards abortion or church-state relations, I believe that most of society thinks closer to me than to bishops. On the part of the hierarchs of the Church, I do not see any inclination to dialogue or recognition that one can look at the same matters differently. The compromise proposed by the Church looks like this: ""It should be as we want, and anyone who thinks otherwise should be on the margins of political life."" There can be no consent to this."
2574	9	In 2004, after winning the first round of the second presidential election in which he participated, he declared that he was in favor of the compromise worked out in the 1990s. My position remains unchanged. What has been achieved as a result of a dramatic discussion in Poland and a compromise with the Church should be maintained - he said and added that if he becomes president for the second time, he will veto the project allowing abortion for social reasons.
2575	1	What does the Commission intend to do about abortion in Poland? Debate in the European Parliament on the anniversary of Przyłębska's judgment
2575	3	"In this room, we must have the courage to say: abortion is simply a medical benefit. Abortion is a human right. Abortion is ok,"" said Sylwia Spurek in the EP. Beata Mazurek quoted John Paul II, and Jadwiga Wiśniewska accused the Parliament of hypocrisy"
2575	5	"On October 20, 2021, the European Parliament held a debate initiated on the occasion of the anniversary of the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of October 22, 2020, which actually prohibits abortion in Poland. Anže Logar, on behalf of the European Council, was the first to speak, emphasizing that ""abortion is a legally and ethically sensitive issue, and the European Court of Human Rights leaves a very wide margin for Member States to determine whether it will be legally allowed and in what cases""."
2575	7	"The Commissioner for Equal Treatment, Helena Dalli, who spoke after him, also pointed out that the EU has no competence in cases concerning abortion. “Abortion in Poland is available only to women who have money to go abroad. The pandemic has made it even more difficult,” Dalli noted. She stressed that ""sexual and reproductive health rights should be the same for men and women"" and that they include not only abortion, but also contraception, treatment for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. But she pointed out that health regulations, including abortion, are outside the competence of the EU, so the EU can only ""encourage women's rights in medical services""."
2575	9	Łukacijewska: Polish women need support
2575	11	On behalf of the EPP Group, MEP Elżbieta Łukacijewska (PO) spoke, referring directly to the statements of representatives of the Council and the Commission:
2575	13	“We know that this is the competence of the member states. Nevertheless, a signal is needed from this chamber, a discussion addressed to Polish women, that we know about these problems, know them and support them.
2575	15	Łukacijewska quoted statistics on the percentage of abortions performed before the verdict due to fetal defects.
2575	17	“No ban will limit the number of procedures and will not make women want to be mothers. The Polish government is trying to force women into heroism. No politician can be the conscience of Polish women,” she said.
2575	19	“It is sad that it is not the Polish government, but the governments of other countries - the Czech Republic, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, that are extending a helping hand to Poland. Poland is becoming an unfriendly country for mothers, and pregnancy is burdened with risk and fear.
2575	21	The politician emphasized that the issue of abortion is not the only sin of the Polish government regarding reproductive rights. She recalled the closure of in vitro, problems with access to prenatal tests, poor support for families bringing up disabled people, lack of real access to sex education.
2575	23	"""We are responsible for the events in Poland"""
2575	25	Predrag Matić also strongly referred to the conservative position of the European establishment. Speaking on behalf of the S&D, he referred to a meeting with activists of the National Women's Strike that had previously taken place in the Parliament:
2575	27	“I was shocked because not only is access to healthcare limited, but those who have taken to the streets to protest are intimidated. I want to say that I admire the courage of all those people who stand up for their rights.
2575	29	We are partly responsible for this matter, because the Commission is hiding behind the argument of national competence. This is convenient for people who don't care about European values ​​and spit on them.
2575	31	That is why I want to ask the European Commission: what should we do? Today it is Poland, and tomorrow maybe some other country.
2575	33	“Yesterday we talked about the rule of law in Poland. Today's discussion is about that. After all, we are talking about a decision of a politicized Constitutional Court,” said Karen Melchior, a Danish MEP from Let's Renew Europe.
2575	35	"“Our democracy is also at risk if minorities are attacked. When coal was dug up, canaries were taken with them to warn of an impending explosion. Today, human rights activists are harassed and intimidated by their own government, which wants to silence them. We have to show them that they are not alone, the whole world is watching them."""
2575	37	Spanish MEP María Eugenia Rodríguez Palop and Slovak MEP Michal Šimečka also emphasized that the issue of Poland is a universal problem, as movements aimed at questioning women's reproductive rights can also be observed in their countries.
2575	39	Spurek: It's time for the Commission to take the women's side
2575	41	"Sylwia Spurek (Greens) announced that on the anniversary of the sentence, Polish women will take to the streets again under the slogan ""We defend life. women's lives."""
2575	43	“In this room, we must have the courage to say: abortion is simply a medical benefit. Abortion is a human right. Abortion is ok. Without the right to abortion, there is no equality policy in the EU, no cohesion policy. A year has passed since the decision of the Constitutional Tribunal. Has the Commission looked for solutions? Was it more convenient to drop the subject and hide behind the lack of competence?” the MEP said.
2575	45	“Commissioner, if competences are a barrier for you, it's time for legislative changes. It is time for the Commission to unconditionally take the side of women, to support brave Polish women who have been consistently protesting in the streets for years. Despite the hate, at the expense of professional and private life.
2575	47	Wiśniewska on the post-abortion syndrome
2575	49	"“Abortion is not, has not been and will never be ok. We must be aware that those who have abortions experience great suffering afterwards. Sometimes they are unable to recover from this trauma for the rest of their lives. Commissioner Dalli expressed concern about the availability of abortion in Poland. And what's it like in Malta? Isn't there the most restrictive law on this issue in the European Union? Is that why this issue of Malta is not raised in the EP because there is a left-wing government in Malta?” said Jadwiga Wiśniewska (ECR, PiS). ""It shows how full of hypocrisy you are. With this debate, you bear witness to the degradation of the essence of the rule of law in the EU."""
2575	51	The PiS MEP stated that abortion is not a human right, and in support of her theses, she cited the Convention on the Rights of the Child: “a child, due to its physical and mental immaturity, requires special care and attention, including proper legal protection, both against, as well as after birth.
2575	53	Biedroń: Polish Taliban go further
2575	55	"""Women's hell continues. A year ago, Kaczyński sealed the sentence against women. Poland has become a de facto patriarchal religious state in which Polish women, like the protagonists of The Handmaid's Tale, are deprived of their voice and reduced to the role of an incubator. This is terrifying barbarism and torture established by the government,” said Robert Biedroń."
2575	57	“Unfortunately, the Polish Taliban do not stop there. Another bill has been submitted to the Sejm, which will treat abortion, which is a threat to a woman's life and health, as murder, which is to be punishable by life imprisonment. It was PiS who led to the fact that in 2021 Polish women have fewer rights than when Poland joined the EU.
2575	59	The rule of law according to John Paul II
2575	61	Beata Mazurek began with a quote from John Paul II: 'The unborn child is also a human being. Moreover, Christ identifies himself with the smallest. How then can one not see it in the unborn being? (…) When the state does not use its power to defend the weak, the foundations of the rule of law of the state are at stake.”
2575	63	“Poland will defend the rule of law. We will not let a left-wing dictate be imposed on us. We will defend the rights of unborn children and repeat ad nauseam that the competence in the organization of health care systems lies within the competence of the Member States, said the PiS MEP.
2575	65	Róża Thun also spoke, referring directly to the words of Jadwiga Wiśniewska accusing the EP of hypocrisy:
2575	67	“Hypocrisy is pretending to defend human life from conception to natural death. Instead of giving a hand to women in a desperate situation, taking care of them, supporting them, they are ruthlessly pushed into the illegal underground, dangerous to their health, or sent abroad.
2575	69	"The MEP also referred to the situation on the border with Belarus: “Behind our border, behind the barbed wire, adults and children are dying of hunger, thirst and cold. Let me point out that they too are conceived children. But they're already big."""
2576	1	Jambor caused a storm. Confederation MP changes his mind on abortion?
2576	3	Artur Dziambor has long presented himself as an opponent of abortion. However, his recent statements suggest that the politician allows abortion in certain situations. Even Robert Winnicki argues with his party colleague.
2576	5	Last Thursday, the Constitutional Court ruled that eugenic abortion is unconstitutional. The decision was made by a majority of votes. Judges Leon Kieres and Piotr Pszczółkowski submitted a dissenting opinion to the judgment. MPs of the Confederation have long demanded a tightening of the abortion law and the removal of, among others, so-called eugenic abortion.
2576	7	The Constitutional Tribunal did what PiS did not want to do in the Sejm. The application signed by all #Konfederacja deputies and part of the PiS club was considered positive. Life won! Life is the most important! Artur Dziambor triumphed then.
2576	9	"Two days later, the politician published a special statement. ""In my opinion, a complete ban on abortion and forcing women to give birth, for example, to children without a brain, cannot take place in a civilized country. I perceive such situations as inhuman"" - he argued."
2576	11	The issue of permissibility of abortion is so important that there is no room for understatement. To be clear about my position on this matter:
2576	13	As a conservative, I am opposed to the liberalization of abortion law. Every human life is of the highest value to me. Therefore, I believe that the current abortion compromise contained flaws. Thursday's decision of the Constitutional Court should contribute to correcting them. I can't imagine that the current legal situation will end the discussion.
2576	15	The previously functioning premise of a probable defect of the child should be replaced with the certainty of a lethal defect. Such a provision will ensure that women will not be doomed to carry children who have no chance of life outside the mother's organism, or whose lives will be short and full of suffering. At the same time, it will give a chance for a happy life for children with, for example, Down syndrome. In my opinion, a complete ban on abortion and forcing women to give birth to, for example, brainless children cannot take place in a civilized country. I find such situations inhumane.
2576	17	At the same time, I believe that we should develop regulations as soon as possible to support families who bring up children with disabilities. Such assistance should be specific and real and should not be limited only to the financial sphere. This is one of the few situations in which I am ready to support the state's social solutions.
2576	19	I declare my willingness to work on such bills and call on politicians from all parties to the dispute to join and support this path.
2576	21	I know that my position may not satisfy part of the right, not to mention the extreme left on the other side. In this case, however, I am not primarily a politician. I am first and foremost a husband, father, father-to-be and human being. I follow what my conscience tells me.
2576	23	Below is the statement of the KORWiN Party on this matter.
2576	25	Dziambor was a guest of Tok FM today, where he emphasized that all parties should agree on the possibility of abortion. – I was pleased with the ruling of the Constitutional Court. Now take the second step. The entire political class, from the right to the left, should sit down and get along, he said.
2576	27	The politician stressed again that abortion should be allowed at certain moments. – If we are talking about children with lethal defects, I would like, and I think we all would like, parents to be able to decide whether to carry such a child to term with full knowledge that this child will not survive outside the mother's womb, or to remove it earlier – he said.
258	1	Comment: Mariupol - the city of Russian disgrace
258	3	This port city in the Donbass has become a symbol of the extermination war that Russia is waging against Ukraine. But the occupation is not the end of Mariupol's Ukrainian history.
258	5	In these days, the darkest chapter in the history of Mariupol ends. Ukrainian fighters leave the Azov steelworks after almost three months of resistance. This was a record in Russia's war with Ukraine, which began with the annexation of Crimea. Only Donetsk airport was defended even longer in 2014 and 2015. However, the situation in Mariupol was more difficult because Ukraine could not militarily help the besieged.
258	7	Some Ukrainian fighters leave the bunkers right next to the steelworks, others are carried out on stretchers, and still others stay to be the last to surrender - or die. Those who chose slavery hope to be exchanged for Russian soldiers captured by the Ukrainian army. Whether it will succeed is difficult to predict. Russia is clearly taking its time and is using Ukrainian prisoners of war for humiliating propaganda.
258	9	Mariupol - the name of the city located on the shores of the Sea of ​​\u200b\u200bAzov is known throughout the world today. This will be mentioned on the first pages of books on the history of Russia's war with Ukraine, which is a brutal war of attrition. Mariupol is the first major Ukrainian city to be completely destroyed by the Russian army, systematically and without regard to civilian casualties. It was quickly surrounded, but did not surrender, but resisted and thus became a model for the Ukrainian will to self-determination. Mariupol was the only major city in previously occupied southern Ukraine to put up such strong resistance. Kyiv will have to think about it.
258	11	The exact number of deaths in the city, which was inhabited by about half a million people before the war, is not yet known, but it can be feared that it reaches tens of thousands. After weeks of incessant shelling, hardly a single apartment building was left unscathed. This is undoubtedly a war crime.
258	13	Why Russia attacked Mariupol so brutally
258	15	From the first day of the war, Mariupol, along with Kharkiv and Kiev, was one of the three most fiercely fought cities. Why Mariupol? Primarily because of its strategic importance. Mariupol is the second most important industrial center in Donbass after Donetsk and an important commercial port. In the spring of 2014, it shared the fate of Donetsk and Luhansk and was occupied by pro-Russian separatists for several weeks, but was quickly liberated by the Ukrainian army. Since then, the front line ran several kilometers from the city. Two local industrial giants, Azov Steel and Ilyich Metallurgical Combine, were able to continue production.
258	17	For eight years, the inhabitants of Mariupol lived on a powder keg. However, with the exception of an attack in January 2015 that killed more than 30 people, the city was spared and suffered no further casualties or damage. At that time, Mariupol became the center of the Russian-speaking but pro-Ukrainian Donbas. The blue and yellow flags were a thorn in the eyes of those who wanted to see Mariupol as part of the regions that are actually occupied by Russia with the help of the separatists. This is also the reason for the special cruelty of the Russian army. In addition, the location of Mariupol, which is in the land belt connecting Russia with the annexed Crimea, plays an important role. Creating such a land link is one of Russia's obvious goals in this war.
258	19	"Finally, another very important reason is the fact that Mariupol was the headquarters of the Azov Regiment, founded by radical nationalists. It was they who played a decisive role in the liberation of the city in 2014. The very existence of the Azov Regiment, a small but well-known and well-armed unit of the Ukrainian National Guard, has been the main topic of Russian propaganda for years. Ever since Russia announced ""denazification"" as its official war goal, the Kremlin has been trying to destroy all whom it calls ""Nazis."""
258	21	Trial of Russian war criminals in Mariupol.
258	24	The price Mariupol had to pay for this is outrageous. In the memory of world history, Mariupol is remembered as one of the cities that was almost completely destroyed as a result of hostilities. The battle for Mariupol will be remembered for the harrowing shelling of the maternity clinic from which bloody mothers were carried out, as well as the bombing of the theater, in the basement of which civilians took refuge and died. These photos will never be forgotten. Mariupol became a city of Russian disgrace.
258	26	However, the occupation by the Russian army does not end the Ukrainian history of the city. Just as steel will be produced in Mariupol again, so will the Ukrainian flag fly there one day. But the most grim chapter in the city's history will only be finally closed when the war criminals who carried out this brutal conquest are brought to justice. There are already voices calling for the establishment of an international tribunal not in The Hague, but on the spot in Mariupol. There are too many witnesses to the crimes committed by the Russian military in Ukraine.
2580	1	"""Abortion should be legal, safe and cost-free."" Vote in the Sejm soon, who will be in favor?"
2580	3	"Until the end of June, the Sejm has time to deal with the civic project legalizing abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy. How will MPs vote? The ""Legal abortion. No compromises"" committee has set up a website where you can check it out. It is already known that one of the KO deputies is against it"
2580	5	Two sittings of the Sejm are scheduled for June: 8-9 and 22-23 June. During one of them, the civic project to legalize abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy should have its first reading. The draft was submitted on April 1 and from that date the Sejm has 3 months to consider it (specifically, to start the proceedings). The Legislative Initiative Committee has collected over 200,000 signatures of citizens and citizens.
2580	7	The draft mainly assumes: access to abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy (on the National Health Fund), access to abortion after 12 weeks in the case of fetal defects or rape, decriminalization of abortion, extension of the prenatal examination package
2580	9	How will MPs vote? Will the project go to the committee (because PiS will consider that civic projects deserve at least this), or will it be rejected right away?
2580	11	Who for, who against?
2580	13	"In order to mobilize parliamentarians to make a clear declaration, the legislative initiative committee set up the website abortionanatak.pl, through which you can ""accusate"" MPs and ask them how they will vote. So far, 118 people have given their answer, 68 for YES (including 19 from KO, 44 from Left, 3 from PPS, 2 from Poland 2050) and 50 for NO."
2580	15	"Most MPs from PiS (41) and Konfederacja (7) did NOT answer, but there was also an MP from KO - Paweł Poncyliusz. This is not surprising, considering that he was in PiS not long ago, and yesterday - June 2 - he declared: ""I am certainly much closer to Korwin than to some of the postulates of the Together party."""
2580	17	YES was mainly the answer of the Left (44) and KO (17) deputies, but there were also two deputies of Poland 2050 - Hanna Gill-Piątek and Paulina Henning-Kloska.
2580	19	Małgorzata Tracz, MP of the Greens (KO), answered YES, with whom the conversation is below.
2580	21	Abortion is not something abstract, it's life
2580	23	Magdalena Chrzczonowicz, OKO.press: Why will you vote for?
2580	25	"Małgorzata Tracz, Zieloni, KO: The Greens have had legal abortion in their program for a long time. I myself and other Green politicians have long been involved in collecting signatures for projects such as ""Let's save women"". Abortion should be legal, accessible, safe and cost-free. This is a medical procedure. Women have the right to decide about their lives and health. I don't understand why someone took that right away from us. Like other European women, we deserve equal treatment."
2580	27	In 2021, the Civic Platform announced that it supports the right to abortion up to 12 weeks. Therefore, KO will vote for the project?
2580	29	I'm sure it is. For now, it's about sending the project back for further work. It will be crucial how PiS and the Confederation will behave - will they vote for or against the civic project? Will they throw hundreds of thousands of signatures of citizens and women into the trash?
2580	31	But even if the bill goes to the commission, it will probably get stuck there, because PiS will not vote for the right to abortion, since it has just tightened the law with the hands of the Constitutional Tribunal. However, in the latest Ipsos poll for OKO.press, support for the right to abortion among PiS voters has increased quite significantly.
2580	33	Each of us knows someone who needed an abortion for various reasons - sister, friend, cousin. Abortion is near, it's not something abstract, it's life. The 2020 ban made it impossible for these people to terminate their pregnancies. And we see a woman close to us suffering, in a very difficult situation, perhaps one who does not have the means to terminate pregnancies on her own. We see the drama. Pretty quickly, I think, we change our minds then.
2580	35	Hot potato
2580	37	The issue of abortion in the Sejm is not very convenient for anyone, which is why work on the bill is probably pushed to the last minute.
2580	39	PiS, although it has a clear position on this matter (after all, it is behind the tightening of the law in 2020), has to face the attempts of fundamentalists who want to ban abortion also in the case of rape and a ban on abortion pills. The civic project equating abortion with homicide was rejected in December 2021, also by PiS votes, but as many as 41 deputies from the ruling party were in favor of sending the project for further work (including two deputy ministers from the Ministry of Education and Science):
2580	41	PiS must also take into account the growing approval for the right to abortion in its own electorate. The Ipsos poll for OKO.press shows that the percentage of those who support the right to abortion up to 12 weeks increased among those voting for the ruling party by as much as 10 percentage points. in the last 1.5 years.
2580	43	"The topic is also inconvenient for PO, which for years tried to maneuver between conservatives in its own ranks (such as Joanna Fabisiak) and liberals, for whom the right to abortion is a European standard. For a long time, the PO supported the so-called ""abortion compromise"", i.e. a very restrictive act of 1993, which was in fact the result of a compromise only with the Catholic Church. The PO stubbornly referred to the ""conservative anchor"", Grzegorz Schetyna, the head of the PO in 2016-2020, wanted to include a ""compromise"" in the constitution."
2580	45	"Many will remember the blamage of the PO, whose several deputies did not vote in 2018 for Barbara Nowacka's project ""Let's save women"", which meant that the project collapsed. In the same vote, as many as 59 PiS MPs were in favor of sending the draft for further work (in accordance with the principle of giving civic projects a chance). Eight votes left:"
2580	47	"It was only in 2021 that the PO announced a ""new social contract"", abandoned the 1993 act and - under many conditions - opted for the right to abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy (provided that the woman is in an ""extremely difficult situation"" and consults psychologist and doctor):"
2580	49	However, there will still be a few MPs in the KO who will vote against the project. These include Paweł Poncyliusz (already declared it), Paweł Kowal (in 2021 he declared that he did not agree with the new position of PO) and Joanna Fabisiak (after the vote in 2018 she was suspended, but after the elections in 2019 she returned to KO).
2580	51	"The Left has no doubts about abortion, as well as smaller groups that, together with PO, are part of the Civic Coalition: Zieloni, Nowoczesna and Inicjatywa Polska (created on the basis of the draft liberalization of the abortion law ""Let's save women""). All these parties clearly support the right to abortion. Members of the Left and the Greens became members of the ""Legal abortion. No compromise""."
2580	53	"It is not clear how the MPs of Poland 2050 will behave. The leader of the party, Szymon Hołownia, is against the right to abortion, in the past he was even in favor of tightening the 1993 law. Since he entered politics, he has been a supporter of the referendum, and after 2020, restoration of the so-called ""compromise"". However, two MPs - Hanna Gill-Piątek and Paulina Henning-Kloska - have already declared their support for the project, it can also be assumed that Joanna Mucha will vote in this way. Opposition can be expected from Paweł Zalewski and Wojciech Maksymowicz."
2580	55	How will the PSL vote? Some folks, including Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, declare very conservative views on the right to abortion (in 2017, the head of the PSL declared that he would remove one of the grounds for abortion from the 1993 act, i.e. he would do the same as the Constitutional Tribunal did in 2020). PSL as a party is in favor of a referendum.
2580	57	Most of the MPs of the Confederation are abortion fundamentalists, although there is no discipline in the party. In the vote on December 2 - on the bill equating abortion with homicide - as many as 6 deputies voted against the rejection of the project, and only three for the rejection.
2580	59	What are the options?
2580	61	Of course, it is practically impossible to pass a bill on legal abortion in this parliamentary term, the bill has mainly a symbolic meaning.
2580	63	Our survey is discussed below.
2580	65	Therefore, we have two possibilities, which depend mainly on the behavior of PiS deputies:
2580	67	first: the bill is lost in the first reading, because PiS wants to finish the matter before the holidays, not to upset either its voters, the fundamentalist wing or the Church.
2580	69	"the second: the draft goes to the committee (because ""civic projects should have a chance"") and there it gets stuck until the elections in 2023. It is worth noting that the civic projects on which work is in progress are carried over to the next term of office of the Sejm - they are not subject to the principle of discontinuation."
2580	71	88 percent KO voters for liberalization
2580	73	In the latest Ipsos poll for OKO.press (May 10-12, 2022), 66 percent. Polish women and men opted for the right to abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Down the columns are mainly PiS voters, but support has increased there too - from 24 percent. in 2020 to 34 percent. currently. Voters of all other parties support abortion rights:
2581	1	A referendum on abortion? Scheuring-Wielgus: We do not talk about human rights in referenda
2581	3	"Abortion is a human right, human rights should not be decided by a referendum, said Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, vice-president of the New Left, in TVN24's ""One for One"". In her opinion, ""abortion should be safe and accessible to a woman"" and ""a woman should have a choice""."
2581	5	On Wednesday, late in the evening, the first reading of the civic project to liberalize the abortion law took place in the Sejm. MPs will decide his fate in the voting block on Thursday.
2581	7	"The vice-chairman of the New Left, Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, was asked in ""One for One"" on TVN24 why her group is not striving to resolve the issue of abortion in a referendum. - Because we don't talk about human rights in referendums. The right to an abortion, the right to decide, is a human right, she replied."
2581	9	"In her opinion, ""abortion should be safe and accessible to a woman"" and ""a woman should have a choice"". - Yesterday one of the applicants said - and I agree with it - that this referendum on whether I want to get pregnant or not takes place in the toilet, when I check the pregnancy test. Then the woman decides whether to carry the pregnancy to term or not. The end of the period - said the MP."
2581	11	Scheuring-Wielgus: in the end, you have to look at abortion in such a way that it is a medical procedure
2581	13	"She said that the bill being processed in the Sejm was ""new and different from the previous ones"". - We decided, as people who participated in its creation, that abortion must be viewed in such a way that it is a medical procedure. Not to mention whether a 13-year-old, a 14-year-old or a 15-year-old gets pregnant. This project is about a woman's choice, about a woman's decision, stressed Scheuring-Wielgus."
2581	15	"She noted that ""by submitting a project on abortion (...), we are also talking about sex education, which is not available at school."" – If there was sex education, if we educated our children at school about sexuality, about what bad touch is, about how they should protect themselves, there would be no such problems, awareness would be greater – she said."
2581	17	Scheuring-Wielgus: A 13-year-old girl has the right to decide whether to carry the pregnancy to term or not
2581	19	A 13-year-old girl has the right to decide - I say this as a woman and as a mother - whether to carry the pregnancy to term or not, said the MP. According to the draft, the decision to terminate a pregnancy could be taken by a person who has reached the age of 13. In the case of a minor under the age of 13 who expresses the will to terminate the pregnancy, the consent of the legal guardian would also be required or, if the guardian does not consent, the consent of the guardianship court.
2581	21	There was a case in Poland when a 13-year-old girl became pregnant, wanted to terminate it, her mother wanted to help her, and her father did not. The priest was also involved. Everyone was discussing what this girl should do. We believe that when a 13-year-old girl is pregnant, she has the right to decide about her own life and whether she will carry the pregnancy to term, she added.
2582	1	My abortion
2582	3	Maybe you don't know, but we have just started the Jubilee year.
2582	5	"It's been 30 years since we discussed the anti-abortion bill. And also - this is my personal little jubilee - 30 years since I have been writing about this act. While the entire civilized world has this discussion so long behind it that no one ever thinks to question a woman's right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy at all - the possible discussion is only about how far beyond the first trimester this right should extend - 2 countries that consider themselves to be part of the ""Western world"" are taking this road in the opposite direction. It's Poland and the USA."
2582	7	"In America, the fundamental 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs. Wade—declaring that the right to abortion falls within the constitutional right to privacy—is likely to be challenged this year by the current Supreme Court, where Trump has crammed a right-wing majority. With particular reference to Amy Coney Barrett: a Catholic who openly proclaims that her legal career is a means to a life goal of ""serving God."" Given our provincial complexes, I suspect the country's pro-lifers are very proud that on this particular issue - bending the constitution to limit women's rights - we managed to get ahead of America. However, it is worth noting this specific convergence: both in the USA and in Poland, anti-abortion bigots are aware that their archaic views are not supported by the majority of society, so they resort to court decisions shaped by political appointments."
2582	9	"In Poland, the way back in terms of women's rights was much longer, because the right to abortion for social reasons dates back to 1956. Interestingly, the liberalization of regulations - supplementing the grounds for termination of pregnancy with ""difficult living conditions"" - was not, contrary to the , as we often heard from women's rights advocates in the 1990s, part of the post-October thaw. The change in the law took place in April 1956 and was a response to the real threat posed to the life and health of Polish women by the powerful abortion underground, estimated at 300,000. treatments per year. In 1955, 80,000 women were admitted to hospitals in serious condition, with miscarriages started at home. so-called soap sickness - caused by the injection of a soap solution into the uterus - often resulted in acute kidney failure, which required immediate dialysis; mortality was as high as 70 percent."
2582	11	"I recall this ancient story, because it is worth realizing that even the Stalinist authorities had more consideration for women than the current authorities. The existence of the underground was treated as an argument to change the law - instead of baiting doctors and women with the police. What's more, the anti-abortion regulations currently in force by the will of Magister Przyłębska are an exact repetition of the Stalinist regulations included in the Act on the Medical Profession of 1950, signed by Bolesław Bierut. The conditions for the legality of abortion from 1956 are a threat to the woman's health (""life"" is not mentioned, because it goes without saying) and ""suspected pregnancy as a result of a crime""."
2582	13	"It is worth noting in this memoir publication that the bill, which gave birth to the so-called the 1993 abortion compromise was much stricter than Stalin's regulations. The bill submitted by a group of lunatics in March 1992 - called ""on the legal protection of the conceived child"" - did not provide for any exceptions to the ban on abortion; it only allowed not to punish a doctor for the death of a fetus as a result of ""actions necessary to avert the danger to the life of a pregnant woman""."
2584	1	ABORTION, STUPID
2584	3	White Christians don't want to scrape black women because they don't want to sit with them.
2584	5	While the question of whether Joe Biden really knows he runs America remains valid, the way he rules may be a source of envy for the left in many parts of the world. Especially where, for the last few decades, governments calling themselves left-wingers have eschewed a progressive agenda in principle.
2584	7	After the revolutionary Keynesian pro-development package, which was a complete rejection of Reaganomics (during the Reagan presidency economics was based on lowering taxes, lowering budget spending, limiting state interference in the economy and limiting inflation), Biden - or at least his administration - takes up issues of morals. Or rather - in the current state of emotions - ideological.
2584	9	"Abortion in the US has become, like in Poland, one of the fields of ideological warfare as a result of – again like in Poland – the offensive of the extreme right, which sees it as a way to politically activate bigots. In the US, this has the added dimension that the southern conservancy invented the murder of conceived children as a way to incite political activism in the ranks of right-wing Christians, when in fact it was to stop changes that would outlaw racial segregation, such as Christian colleges for whites only. However, since it was difficult to proclaim openly, ""Rise up to defend our right to racism"", in the late 1970s Republican strategist Paul Weyrich invented ""protect life"" as a banner under which to rally religious lunatics."
2584	11	"Since then, the Republican right wing has been trying in every way to overturn the landmark 1973 judgment in Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court held that ""the right to personal privacy is broad enough to include a woman's right to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."""
2584	13	"The constitutional guarantee of the right to abortion has so far been undermined mainly by state restrictions introduced by Republican-dominated state Congresses - in 2021 alone, they adopted over 500 such amendments. But recently, with Trump's docking of the Supreme Court with the ultra-Catholic mother-of-seven, Amy Coney Barrett, who replaced the legendary Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of progress and women's rights, who died in September, the possibility opened up to reverse the ruling in Roe vs. Wade. In mid-May, the Supreme Court, with a new conservative majority, agreed to hear a case over Mississippi's anti-abortion law - seen by both sides as a touchstone of the majority's future commitment to ""pro-life."""
2584	15	"However, the other side is also gaining strength. Four years of Trumpism have moved the Democratic Party clearly to the left – also in the moral sphere. And it was followed by the new president - who was a rather conservative politician for most of his life. In 1973, as a novice senator, Biden ruled that the Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade ""went too far"" and even once voted for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the sentence. He was also - until last year - a supporter of a kind of American ""abortion compromise"", i.e. the so-called Hyde's corrections."
2584	17	This is a formula adopted in the late 1970s, added to each successive state budget since 1980, prohibiting the financing of abortion from federal funds. The amendments to the amendment adopted in the following years led to a legal construction similar to the anti-abortion act in Poland after the Przyłębska tribunal: only a pregnancy that threatens the woman's life or that results from rape or incest can be terminated at the state's expense.
2584	19	Which in practice means that access to abortion, although guaranteed by the constitution, was limited to well-to-do people. For the 15.6 million women who benefit from free health insurance, guaranteed by the public Medicaid program for poorer Americans, the cost of abortion often proved unbearable. Added to this were state restrictions aimed at closing down more clinics through various absurd requirements, e.g. determining the minimum width of the corridor or the maximum distance from the hospital. As a result, 6 states have only one particularly persistent abortion clinic, to which patients have to commute hundreds of miles. And the cost of abortion increases with the duration of the pregnancy - from $400-500 at 10 weeks to $1,100-1,650 at 20 weeks - resulting in a vicious circle:
2584	21	poor women trying to raise money for abortions find out every week that they need more and more.
2584	23	According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, one in four Medicaid clients admitted that they carried their pregnancy to term not because they wanted to have a child, but because they could not afford to terminate it.
2585	1	LEGAL ABORTION. “IN THIS VOTE THE CHOICE WAS VERY SIMPLE OR YOU ARE FOR WOMEN OR AGAINST THEM”
2585	3	Civic draft law “Legal abortion. No compromises” was rejected by the Sejm in the first reading. This happened thanks to the votes of MPs from PiS, the Confederation, the Polish Coalition, the Agreement and partly Poland 2050. The entire club of the Left supported the civic project, which was signed by 201,735 Polish women and men.
2585	5	"In this vote, the choice was very simple, either you are for women or against them. ""Safe abortion. No compromises” was not a radical project, but a law that was supposed to restore dignity and a sense of security to Polish women, which they have not had for over 30 years."
2585	7	It is a project that is a European standard, based on facts and science. I would like to thank all the women's organizations that were involved in the civic committee of the bill and in recent months have been collecting signatures and actively working, conducting educational talks and involving various circles in the collection of signatures. Thank you to each and every person who got involved in helping.
2585	9	Yesterday something absolutely scandalous happened, women and activists who came to the Sejm to listen to the reading of the bill were locked in the cloakroom, as if in a cage. Dangerous women in a cage at 11 pm and kept there until the last moment, until you start reading the draft. This is absolutely outrageous. And today, some of these activists were not admitted, despite the fact that they had previously received written permission to be present during the voting. PiS is so terrified of the abortion debate that it is holding it at midnight. PiS is so terrified of women that it has to lock them in cages, said MP Katarzyna Kotula.
2585	11	265 members of the PiS coalition, a coalition that hates women, voted against passing this project on for further processing. The attitude of PiS and Confederation deputies does not surprise us. We know that they lied when they said that all citizens' bills would always go to second reading. What surprises us, however, is the extension of this coalition, the fact that Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz or Mr. Paweł Kowal signed up for it. A great many different Members of Parliament decided that they would be happy to side with those who sent anti-terrorists against us, beat us and gassed us in the streets.
2585	13	I wonder what the price is in the case of PSL, maybe it's because this party is below the threshold and perhaps its last chance is to enter a coalition with PiS.
2585	15	The PiS coalition in the parliament has 265 sabers and includes 19 PSL deputies and those deputies who did not have the courage to vote for them and only took out their cards and pretended that they did not have them, like Paweł Kowal.
2585	17	"Abortion in Poland will finally be legal, supported by more than 66 percent of the society - said Magda Lempart, the civic draft of the law ""Legal abortion. No compromise""."
2585	19	Abortion Without Borders is back to work and will continue to help with abortions. 22 29 22 597 - you can call seven days a week, we will help and pay for the procedure. We will help partners, wives, daughters and lovers as well as sisters of PiS and Confederation MPs. We won't ask why. We help everyone, even those who do not respect us. We are in solidarity - said Natalia Broniarczyk, Aborcyjny Dream Team.
2586	1	BAN ABORTION KILLS. A 37-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DIED, LEAVES THREE CHILDREN
2586	3	The tragic story of a 37-year-old woman was described by her family on social media. Mrs. Agnieszka, being pregnant with twins, went to the Provincial Hospital in Częstochowa on December 21, 2021, in the Gynecology Department, the reason was vomiting and disturbing abdominal pain. On December 23, 2021, the first of the twins died, unfortunately, the doctors did not remove the dead fetus, justifying it with the regulations in force in Poland. On December 29, the second of the twins was pronounced dead. Both dead fetuses were removed only on December 31, so for 9 days there was a dead fetus in Mrs. Agnieszka's body, and for the next two days she was already carrying two dead fetuses that were removed from her body by hand. As a consequence of these events, on January 23, 2022, Agnieszka died.
2586	5	- Throughout all this time, Agnieszka carried the decomposing bodies of fetuses inside her. According to the test results and family reports, Mrs. Agnieszka fell ill in the hospital as a result of these activities, said MP Katarzyna Kotula at a press conference. - The ban on abortion killed Agnieszka! But the ban on abortion did not fall from the sky and today we need to remember who is responsible for the death of another woman. These are the deputies who signed the application to the Constitutional Tribunal. This is President Jarosław Kaczyński, who said that after all, every average-brained person will find access to an abortion procedure, stressed the MP.
2586	7	Not one more
2586	9	We will not leave these matters unexplained. We will not allow fanatics and barbarians to dictate how we should live. We will not let them cause us to live in fear. You can count on us - said MP Marcelina Zawisza, who announced that a joint meeting of the parliamentary health and justice committees on the case of Mrs. Izabela from Pszczyna will be held today. - We will fight, we will defend you, because we also defend ourselves, we defend every woman who lives in this country and we will not allow you to orphan more children.
2586	11	Abortion in Poland
2586	13	Abortion ban killed another woman. The situation is dramatic because the entire state is against them, the judiciary, the Constitutional Tribunal, the ruling party. Unfortunately, women cannot expect anything good from doctors or medical workers either. How could a woman be allowed to carry a dead fetus inside her for 7 days just because the other fetus was still alive? - commented MP Wanda Nowicka. - Doctors in Poland are intimidated by the current authorities. Is it really so that women in Poland are to be completely deprived of any help? she asked. - This is a state that sentences pregnant women to death. We don't agree, she said.
2586	15	Legal Abortion. No compromises - join the collection of signatures
2586	17	"The Left, out of concern for women's lives, proposes two legislative solutions. - The only real salvation for women is the adoption of the law on legal, acceptable and safe abortion in Poland - said Magdalena Biejat, emphasizing that it is possible in the long term. According to the MP, the crisis solution for now is the ""Rescue Act"", which decriminalizes aiding and abetting abortion."
2586	19	"Today, women are not punished for abortion, but their relatives and doctors are. The draft ""Rescue Act"" assumes the abolition of criminal liability for third parties in full in connection with termination of pregnancy."
2586	21	"MPs of the Left propose to delete from the Criminal Code Art. 152, which puts him in prison for instigating and assisting an abortion. These provisions have a ""chilling effect"", it is because of this article that women are afraid, for example, to tell their mother or friend about their abortion, because they are afraid that showing them support by loved ones may be risky for them. Article 152 means that every gynecological examination has the specter of a prosecutor, and any doctor who wants to fight for a woman's life and health can be prosecuted. - This is a law that we can all agree on, which will remove this fear from doctor's offices, which will allow doctors to stand unequivocally and decisively on the side of their patients - assessed Biejat."
2586	23	The Rescue Network
2586	25	We want to say to all women, to all families immersed in fear and terror: you are not alone and you can count on us. Together with the Federation for Women and Family Planning, we have prepared the Parliamentary Rescue Network. Every time there is a situation where a pregnant woman cannot get the help she needs, we are there for you and we will intervene so that this help is provided - said Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk.
2587	1	On the side of Poland. The Confederation launched a program offensive
2587	3	"The Confederation launched the program offensive ""On the Side of Poland"", during which the politicians of the group will meet with voters in 16 voivodship cities. They will convince to its anti-inflationary postulates, the development of the energy sector and the defense industry."
2587	5	"In an interview with PAP, Confederation MP Robert Winnicki reminded that last year's program offensive of the Confederation ""Poland anew"" was based on five basic postulates: ""low and simple taxes, efficient and accessible health care, effective and modern education, lower costs of living and the state laws"". According to Winnicki, this offensive brought the party ""very good results and a stable increase in ratings."""
2587	7	"As he added, the July offensive launched on Friday, entitled ""On Poland's Side"", is to be a response to new challenges, especially to ""smothering raging inflation"". In this regard, the Confederates will present a package of their own bills, such as ""Cheap electricity"", ""Cheap coal"", ""Cheap fuels"", i.e. in line with the group's consistently postulated reduction of taxes and the cost of living."
2587	9	According to the deputy, further program demands are the Confederation's response to the war in Ukraine and the need to strengthen Poland's security. – We are strong opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, we are strong supporters of building a strong and modern Polish army. And the fact that we want to base our security on the Polish army, on the Polish arms industry, is not a pro-Russian thesis, it is a pro-Polish thesis, Winnicki noted.
2587	11	In this context, the MP pointed to the need to urgently restore defensive capabilities, including anti-aircraft, anti-missile and artillery defense. “We focus on the Polish arms industry, not foreign purchases,” he stressed.
2587	13	"Speaking about the postulate of ""increasing the military capabilities of Poles"", Winnicki argued that ""every Pole over the age of 16 should be provided with the opportunity to take part in basic, free military training"". He also supported the liberalization of the right to bear arms. “Disarmed Poland is a state we oppose and we intend to fight against it,” he declared."
2587	15	"The MP admitted that the Confederation opposed ""social immigration, brought to Poland only so that the Polish state would pay immigrants for the mere fact of staying there."" According to him, this system is leaky, which means that ""Ukrainians can collect Polish benefits while staying in Ukraine and even in another EU country."""
2587	17	"Winnicki emphasized that the Confederation considers a possible Polish-Ukrainian Union to be ""fantasy"", which - as he stipulated - does not preclude Poland from supporting Ukraine, ""but with the effective defense of its own interests, also in the identity, historical and symbolic layer."""
2587	19	– We unequivocally demand that the state authorities reject the cult of Stepan Bandera and recognize the Volhynia massacre as genocide. We also expect full respect for the rights of the Polish national minority in Ukraine, he declared.
2587	21	"When asked about the plans for an official election campaign before the parliamentary elections and the already intensifying rivalry between its two main participants - PiS and PO, the MP noted that ""a permanent election campaign is underway in Poland""."
2587	23	- Konfederacja - as the only party - had the courage to oppose the generally applicable trends regarding lockdown policy during the pandemic and money printing, which is the main cause of inflation. We also have the courage to oppose the narrative that Poland must now become some kind of Polish-Ukrainian federation due to the outbreak of war in Ukraine. I think that voters will appreciate it in the upcoming elections - said Winnicki.
2587	25	"He also pointed out the growing percentage of ""unconvinced"" voters in opinion polls, whom the Confederation wants to reach and ""encourage"" in the face of - as he said - the significant ""wear and tear of the current power and the unreliability of the opposition led by Donald Tusk""."
2587	27	"Winnicki assessed that in such a situation, ""2023 is - perhaps as never before - a chance to break the duopoly (PiS-PO)"". – We are sharpening our teeth to break this duopoly and we feel that it is possible. We want people who are undecided as to political choices to be convinced that the Confederation is the answer to the atrophy of the political class that we are dealing with in Poland. The Confederation has to propose a program of governing the state differently than it has done so far. And I think that Poles expect it,” said Winnicki."
2588	1	Putin gave his voice. The French are shaking their pants again?
2588	3	"The official position of France, visible in the media, is similar and expresses support for the attacked Ukraine. However, as in President Macron's statements, a certain duality of attitudes can be seen here, it is not absolute support, and one can see the desire not to close the road to a ""peace dialogue"" with Moscow. There is even disbelief in the final success of Ukraine, traditional anti-Americanism and pro-Russian sentiments."
2588	5	Scaring and quoting Russian propaganda
2588	7	"The daily ""Le Parisien"" threatens that ""Vladimir Putin does not intend to stop there"" and ""is intensifying the bombing in eastern Ukraine, where his army is advancing into the Donbass"". In addition, it ""challenges the West."" ""We haven't started serious things yet,"" Putin's ""warning"" is quoted by a French newspaper."
2588	9	"“We hear that they want to defeat us on the battlefield. Let them come!” – the French quote Putin's defiant statements in the Kremlin during a meeting with parliamentarians ""against Americans and Europeans who are increasing the supply of heavy weapons to Ukrainian forces."""
2588	11	Americans are the worst
2588	13	"A completely scandalous text appeared in the right-wing weekly Valeurs, where the longing for friendship with Russia has clearly not died out. Journalist Meriadec Raffray almost quotes Russian propaganda about ""Americans fighting to the last Ukrainian."" In his opinion, the war in Ukraine is an ""intermediate global strategy of the United States"", ""implemented in 2014 and now taken over by Washington with the risk of spiraling tensions."""
2588	15	"“Behind every strike of the Kiev troops is the invisible hand of Uncle Sam. At the very beginning of the invasion, thanks to his information, the defenders were able to thwart an audacious operation by Russian helicopters (200 flying machines) to seize the Gostomel airfield, northwest of the Ukrainian capital. In mid-April, without the P-3 Orion sea patrol aircraft, the cruiser ""Moscow"" would not have been hit by Neptune missiles fired from the coast, the journalist states, referring to the defeat of the Russian landing at the airport near Kiev and the sinking of Putin's flagship."
2588	17	"It goes on to say that ""without the Americans, the Ukrainians would also have failed to attack Russian generals at the front"" and ""a network of commandos and spies is coordinating military support for Ukraine in Europe."" It is about the stream of American money, the training of Ukrainian troops in ""a dozen countries"", and all this to ""bleed the Russian bear""."
2588	19	"The author writes directly about ""American interference"". He points out that ""Since February, the Capitol has spent a whopping €60 billion, which is one and a half times the annual budget of the French army."" But ""that's not all, because at the same time, much more discreetly, the Americans are making a military takeover of Ukraine"", where ""for years they have been deploying means for waging war through their proxies."""
2588	21	"Of course, it all started with the CIA operation on the Maidan. ""The goal was to replace President Viktor Yanukovych with a leader ready to cut the umbilical cord with Moscow."" ""Weeks later, the Donbass rose up and Washington stepped up its meddling, notably by sending a number of American (and British) military advisers to the front."""
2588	23	For and even against
2588	25	"Raffray does not see who the aggressor is, he forgets about the ""little green men"" in Donbass, and only waits for his arguments to be quickly reprinted and summarized by, for example, TASS and RIA Novosti. However, such propaganda reaches the French, although the local RT has been closed."
2588	27	"What the pro-Russian and anti-American journalist writes directly, the rest of the media reports in a balanced way and officially takes the side of Kiev. Le Figaro's headline, ""Ukraine: Relentless Bombing of Donetsk, New American Aid,"" nevertheless completes Raffray's argument. No intrusive propaganda, but the pronunciation is the same."
2588	29	"Between the lines you can additionally read that ""imports and purchases of Russian goods in France have doubled in value, due to the increase in energy prices."" And by the way, AFP reports that the Council of Europe Development Bank ""approved 465 million euros of loans to help host Ukrainian refugees"" and adds that ""these loans are mainly granted to Germany, up to 200 million euros, but also to Lithuania, Ireland and Spain ""."
2589	1	Sergei Lavrov and the swastika. The environment of the negotiations between Moscow and Ulaanbaatar excited social networks
2589	3	Categories:
2589	5	“Maria, who posted the photo, did not have the intelligence to remove the pot from the frame. Look down. Lavrov in Mongolia,” write social media users, posting a photo of the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh, where a vase with a golden swastika was in the center of the frame.
2589	7	She published an ambiguous photo on July 5 this year. in her Telegram channel, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova.
2589	9	“Negotiations between the head of the Russian delegation, Sergey Lavrov, and the President of Mongolia in Ulaanbaatar. For distinguished guests, a yurt has been installed in the state palace, ”Zakharova wrote without mentioning the name of the head of the Mongolian state and focusing on the central element with an ancient symbol that is controversial in Europe and used by Russian propaganda in its message.
2589	11	"And Zakharova's readers, predictably, were most interested not in the essence of the Moscow negotiations with Ulaanbaatar, but in the swastika next to Lavrov: ""There is a swastika on the samovar, or what?!"", ""There is a swastika on the samovar"", ""what is this pot and is it this is ridiculous?"". “On a vase you can, on a body you can't…” – others point to the practice of filtration camps for Ukrainian refugees. “This swastika has a completely different meaning. This is our Slavic sign. Hitler screwed him up,” writes a third, unashamed of their ignorance. Some are closer to black humor and trolling: ""Mongolia is the cradle of neo-Nazism, time to de-Nazize."""
2589	13	However, among many perplexed commentators, there were those who tried to explain that the famous solar symbol had been one of the national symbols of Mongolia since ancient times, long before the leaders of the Third Reich gave it other meanings.
2589	15	"""The swastika icon is present among the Tamg Khakass, Tuva and Buryat, and is equated by scientists with the concept of happiness,"" so those who are somewhat familiar with the traditions of the region are trying to stem the wave of indignation."
2589	17	However, references to local traditions do not work if you regularly watch Russian TV. “I demand that Zakharova be locked up for 7 years for demonstrating extremist Nazi symbols! Shame!”, some fans of Moscow geopolitics react in the parameters set by the Russian “right”.
2589	19	"Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, Article 20.3. it states that ""propaganda or public display of Nazi paraphernalia or symbols, paraphernalia or symbols of extremist organizations, or other paraphernalia or symbols whose propaganda or public display is prohibited by federal law."" The comrade major needs to compile administrative materials regarding the person who posted this photo,” other commentators call for consistency and the launch of the Russian law enforcement system."
2589	21	"""A meeting under the sign of the swastika? Yes, keep it up, no illusions” – one of the readers of “Zakharova” reconciles the tradition of Mongolia with the practice of the current leaders of the Russian Federation."
2589	23	At the same time, Sergei Lavrov at the meeting in one of the first phrases again spoke about the times of the struggle against German Nazism.
2589	25	“We are united by a common history, military brotherhood, forged and hardened in the years of fighting against Nazism and militarism. Today, with Minister B. Battsetseg (Mongolia's Minister of Foreign Affairs), we discussed the task you mentioned about the need to ensure that the historical truth remains forever in the memory and hearts of all generations of citizens of Russia and Mongolia,” he said at the meeting with the president Mongolia Sergey Lavrov.
2589	27	"""The visit took place in an atmosphere of warm and trust, traditional for Russian-Mongolian relations, which confirmed the mutual focus on dynamically building cooperation in practical areas and deepening coordination on the world stage,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an official statement."
2589	29	"As for the Nazi symbols and the modern symbols of the Russian army, the famous ""Z"" sign was also used by the Nazis during the Second World War to mark their units."
2592	1	Stanisław Michalkiewicz: 600 billion dollars for the export of communism
2592	3	"""Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes"" - I am afraid of the Greeks even when they come with gifts. These words were put by Virgil in the mouth of the Trojan priest Laocoön when he saw the famous Trojan horse. On Sunday, June 26, in one of the Bavarian castles, dignified heroes of the world, i.e. representatives of countries considered to be the richest: France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the United States, Japan and Canada, as well as the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, gathered in one of the Bavarian castles. Until recently, Russia also took part in these meetings, but now not anymore, because since Putin was declared a war criminal by the US Senate, President Biden has no intention of sitting at the same table with him, perhaps for fear of becoming zoned, which - as you know, it is worse than death. But Putin had already consoled himself by attending the BRICS summit in Beijing, attended by countries not as reputable as Italy, but representing over 3 billion people. This is, of course, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. With more than 3 billion people, this is quite a large market, allowing Russia not only to maintain exports of energy resources and other goods, e.g. the more that countries that do not participate in the BRICS, but also wealthy ones, such as Saudi Arabia, do not think about joining the sanctions against Russia. As a result, Putin can easily circumvent them, especially since the Beijing BRICS summit was in favor of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, but who knows whether such negotiations will take place at all. Firstly, the United States wants to fight in Ukraine with Russia to the last Ukrainian in order to “weak” Russia, as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin frankly admitted during his Kiev pilgrimage. What exactly does this mean, he confessed - Esperons that sober - the Ukrainian defense minister - that it is about the demilitarization of the European part of Russia. Secondly, Putin does not even hide his intention to partition Ukraine in the form of cutting off its industrialized eastern regions and the Black Sea coast, which he has already occupied almost all thanks to the invasion. Then - thirdly - President Zelensky probably cannot enter into negotiations on the ""acceptable"" partition of Ukraine without bringing a political catastrophe on his head and his surroundings. In this situation, the war is entering a protracted phase and God only knows how long it will last. Since we know this, it is difficult for the BRICS participants to be aware of it, who apparently treated their support for the negotiations as a fig leaf, behind which they supported Russia, as evidenced by the adoption of a diagnosis of the cause of this war by China. According to the Chinese, it was pushing the expansion of military alliances, without taking into account the reservations of other countries. It is worth recalling that after NATO enlargement in 1999 to Central Europe, Kondoliza declared that the USA would not force the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to NATO, but would only guard ""democracy"" there - because at that stage the United States was still an exporter of democracy . It is interesting that a similar to the Chinese diagnosis of the cause of the war in Ukraine was presented by Pope Francis, which infuriated Mr. Tomasz Terlikowski, because nothing is worse than the truth, as noted by Stefan Kisielewski."
2592	5	"As you can see, China, which is the world's leading economy and has much more to offer other countries than Russia, has gained considerable influence in Africa and South America, which traditionally looks at the United States with suspicion. But the United States, not to mention the other participants of the G7 summit, are doing what they can to oppose this Chinese expansion, preferably with the help of bribery. As they do, so do we. Therefore, President Jozio Biden proclaimed the ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure"" and promised that the participants of the G7 group will spill gold worth USD 600 billion, of which the US will provide USD 200 billion, and the rest - the rest. On the surface, it looks extremely promising, and I imagine the bureaucratic gangs of the ""developing"" countries already seeing in their mind's eye what fortunes they will carve out of the very dust that is created by counting such money. However, it is known that who pays - demands - and President Biden, on the occasion of the proclamation of this ""Partnership"", confessed that he will not shower gold on developing countries at random, but will allocate the money for predetermined goals. Of course, you can also fish, so it would not be a cause of concern and restraint on the part of those showered. But the point is what those goals are. Namely, the so-called critical elements of global stabilization: health, health security, gender equality and digitalisation."
2592	7	"Health, you know; who wouldn't want to be rich and healthy? But President Biden's health pledge coincides with an announcement that a bureaucratic gang called the World Health Organization is taking over a vast amount of power over people. The last two years have shown the whole world the dangers of succumbing to the power of this gang. Why, then, does President Biden put health first? Because by relying on the instinct of self-preservation, the World Health Organization contributed to the achievement of two or even three goals from the very beginning. The first is the takeover of dictatorial power by the governments, without looking at any constitutional bullshit, which no one even bothered to ""avoid"" or even ""suspend"". The second goal, which was easily achieved on this occasion, was for governments to take over the manual control of economies, without regard to property rights. As is known, it grants the owner, to the exclusion of other persons, the right to sovereignly manage the subject of his property. Meanwhile, governments, passing over property to order, shut down whole segments of the economy overnight. Both, that is, the dictatorship of a bureaucratic gang and the manual control of economies, are identical to the goals set by the promoters of the communist revolution. In turn, ""health security"" is nothing more than the introduction of universal and compulsory health insurance, i.e. socialist health care, under which bureaucratic gangs will decide who will be allowed to live and who will not. If anyone else had any doubts as to whether this is a case of pushing the communist revolution on a global scale, they are dispelled by the announcement that the money transferred under the ""Partnership for Global Infrastructure"" will be used to finance ""gender equality"". As we know, so far genderology, which is a branch of the ""advanced science"" invented by Joseph Stalin, has discovered 77 genders - and this is of course not the last word in this field. For $200 billion, there will be explorers ready to discover new genders every day, as well as fiery champions of equality who will keep the equation, that is, they stretch the small ones, they cut the big ones, they squeeze the fat ones and puff up the skinny ones. In this way, the famous ""uravnilovka"" will be achieved, and the guarantee that there will be no turning back from all this will be ""digitization"", which is an elegant name for total surveillance."
2592	9	In this example, it is clear that the United States has become an exporter of the communist revolution before our very eyes. They try to make Negroes happy with it, that is, black people who, as perceptive people say, are red because they are still green. I wonder if they will realize in time with what gifts they come to them today, or if they will not, and then it will be too late.
2593	1	Postcard from Belarus - Information Portal STRIKE
2593	3	They're just impressions. Can you draw something based on this? Not everything, but some things for sure.
2593	5	Belarus after 2020 is still sore. I don't have any research on this topic (there are no public opinion polls in Belarus), but you can feel it. It's not scientific proof, but, between us, journalists rarely have the right to claim with full responsibility that something is definitely one way or another. They speculate rather than get to the heart of the matter. The charms of the profession.
2593	7	Is the Belarusian society, like the Polish one, divided today into two almost equal parts that hate each other? No, that's not true. There are certainly many dissatisfied people. But after the harsh repression of the authorities after the social protests in 2020, a significant number of them left, some were sentenced to lesser or greater sentences, and some simply withdrew into a kind of internal emigration, although I would caution against simple analogies with Poland after the introduction of the state military. And the others? Others do what they think is right.
2593	9	“There is a war. – a journalist from the official Belarusian media tells me when I grimace at the program of one of the symbols of the Belarusian official propaganda, Georgy Azarionka (Ryhora Azaronka) – People need a clear message. Someone had to start responding to the other side's arguments. What, can't you see what they're using? How do they lie, how do they encourage violence, how do they want blood to be spilled in Belarus?” The discussion at this level is not that it is pointless, but it will have no end. The more so that I am not an admirer of the Western propaganda drain, which I have been observing for years. However, I am unable to muster my enthusiasm for the level and form of such an information message. However, as my interlocutor says, people like it and want it. Perhaps, although I do not understand how it is possible to like it when someone on the vision chants patriotic songs, shouts, insults his antagonists. We will not reach an agreement. So we will not discuss, we will stick to our opinions.
2593	12	The streets of Minsk today are no different from the streets of other European cities. Maybe they're not that crowded. People go to work, cinemas, theaters, various events, concerts, pubs. Live. In the evenings, there are crowds of young people in pubs on Oktyabrska Street. This is the region of Minsk that can be compared, I don't know? with Warsaw's Nowy Świat or Powiśle with a multitude of cafes, music and crowds of mostly young people wandering from place to place.
2593	14	"The daughter of my friends, who are very critical of the Belarusian authorities, has just received a master's degree from her university. When asked if she planned to emigrate from Belarus, she categorically denied it. And yes, it is impossible to muster enthusiasm for the current authorities. But he shrugs off his parents' criticisms of the state in the sense of ""I know what I'm saying and I'm not going to agree with you."" Her company shows similar attitudes. They don't protest. They don't support. They are waiting. For what? They don't know exactly."
2593	16	"Russian Center named after Levada, a public opinion research center that opposes Putin, uses the category ""potential of protests"" among its research. Thus, sticking to this term, one can risk saying that the potential for protests in Belarusian society is low. Of course, also because a street protest today is associated with too much risk of repression. But these are not the only reasons."
2593	19	"Among the others is the composition of Belarusian society and the memory of its recent history. The wave of protests, apart from Minsk, also spread to other cities, albeit to a small extent compared to the capital. The village didn't even flinch. In 2020, the protesters counted on the support of their activities from the working class, in particular from large industrial plants. If the MAZ truck production plants, the Tractor Factory, and the potash mines were to stop for a longer period, the authorities would be in trouble. However, that did not happen. Attempts to organize strikes in large plants were ruthlessly suppressed in the bud. Besides, there was no unity among the workers themselves. They, like collective farm workers, appreciated the ""small stabilization"" created by Lukashenko. Maybe the wages weren't jaw-dropping, but they were enough. In addition, a rough but permanent social welfare: holidays from the workplace, summer camps for children, medical care, you don't have to wait for an ambulance for hours, in short, everything that older Poles remember from the times of the People's Republic of Poland. And Alexander Lukashenko himself. His peasant, maybe indiscriminate in language, maybe publicly humiliating ministers and scolding them in front of the cameras like schoolboys, but who among ordinary people did not feel at least a little satisfaction when high-ranking officials were publicly put on the line? The president of Belarus knows how to use his ""homeliness"" to the bottom, which is admitted even by his opponents. Belarusian society, mostly peasants, with a rural value system, a rational approach to life and an aversion to sudden, cardinal changes was the matter on which the ""Belarusian spring"" turned upside down. You can regret, you can get angry, you can be disappointed that the people of Belarus did not want to join either Europe or NATO right away, but you have to accept it. At least for now."
2593	22	Another factor that keeps Belarus where it has stopped is what has been and is happening beyond the southern border of Belarus. Since 2014, the official media have made a lot of effort to make Belarusian citizens look at Ukraine with fear: that prices are rising, that corruption, that the political class does not care about the political interest of its own state, but pursues someone else's, that historical policy negates the results of World War II, that supporters of UPA rehabilitation and Dmytro Dontsov's ideology are becoming more and more active. The employees of the ideological front did not have to make any effort: the pictures were at their fingertips, because it was indeed not difficult to convince the recipients that Ukraine was in fact a state in permanent crisis.
2593	24	At the same time, Lukashenka kept doing what he does best: balancing. He kept emphasizing that it is Russia that Belarus is the most faithful ally that they can always count on. He showed loyalty. At the same time, he refused to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, made biting remarks about Russia buying up Belarusian assets, and was able to unexpectedly demonstrate independence when detaining the Russian Wagnerians. Whether it was just a theater or whether the president of Belarus was really looking for his place in the Russian-Belarusian union state is irrelevant now. After August 2020, almost everything has changed. The Belarusian authorities received unequivocal support only from Russia. This obliges and binds the Belarusian authorities with Putin's team even more strongly.
2593	26	The war between Russia and Ukraine on February 24 set the accents once again. Because now, the majority of Belarusian society, regardless of their attitude towards the president, seems to share the view that Lukashenko's remaining in office after August 2020 saved Belarus from direct hostilities on its territory. They note this fact with undisguised relief. Of course, it is still possible for Belarus to enter the war if the values ​​of the federal state are threatened. Lukashenko himself has mentioned this several times, but he also declares that he is not interested in a war with Ukraine. He's balancing again.
2593	28	Belarus, although subject to a package of sanctions since August 2020, is not as strong as neighboring Russia. So it remains Russia's window to the world, or, if you prefer, a corridor between Western Europe and Russia. And China, which seems to be equally important, if not more important, for European industry and trade. Thus, although from time to time there are calls in the European political space to close Belarus from the West, somehow they do not find universal support and response. War is war, and trade and production must go.
2593	30	"If we summarize all that I have written above, it becomes clear that the aforementioned ""protest potential"" in Belarus is not only low at present, but also there is little chance that it will change to something else in the near future."
2593	32	There is also another factor that makes Belarus a territory where the ideological and propaganda offensive from the West is making poor progress. This is the history and consistent historical policy of the Belarusian authorities since 1994, that is from the moment when Alexander Lukashenko took the authorities into his big hands.
2593	34	It is not even that this policy was a simple continuation of the historical narrative of the times of the USSR. This is only part of the answer. The rest are facts that are hard to argue with. During World War II, every third citizen of Belarus gave his life. It's worth considering. Not every third soldier, every third partisan, every third adult. No, every third, including women, children, the elderly ... There is no family in Belarus that has not been bloodily touched by German Nazism. The German occupation is a sequence of unprecedented crimes against the civilian population, atrocities and planned purges. Belarusians remember this not only from school and the official historical narrative. They remember this at the genetic level, from family traditions. I have no grounds to deny the authenticity of emotions (after almost 80 years!) to the participants of the ceremony in Khatyn, a memorial site of 149 people, including 49 children, burned alive by the Germans and collaborators, although none of those present at the ceremony can remember those times. I was, I saw.
2593	36	"The Chatyn complex consists of a shocking monument to one of the inhabitants (Józef Kamiński), who miraculously survived, found among the corpses of his son, who died in his arms, and symbolic 26 chimneys from burnt huts. There is also a symbolic ""cemetery of villages"" burned by the Germans, just like Chatyń - along with their inhabitants. 185 graves."
2593	38	So they remember. The sacrifice of blood, persecution and martyrdom of entire villages. They also remember the Belarusian partisan movement, the Belarusian soldiers of the multinational Soviet army that saved them from certain annihilation, and probably the joy of victory. A memory shaped over the years.
2593	40	I assure you that it would be really difficult to convince a significant part of Belarusians, regardless of their contemporary views, that World War II was caused by their grandfathers and fathers, that they were occupiers, murderers and rapists, that the graves of the fallen do not deserve respect and gratitude. Not only because it's not true, but also because it's an attempt to pull one of the foundations of their society out from under their feet.
2593	42	Not that it's impossible. The history of propaganda knows not such results of brainwashing large groups of recipients (Poles are a good example of this). But it will certainly not be easy, apart from the moral assessment of such actions. The trials will certainly continue, because the desire to free Belarus from Russian influence is the West's wet dream.
2593	45	"Today, Polish-Belarusian relations are at an exceptionally low level. There are many mutual justified grievances, unhealed wounds. Recently, the media reported on the devastation of the graves of Polish soldiers in Mikuliszki and Kaczyce. The Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that ""military graves and burial places of foreign soldiers have not been registered in this area."" It also added that Belarus ""approaches all burial places on our land with special reverence"" and reminded that only this year in Poland 30 acts of vandalism were recorded against monuments of gratitude to people who gave their lives for the liberation of Poland from fascism, including desecration of a mass grave of 620 Soviet soldiers in Chrzowice."
2593	47	So we can wind up this spiral of resentment and hatred for each other. The times are exceptionally favorable for this. We can also try ourselves, without intermediaries, at least to get to know each other, if not to understand. This will pay off in the future.
2596	1	Chernobyl was not the first. Moscow hid the horrific catastrophe for years
2596	3	Russia turned off the gas taps. Will the atom help us? What are the risks
2596	5	While searching for green energy sources, we come across nuclear energy, which for years has divided people into staunch supporters and opponents. It has been known for a long time that nuclear power plants, together with hydropower plants, are the main source of low-emission energy, while many people look at the former only through the prism of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. What is the balance of the advantages and disadvantages of the atom and should we really be afraid of this technology?
2596	7	Global warming, caused mainly by high greenhouse gas emissions, is progressing more and more, and if we want to stop this process, switching to green energy sources seems to be an inseparable element.
2596	9	While obtaining energy from the sun, wind or rivers does not raise much controversy, the fission of the nuclei of atoms still inflames the crowds that do not want to have anything to do with this technology, often without going even deeper into the topic that really hides lots of interesting information.
2596	11	See also: How will global warming affect Poland directly?
2596	13	In the 1950s, the world's first nuclear power plant was built in the Soviet Obninsk, and soon other countries such as France, Germany, the United States and Great Britain were equipped with similar plants. Although it may seem like a relatively new technology, for example, the first wind farms appeared only several dozen springs later, in the early 1980s.
2596	15	Of course, the first reactors did not generate much power, although this aspect has improved year by year, thanks to which today they produce about 10 percent of the world's electricity. Among green sources, only hydro power plants are ahead of them in this respect.
2596	17	There are currently 440 reactors in operation in 32 countries around the world. By far the most energy is produced by those located in the United States, while nuclear power plants in France have the largest percentage share in the national energy sector, providing over 70 percent of the total demand.
2596	19	See also: Small nuclear reactors and coal-fired units in Poland's energy policy
2596	21	One of the greatest advantages of nuclear energy is the almost complete lack of emissions of all kinds of greenhouse gases. Small amounts of carbon dioxide will be produced during the construction of the power plant, and nuclear fission itself does not produce any additional greenhouse gas.
2596	23	In this way, this type of energy generation is ahead of even photovoltaics or hydro power plants in terms of lower carbon dioxide emissions. Of course, all these methods beat coal and gas power plants, which are the truest cinders of our planet.
2596	25	Unlike other green sources, the atom is not dependent on weather conditions, thanks to which we have full control over the amount of energy generated. It is also worth adding that the whole process is accompanied by much less noise than in the case of wind turbines, thanks to which it is not a nuisance to the local residents.
2596	27	Nuclear power plants also produce small amounts of waste, which, compared to their coal counterparts, are practically non-existent, as there are even hundreds of thousands of times less. It is also worth adding that the storage of such negligible amounts does not pose any significant problem for state authorities.
2596	29	See also: Ranking of the most polluting power plants. Poland and Germany in the lead
2596	31	There are only two major disadvantages of nuclear power plants - Chernobyl and Fukushima. It all boils down to the fact that a potential catastrophe can be unimaginably dangerous for all organisms in the vicinity and leave traces for the next few decades.
2596	33	Ukrainian Pripyat remains depopulated to this day, despite the fact that almost 40 years have passed since the events in Chernobyl. The nearby Red Forest even in 2022 led to the death of a person staying in the contaminated zone.
2596	35	Of course, there were more minor nuclear accidents, such as the Kishtina disaster in 1957, hidden for years by the Russians, which killed hundreds of people and made the nearby Karachay Lake the most polluted place on Earth at that time.
2596	37	However, these two aforementioned cases have been remembered by every person who is even slightly interested in this topic and will probably accompany everyone somewhere in the back of their minds, especially those living near nuclear power plants.
2596	39	It is worth noting that nuclear power plants are becoming safer year by year and it is extremely unlikely that the tragic history of the past will be repeated. Despite this, many people simply prefer to be safe when it comes to a red-hot atom.
2597	1	Andrzej Duda ignores the crushing climate report. Her thoughts are at Antek Królikowski's wedding
2597	3	On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) operating at the United Nations published an alarming report prepared by 234 scientists from around the world. It shows that we are on a collision course with the climate. Assuming the current path of CO2 emissions, the most likely temperature increase is 2.7 degrees Celsius in 2100. Such radical warming could threaten our civilization. Scholars call on world governments to take immediate action on the road to global zero-carbon (you can read about the conclusions of the IPCC report here).
2597	5	"The document did not go unnoticed. The conclusions of the IPCC were addressed by world leaders, including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who spoke of ""the last call for coal and fossil fuels before burning them will finally destroy our planet."""
2597	7	Meanwhile, the most important Polish politicians who shape the discourse in this country have completely ignored the IPCC report. They had two days to do it.
2597	9	"What was happening at that time? Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki talked about building roads, but did not mention a word about the alarming document. This is not a big surprise. From the beginning of his term, Morawiecki was a ""brake"" of the solutions proposed by the European Union in order to introduce the so-called Green Deal. For a long time, we were the only country that did not sign the declaration of climate neutrality by 2050. PiS put forward the interest of the entire state, not wanting to provoke miners with claims about the need to abandon coal."
2597	11	"Piotr is suing the State Treasury for climate change. ""Fires are raging near my house"""
2597	13	The exceptionally politically active Donald Tusk recently asserted that his years as president of the European Council had made his views more progressive. Meanwhile, he did not find time to spend 15 minutes. the issue of global warming. Instead, he threatened PiS again.
2597	15	Tusk likes to refer to the ideals of the EU, but apparently he has not noticed that climate policy is an absolute priority for Brussels. I just want to say to the deputy chairman of the KO that the climate crisis is not the sole fault of PiS. The PO-PSL governments have been subsidizing the coal industry for years, significantly contributing to global CO2 emissions.
2597	17	"The attitude of Andrzej Duda seems outrageous, since he managed to congratulate Joanna Opozda and Antoni Królikowski on his private Instagram account since the publication of the alarming IPCC report (he wrote: ""Congratulations to you and Agata. Plurimos annos! Happy days!"") and referred to death Russian dissident Sergei Kovalev. But he did not write a word about the climate. This should come as no surprise, given that Duda's earlier statements about climate were based on anti-scientific claims. He said that humans are not responsible for the rise in temperature, thus ignoring the consensus of climatologists. His adviser, Paweł Sałek, recently resorted to conspiracy theories, saying that the human impact on climate change is just a ""concept in the media space""."
2597	19	"The Ministry of Climate has been delaying the publication of any comment on the IPCC report for a long time, although it should sound the alarm in the first place. The ministry, instead of roaring, limited itself to a few-sentence statement that ""Poland, together with other European Union countries, is making significant efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (...), and these actions are taken not only in the sphere of declarations, but also the legal framework, which is reflected in the Fit for 55 package published by the European Commission in July."
2597	21	"Earlier, there were voices that the Ministry of Climate was established to create facade activities of the government for environmental protection. Political greewashing has found its confirmation. Minister Kurtyka does not have the competence and clout to hit the table with his fist and convene an extraordinary session of the Sejm. Its staff issued only a few propaganda entries, omitting the use of the phrases ""IPCC"" or ""climate catastrophe."" The ministry does not recognize global warming."
2597	23	It was only on Wednesday, two days after the publication of the IPCC, that MP Joanna Mucha (Polska 2050) raised the topic of the report on the Sejm rostrum, but with the votes of the members of the United Right, the Sejm rejected the motion to postpone the #lexTVN meeting and talk about IPCC instead.
2597	25	On behalf of the Left, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk and Robert Biedroń mentioned the climate, but even this - from the perspective of progressive voters - seems far from sufficient.
2597	27	If you care about the climate and do not want to be like Duda and other politicians, get involved in activist actions, because only they are able to force any change on passive politicians.
2597	29	One of the activist options is the International Climate Strike. This organization wants to force systemic change in Poland and the European Union as soon as possible, which is necessary to stop the climate catastrophe. They want to do this by harnessing the energy, moral mandate, and scale of youth mobilization that will increasingly follow comprehensive climate change education. Another solution is to get involved in other environmental movements. Both global ones, such as Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion, WWF, as well as local ones, close to where you live. Let us remember that in times of the deepening climate crisis, individual consumption choices (such as limiting plastic) are important, but not enough. International regulation is needed to stop global warming.
