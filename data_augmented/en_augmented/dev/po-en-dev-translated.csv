25106	1	Only with us: Greta Thunberg on the climate crisis
25106	3	Earth Day: Greta Thunberg on the climate crisis
25106	5	In an impassioned letter, an 18-year-old Swedish girl explains why world leaders must take more radical action to avert catastrophe.
25106	7	Greta Thunberg was only 15 years old when in August 2018 she started her weekly protests in front of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm. She couldn't understand why no one was talking about how big a problem the climate crisis was. Since then, the 18-year-old activist has mobilized millions of people to take to the streets, and has become one of the most recognizable faces of the environmental movement in the world.
25106	9	On Earth Day, April 22, 2021, during the climate summit organized by the President of the United States, Joe Biden, the leaders of the participating countries will present new commitments to combat the climate crisis, including a project to achieve zero emissions by 2050. They will call them ambitious projects. When we compare what the latest scientific advances offer us with the so-called climate goals, we see a serious gap - where we really need to act, we have a delay of decades.
25106	11	Of course, we should support all activities that are to ensure a secure future for us and protect against deterioration of living conditions. The goals presented at the summit could be a great starting point, if not for a small detail - they are full of loopholes and loopholes. Such as ignoring emissions from imported goods, aviation and international transport, and burning biomass. They make it possible to manipulate the output data, exclude feedback and tipping points, ignore the key aspect of fair share and historical emissions share. For this reason, these goals depend entirely on abstract calculations and virtually inaccessible technologies. I don't have time to go into details right now.
25106	13	The thing is, we can still use creative carbon accounting and cheat our calculations to pretend that the goals we set are what we need now. However, we must not forget that while it is possible to deceive others and even ourselves, nature and physics cannot be deceived. Whether we do our calculations honestly or not, emissions are a fact.
25106	15	"People in power are not held accountable because awareness of the issue is still low. This is the crux of the problem. If you call their commitments ""courageous"" or ""ambitious"", you do not fully understand how serious a situation we are in."
25106	17	I met many world leaders. Even they themselves admit that the goals they set do not correspond to the commitments they have made. It's completely natural. After all, they only do what they consider possible to do in connection with the political situation. Their job is to fulfill the wishes of the voters, and if voters do not demand real action to stop the climate catastrophe, it is obvious that nothing will change. Fortunately, that's how democracy works. It is public opinion that rules the free world. If we want change, we need to raise public awareness and show that what seems impossible can become possible.
25106	19	We understand that the world is complicated, that many people do what they can, and what we need is not easy. Of course, even insufficient goals are better than nothing. But we can't settle for something just because it's better than nothing. We must do more. We have to believe that we can do it - and we really are. If we unite and set ourselves a specific goal, the impossible will cease to exist.
25106	21	I'm not ready to give up
25106	23	World leaders admit capitulation to the 1.5°C target. They give up on their promises and our future. I don't know about you, but I know I'm not ready to give up. I will never give up. We will fight for a secure future. Even a fraction of a degree matters, it will always matter.
25106	25	You may say that we are naive to believe that change is possible. All right. But at least we are not naive enough to believe that our problems will be solved by countries and companies setting vague, distant and insufficient targets if they do not face pressure from the media and the public.
25106	27	The gap between what needs to be done and what we actually do is getting bigger by the minute. The gap between the necessary actions and the level of awareness and attention devoted to the problem is becoming more and more absurd. And the gap between so-called climate targets and currently available science should no longer be ignored.
25106	29	These gaps in action, awareness and lack of time are the most obvious problems that are not talked about. Real change will not be possible until we address it. Without specific actions, we will not find a solution.
25106	31	The king is naked - let's stop turning a blind eye to that.
25107	1	"""We kids shouldn't be doing this. But since almost no one is doing anything, we have to"
25107	3	Greta Thunberg - a 16-year-old who fights for the climate, e.g. while on strike in front of the Swedish parliament, she published a Facebook post in which she responded to the allegations against her.
25107	5	Greta also became famous for her speech at the UN climate conference in Katowice, as well as the recent summit in Davos. She became a symbol and inspiration for the youth strike in the streets of Brussels.
25107	7	We encourage you to familiarize yourself with her position, which we have translated into Polish:
25107	9	“Recently, I've seen a lot of rumors about me and a huge amount of hate. This is no surprise to me. I know that since most people are not aware of the full meaning of the climate crisis (which is understandable as it has never been treated as a crisis), a school strike for climate seems very strange to the general public. So let me explain my school strike.
25107	11	In May 2018, I was one of the winners in an environmental text competition organized by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. My article was published and some people contacted me, including Bo Thorén of Fossil Free Dalsland. He had a group of people, mostly young people, who wanted to do something about the climate crisis. I had several conference calls with other activists. The aim was to present ideas for new projects that will draw attention to the climate crisis. Because he had some ideas for things we could do, from marches to the loose idea of ​​some kind of school strike (school kids would do something on school playgrounds or in classrooms). We were inspired by Parkland students who refused to go to school after school shootings.
25107	13	I liked the idea of ​​a school strike. So I developed this idea and tried to get other young people to join me, but no one was really interested. They thought the Swedish version of the Zero Hour march would have a bigger impact. That's why I planned a school strike myself, and then I didn't take part in any meetings.
25107	15	When I told my parents about my plans, they didn't like it very much. They did not support the idea of ​​a school strike and said that if I did, I would have to act alone and without any support.
25107	17	On August 20, I sat in front of the Swedish Parliament. I distributed flyers with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explanations of why I am on strike. The first thing I did was post on Twitter and Instagram what I was doing, and it soon went viral.
25107	19	Later, journalists and newspapers began to arrive. One of the first was the Swedish entrepreneur working in the climate movement, Ingmar Rentzhog. He talked to me and took pictures which he posted on Facebook. It was the first time I met or talked to him. I had never spoken to him before or met him.
25107	21	"Many people love to spread rumors that I have people ""following me"" or am ""paid"" or ""used"" to do what I do. But there is no one ""behind"" me - except myself. My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I made them aware of the situation."
25107	23	I am not part of any organization. Sometimes I support and cooperate with several NGOs working for the climate and the environment. But I am absolutely independent and represent only myself. And I do what I do completely free - I have not received any money or any promise of future payments in any form. No one is related to me or my family. And of course it will stay that way. I have not met a single climate activist who would fight for the climate for money. This idea is completely absurd. Also, I only travel with permission from my school and my parents pay for tickets and accommodation.
25107	25	"My family wrote a book together about our family and how me and my sister Beata influenced the way our parents thought and saw the world, especially when it comes to climate. And about our diagnoses. This book was supposed to be released in May, but due to serious disagreements with the publishing company, we ended up changing the publisher. That's why the book came out in August. Before the book was published, the parents declared that any profits from the book ""Scener ur hjärtat"" (""Scenes from the heart"") will be donated to 8 different charities - dealing with the environment, children with diagnoses and animal rights."
25107	27	Yes, I write my own speeches. But because I know that what I say will reach many people, I often ask many people for support. I also have a few scientists whom I often ask for help in expressing some complicated things. I want everything to be absolutely correct so as not to spread incorrect facts or things that could be misunderstood.
25107	29	"Some people make fun of me because of my diagnosis. But Asperger's is not a disease, it's a gift. People also say that because I have Asperger's, I can't put myself in that position. But that's why I did it. Because if I was ""normal"" and sociable, I would organize myself in an organization or start an organization myself. But since I'm not that good with people, I did that instead."
25107	31	I was very frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis and I felt like I had to do something, anything. And sometimes doing NOTHING - like sitting in front of parliament - speaks louder than doing something. Like a whisper sometimes it's louder than a scream.
25107	33	"There is also an accusation that ""I sound and write like an adult"". All I can say is: Don't you think a 16-year-old can speak for herself? There are also people who say that I simplify things. For example, when I say that ""the climate crisis is a black and white issue"", ""we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""I want panic"". But I'm only saying that because it's true. The climate crisis is the most complex issue we have encountered. It takes a total effort on our part to stop it."
25107	35	But the solution is black and white – we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Because either we limit warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels or we don't. Either we reach a tipping point where we start a chain reaction - with events that are beyond human control - or we don't. Either we survive as a civilization or we don't. There is nothing in between when it comes to survival.
25107	37	And when I say I want panic, what I mean is that we have to treat a crisis as a crisis. When your house is on fire, don't sit down and talk about how easy it is to rebuild it when you put out the fire. If your house is on fire, run outside and make sure everyone is out when you call the fire department. This requires a certain level of panic.
25107	39	"There's one more argument I can't do anything about. It is the fact that I am ""just a child and we should not listen to children"". But that's easy to fix - just start listening to the solid science. Because if everyone listened to the scientists and the facts that I constantly refer to - no one would have to listen to me or any of the hundreds of thousands of school children who are on strike for the climate around the world. Then we could go back to school."
25107	41	I'm just a messenger and yet I receive all this hate. I'm not saying anything new - I'm just saying what scientists have been saying for decades. And I agree with you - I'm too young to do that. We kids shouldn't be doing this. But since almost no one is doing anything and our future is at stake, we feel we must carry on.
25107	43	And if you have other concerns or doubts about me, you can listen to my TED talk (https://www.ted.com/…/greta_thunberg_the_disarming_…/up-next) where I talk about how it started my interest in climate and the environment.
25107	45	And thank you all for your kind support! It gives me hope.
25107	47	"/ Greta"""
25114	1	"EU. Tusk, however, received an ""order for Poland"""
25114	3	"Now, my dear Donald, you will return to your country to defend your values ​​again. … when we meet again we will see you, as you said, as prime minister.” More or less, because I quote from memory, Ursula von der Leyen said goodbye to Donald Tusk when he left his office in Brussels, and more precisely, when he was dismissed from the post of EPP chairman, the last job the EU gave him. It is not without reason that Tusk was reminded that he was returning to the country to defend ""values"", which clearly proves that the EU does not like today's Poland. Tusk had a bad face, because in a sense he was forced to work, which he was never particularly eager to do, but he smiled politely for this phrase he heard, ""dear Donald."" This ""road"" can be understood literally, Tusk's tenure in office cost the EU a lot, but not everything turned out in Poland as the EU wanted it to be.
25114 5 The picture described was shown on 06.07.'22 TVP in the evening news. We had it shown there ""at hand"" that Tusk received an ""order for Poland"" from the EU, that he was sent here to restore liberal rule in our country, democratically or undemocratically, it is irrelevant for the principals. This is yet another proof of what today's EU is like, what ""values"" it prefers, how it understands democracy and how it treats free and independent states. And all this is happening in the light of cameras, in the presence of many prominent EU decision-makers, and clearly shows that democracy and the rule of law are just empty slogans for today's EU decision-makers, which can be interpreted as they see fit. This is not the kind of EU we joined in 2004. No one warned us at that time that the democratically elected government would be overthrown in the street, that high-ranking state officials, inconvenient for the liberals, would be forcibly removed from their offices (presidents of the National Bank of Poland and the Constitutional Tribunal), and such actions are announced by Donald Tusk, already ""anointed"" by Ursula von der Leyen as the future Prime Minister of Poland. And this is said by people who have mouths full of ""rule of law"", ""democracy"" and ordinary human ""honesty"". As you can see, this proper honesty, rule of law and democracy must be sought there with a candle.
25114 7 The aforementioned messages also reminded of the judgments issued by the CJEU, a court that is the last resort for leftist liberals when other methods used to subjugate individual states fail. This allegedly only court authorized to adjudicate what is lawful in the EU and what is not, turns out to be an extremely unfair and extremely biased European court, whose main task is to adjudicate in accordance with the interests of Germany and a small group of EU decision-makers who have admitted to themselves the right to steer the Union in completely different directions than those which guided its founding. There are known facts of meetings of the EU ""elites"" with the judges of the CJEU, which was tracked down by French journalists. And was it different in Poland, during the times of the Constitutional Tribunal of President Rzepliński, when the judges of the Tribunals met with PO activists? It is now that the opposition is attacking the Constitutional Tribunal, relying on reports from eastern hackers who spread, quite likely, fabricated information, and Big Brother from the east is rubbing his hands that he has found more ""useful idiots"" who are causing confusion among Poles.
25114 9 Doesn't the CJEU doctrine remind us of something? Isn't this a kind of so-called ""Neumann doctrine"", which says that Polish ""free courts"" will not touch ""their own"", i.e. PO members and supporters, as long as they are ""their own""? The last ""achievement"" of the CJEU was yesterday's ruling that EU countries are obliged to accept illegal immigrants who, for various reasons, are unable to officially apply for asylum. What does it mean? This means, among others, that according to the CJEU, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are obliged to accept migrants sent to us illegally, recruited for this role by eastern dictators. Even a ""Russian troll"" would not have thought of this, that he could demand the legalization of his actions. Of course, no reasonable state will agree with this ruling/judgment, just as individual states have already disagreed with many judgments of this shady instance that puts itself above all law. It is interesting that only Poland, which does not have the largest number of unexecuted judgments of the CJEU, is imposed by this court on large financial penalties, which I hope our country will never pay. Because this Poland, so ""un-Tuskowa"", does not fit the EU?
25114 11 ""Dear Donald"", one would like to say at the end, go back to Brussels, or to some other Berlin, smoke cigars, work your ass off and stop dealing with politics, because, as your achievements in this field testify, no one from such activities of yours He is not satisfied.
25114 13 PS. To all those who accuse me of manipulation, I refer to yesterday's TVP news from 19:30, they are easy to find, watch this fragment that starts from the 16th minute.
25115 1 Shock! President Duda: ""I am asking you to grit your teeth a bit""
25115 3 On Tuesday, President Duda met with the inhabitants of the Lipski poviat (Mazowieckie Voivodeship). During this meeting, he also referred to the problem of high inflation: ""Unfortunately, not only Polish matters determine what our lives look like, but also external ones have an impact (...). I am asking you to be calm, because we are doing everything to minimize inflationary pressure. I ask you to be of good cheer; to grit your teeth a bit and be optimistic. Nobody expected it to come to us. We did not cause a war in Ukraine, we did not cause a pandemic. Prices are rising and we have no influence on it. We've got to get through it somehow.""
25115 5 Let's note that this ""inflationary pressure"" has been exerted by the government for years. Unfortunately, the PiS government focuses on helping in its own style, i.e. by giving away money. Meanwhile, it is the least effective and costly solution. It is known that in order for the government to give someone PLN 2, it must take PLN 3 from someone else, because there is also the cost of transferring and maintaining the appropriate officials. In addition, one-time or short-term financial assistance is not the same as systemic assistance, and it is a heavy burden on the state budget and causes inflation. The programs 500 plus, 300 plus, 13 and 14 pension, anti-inflationary shields, covid allowances for doctors, and now 300 plus for Ukrainians and 1200 plus are significantly indebted to the Polish state, and their effect is primarily populist.
25115 7 Such a 1200 plus program causes many doubts. Firstly, Poles willingly opened the doors of their apartments and houses to Ukrainians, not counting on anything in return. Now the government is interfering in it, inducing the apparent help of those who want to earn money - so it activates the dodgers. A signal is sent to the West because Poles help, because they get money. In addition, 300 plus for a million Ukrainians is PLN 300 million, and 1200 plus is already 1 billion 200 million. It may turn out that the program will be extended. It is estimated that up to 5 million refugees may arrive in our country, and then these costs will be gigantic. The EU threw us scraps, announcing that it would allocate PLN 500 million to help refugees, which in addition would be distributed among all countries hosting them. The Polish government estimates that this aid may amount to as much as PLN 10 billion, i.e. half of what it costs us 500 plus.
25115 9 You have to help, but you have to do it with your head. PLN 300 at a time is emergency aid, which will not be enough for much, but if it is received by 5 million people, it becomes a gigantic amount of PLN 1.5 billion. In a situation where we are extremely indebted after covid, this type of expenses only kills our budget. It seems that the Polish government is happily indebted to the power, like a gambler who won, felt rich and spends money he did not earn. The thing is that the Polish government has not won any money, and it is already spending not even our money, but our children's. It is worth remembering this and demanding some moderation.
25115 11 This type of money giving away creates inflation. The term ""Putininflation"" is a manipulation, because the war in Ukraine only deepened certain processes. Similarly, the president is right when he says that we had no influence on the emergence of the coronavirus, but he does not add that we already had a decisive influence, or rather those in power, on the introduction of lockdowns that caused gigantic inflation. The call to grit your teeth in this context is impudence similar to the situation where we first cut someone's salary and then call him to save. The problem is that the milk has been spilled and it will be difficult for the government to stop the tsunami it caused. Unfortunately, radical action is needed, such as raising interest rates, and everyone suffers, especially the poorest. Let the president at least not say it's not the government's fault. For this is not true.
25121 1 Success of the Ukrainian army. They destroyed a Russian ammunition depot. Summary of the night
25121 3rd The Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation post of the 785th detachment of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition warehouses and the Fagot anti-tank missile complex, the operational command of ""South"" reported. In turn, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Wereshchuk, almost 800,000 people internally displaced people will need housing, see what else happened last night!"
25121	5	Almost 800,000 Ukrainian citizens lost their homes
25121	7	- Nearly 800,000 Internally displaced people will need housing and everything is being done to provide them with a place to live and spend the winter, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Wereszczuk on Sunday.
25121	9	— As for the need for temporary housing, almost 800 thousand. Ukrainian citizens lost their homes. The government has prepared modular construction programs in this regard, supported by the Ministry of Regions, which has the appropriate funds for their implementation. As you know, these are joint programs with the Polish government, other governments are also involved in them, the first modular cities have already been created, but it is definitely not enough - said Iryna Wereszczuk.
25121	11	"She noted that she witnessed a situation in the Chernihiv region where people did not really want to live in modular cities because they had previously lived in their own private buildings. They said, we want ""at least one room, but in your garden"". ""But it can't be guaranteed yet,"" said Wereszczuk."
25121	13	Mayor Słowiańska: there will be no heating season in the city
25121	15	The mayor of Słowiańska, Wadym Lach, announced on Sunday that due to the war, it would not be possible to start the heating season in the city with the onset of cold weather.
25121	17	"""Currently, there is no water or gas in Sloviansk, and electricity is supplied intermittently due to the proximity of high-voltage power lines to the war zone,"" Vadym Lakh, the mayor of the city, told Donbass News. He added that in such conditions, it will not be possible to start the heating season with the onset of cold weather."
25121	19	He stressed that the inhabitants of Słowiańsk should evacuate, as the attempts to capture the city by the Russian army will continue.
25121	21	The Armed Forces destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an observation post
25121	23	"The Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation post of the 785th detachment of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition depots and the ""Fagot"" anti-tank missile complex, Ukrainian Pravda reported on Monday on the basis of a report from the ""South"" operational command."
25121	25	"According to Monday's report from the ""South"" command, 66 Russians, five tanks, two Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers, three armored vehicles and nine cars were liquidated."
25121	27	The Armed Forces also destroyed the Merlin-VR drone near Ivanovka, where the Russians were trying to carry out aerial reconnaissance.
25121	29	"The Ukrainian air force made five strikes on enemy positions. In particular, 3 enemy positions in the Berysław district were attacked. Pairs of Mi-8 and Mi-24 fighters destroyed 2 enemy positions in the Kherson region, reports OK ""South""."
25127	1	ORDO IURIS TERRORISTS
25127	3	"The biggest hit of the 2020s is ""hybrid warfare"". The hybrid war against Poland is waged by Putin, Lukashenka, but also by Brussels. We hear about hybrid war almost every day, the fashion for hybrid war dominated our politics. And I wanted to speak up about old-school terrorism."
25127	5	"According to the European Commission, terrorism is ""any deliberate act committed by individuals or organizations against states, their institutions or populations with the aim of intimidation"". The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adds that it is an action motivated by ""extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism or irrational and subjective factors, aimed at creating a climate of terror among public figures, specific individuals or groups in society or society as a whole."""
25127	7	"In accordance with these definitions, I request that the Pro-Prawo do Życia Foundation and the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture, as well as Kai Godek, be included in the EU list of persons, groups and entities that are subject to sanctions due to their participation in terrorist acts. That's a start, although there should be room for a few other ""pro-lifers"" on the list as well. Whose action is undoubtedly focused on ""intimidation"", as well as ""creating a climate of terror"" among ""a specific group"" - medics, especially those related to gynecology and obstetrics, but not only - and is undoubtedly motivated by ""extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism and irrational subjective factors. And also - although this condition is no longer in the definition - it causes the death of innocent people."
25127	9	"For the record: no one who is not a spiritual brother of Kai Godek has any doubts that the high-profile death of a pregnant woman in a hospital in Pszczyna is a direct result of the decision of the Przyłębska tribunal on the ban on ""eugenic abortion"". There is no room for interpretation here: the fetus had congenital defects, additionally there was oligohydramnios - that is, it was damaged - before it could be removed, now it is not; if it had been removed in time, the woman would most likely be alive. And so she died. So much."
25127	11	But in the context of terrorism, the second aspect is more important - abortion to save a woman's health and life. Theoretically still acceptable. According to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, three hundred legal abortions were performed in Poland after the Przyłębska tribunal's verdict was announced - that is, abortions to save the mother's life and health. That's 15 times more than before. Which means that there are brave doctors in Poland who put the well-being of their patients above their comfort and safety. Nevertheless, as the opponents of tightening the anti-abortion law repeat over and over again, the state has no right to demand heroism from its citizens. Nor from women who are forced to make terrible sacrifices for the fetus; nor from doctors who, by deciding to terminate a pregnancy, risk their professional future and perhaps their freedom today. And here we enter the area of ​​intimidation.
25127	13	As rightly noted by Prof. Marzena Dębska, gynecologist, you never know who will be the author of the expert opinion in a possible disciplinary or criminal case related to termination of pregnancy to save a woman's life. And medicine differs from mathematics in that the same numbers - e.g. the CPR indicator informing about inflammation - can be interpreted differently. As already seriously life-threatening - that is, justifying treatment by fetal abortion - or not yet at all. No one doubts that if Ziobro's prosecutor's office decided to conduct a show trial of a doctor accused of unlawful termination of pregnancy, it would find experts like Prof. Chazan, famous for forcing women to give birth to babies without heads. Prof. Mariusz Zimmer, president of the Polish Society of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, points out that among people graduating from medicine, there are no candidates for this otherwise very lucrative specialization. Too much of a risk. In a word: doctors are intimidated.
25127	15	"The line of attack of integrists towards cases such as those from Pszczyna can be clearly seen in the statement of attorney Magdalena Majkowska from Ordo Iuris, who, knowing the case only from the media, did not fail to go to television and announce that the drama was the result of medical malpractice. Because ""doctors are not afraid to terminate a pregnancy to save the mother's life and health"", so if one of them does not terminate when necessary, it is his fault. Let him be afraid."
25127	17	"However, it is difficult to find an act of intimidation more spectacular than the civic initiative submitted by the Pro - Right to Life Foundation and written by Ordo Iuris, hiding under the enigmatic name ""amending the Criminal Code Act and some other acts"". This is the famous project that abolishes the anti-abortion law and equates abortion with murder. The rapporteur of the project is Mariusz Dzierżawski, and his deputy Łukasz Jończyk - and they should also be included in the list of terrorists, because the mere submission of such a project is unquestionably oriented towards creating a climate of terror."
25128	1	FUCK OUT, BUT WHERE?
25128	3	"Among the many banners present at the anti-PiS protests, one in particular caught the eye - with a concise slogan: ""Get the fuck out!"". However, this issue is more complicated than it may seem – and requires clarification. Fuck off, but who? Kaczynski himself? The whole PiS? With or without youth? And Solidarna Polska, Gowin's sofa and the Confederation can stay?"
25128	5	Another, perhaps even more difficult, issue is where to get the fuck out. Mass emigration, especially in the era of COVIDU, seems difficult to meet. According to party data, PiS currently has over 40,000 members - this number has increased by half during the previous term alone. So where to send these people? And who would want them?
25128	7	"It's easy to shout ""Get the fuck out!"", but what then, no one thinks about it anymore. In order to check whether this beautiful political slogan translates into practice, I decided to analyze the exports of only one person from Poland: the president of PiS. He enjoys such authority on the right that if he leaves alone, the rest will inevitably follow him."
25128	10	1. Russia
25128	12	"I have read all the biographies of the deputy prime minister available on the market and a sad picture emerges from them. Jarosław went abroad only once – as an 18-year-old on the Black Sea in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, even with this trip he was not satisfied. In the interview-rival ""About two such ... Alphabet of the Kaczyński brothers"" Kaczyński recalls the hot summer holidays: ""Supplies at a catastrophic level. A few years earlier, they ate bread with sawdust (...) After returning to Poland, we had the impression that we were returning to the zone of freedom and wealth.'"
25128	14	Some time has passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia has become a prized retirement home for fallen warlords. For example, Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian ex-president, is retiring there, sentenced in absentia to 13 years in prison in his homeland.
25128	16	Unfortunately, relations between Putin and Kaczyński are not the best. When Jarosław was prime minister in 2006-2007, the gentlemen never met. In 2010, as is known, Putin murdered Kaczyński's brother, who was going to Russia on a guest visit. This is not the best land for cohabitation. Although it is worth adding that on the upper Volga there is already the city of Yaroslavl, with over 600,000 inhabitants, named after another wise Yaroslav - Prince Yaroslav the Wise.
25128	18	Kaczyński's nature is also such that he would immediately start to work with Putin, and although it is a great country, one dictator has been enough for him for years. Even if Kaczyński managed to provoke another revolution in Russia, which was already favorable to Poland in regaining independence, it does not seem realistic that this man mentally close to the Bolsheviks would be able to get on a horse and reach the border.
25128	20	"Another, no less important barrier is language. The president is not ""panimajet, are you gavarish"". If we add to this the fact that the PiS elite might feel some historically justified anxiety before traveling deep into this heavily forested country, it becomes clear that Jarosław may go to Russia not to emigrate, but at most for tea."
25128	24	2. England
25128	26	"The most popular emigration destination among Poles. It would suit Kaczyński, if only in this respect, that he could try to create another government-in-exile in history and through it issue decrees, award orders and pretend to exercise real power. The president, however, had been to the Thames before and, to put it mildly, did not like it. In November 1989, the authorities of the Civic Parliamentary Club ordered him to go to London to mobilize English politicians and the local Polish community in the matter of recognizing the Polish-German border. In the book ""Agreement against monopoly"", the president recalls: ""I had problems with passport control at the airport. Despite my diplomatic passport, I was asked what I wanted to do and where to live. I struggled to answer something (…). I returned to Poland with some relief."
25128	28	A year later, Kaczyński made another flight to England - this time, however, he did not even leave the airport. He immediately went to Warsaw on the return plane with Ryszard Kaczorowski, who decided to return the insignia of the head of state of the Second Polish Republic.
25128	30	"It took 20 years for the next visit to the queen's country. In June 2010, as PiS's presidential candidate, Kaczyński paid a visit to Prime Minister David Cameron. The cameras captured the British man's polite greeting and Kaczynski's reaction: the words ""aj dont anderstend"", combined with panicky waving of hands and searching for an interpreter."
25128	32	On March 22, 2017, Kaczyński went to London for the last time to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and discuss Brexit. However, because of the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge, he had to stay overnight in London. It's not - you'll admit - a memory you want to come back to.
25128	34	Among the advantages of staying in England, Kaczyński could undoubtedly mention the fact that this country has ceased to belong to the European Union, which imposes its opinion on Poland as regards the rule of law and human rights. In addition, Kaczyński, who failed in high school from class to class with a B in English, he could come across numerous Poles in the UK and open his mouth in the only language he knew. However, there is a risk that among the compatriots there could be people unfavorable to the president - for example pro-abortion activists who protested in large numbers last week in front of the embassy in London. And he would at least end up bruised.
2514	1	Can COVID vaccinations be mandatory? Legal opinion of the HFHR
2514	3	A parliamentary draft bill providing for the introduction of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 is awaiting consideration in the Sejm. “The current epidemic situation may justify extending the obligation of preventive vaccinations to include vaccinations against COVID-19. Such a step would be important for protecting the health of people who cannot be vaccinated, as well as for guaranteeing effective access to healthcare for people who suffer from diseases other than COVID-19.
2514	5	Duty of the authorities
2514	7	In its opinion, the HFHR pointed out that the constitution imposes an obligation on public authorities to combat infectious diseases, although it does not specify in detail how this should be implemented.
2514	9	Mandatory vaccination against specific epidemic diseases may be a way to fulfill this obligation, and this solution has been used by the authorities for at least a dozen or so years. In its opinion, the HFHR reminds that in Poland the vaccination order applies to as many as 14 diseases and so far the constitutionality of such obligations has not been challenged. Importantly, the already functioning act allows for the obligation to include protective vaccinations against coronavirus. The adoption of a separate act on this subject would dispel any doubts regarding the legality of the obligation formulated in this way, guaranteeing its better enforcement.
2514	11	Vaccinations and personal freedom
2514	13	The obligation to vaccinate interferes with an individual's personal freedom and his or her right to respect for private life. However, these rights are not absolute. Under certain conditions and on certain terms, they may be limited.
2514	15	In this regard, the Constitution requires that such restrictions be established only by statute and only when they are necessary in a democratic state to protect specific values. These include the health, rights and freedoms of others, and public order.
2514	17	Strasbourg Court: Mandatory vaccinations do not violate rights
2514	19	The obligation to vaccinate has also recently been the subject of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. In the case of Vavřička and others v. the Czech Republic, he found that compulsory vaccination was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, he outlined a number of circumstances that should be taken into account when assessing whether vaccination against a particular disease should become mandatory.
2514	21	It is worth emphasizing that the Polish government also submitted its opinion on this matter, in which it indicated that the obligation to vaccinate as such does not violate the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.
2514	23	The epidemic situation requires action
2514	25	In the light of the criteria outlined by the ECtHR, it should be recognized that the current epidemic situation may justify extending the obligation of preventive vaccination to include vaccination against COVID-19. “Another, alternative solution to counteract the pandemic could be to introduce further restrictions on the freedom of movement, the right to education, and the freedom to conduct business. At the same time, it would be highly debatable to claim that such measures would be less burdensome than the obligation to undergo preventive vaccinations,” the HFHR notes in its opinion.
25140	1	CANON MEAT IN STOCK
25140	3	The Red Army is apparently green. In fighting. Soldiers fight without conviction and kill only out of habit. The maneuvers of the Russian gang in this war resemble scenes from a comedy about military cunts. And now the Gypsies will support their tank, and now they will fire at their own positions, the tanks are standing because they ran out of fuel, and the soldiers are giving up because they have run out of supplies and have not eaten for three days. The myth of the great Russian army fell like Napoleon at Waterloo.
25140	5	The only successes that Russian troops have been recorded in shelling apartment blocks and killing civilians. It is easy to hit civilians, because there are a lot of them, and the army has no scruples, just like ethical values. Ukraine was supposed to be occupied in three days, meanwhile three weeks pass and the successes are similar to those of Polish athletes at the Chinese Olympics. Oh, there will be no medals for this war.
25140	7	Unfortunately, Putin does not take into account losses at all and will send more soldiers to certain death. A man in Russian war tactics is nothing. “We have a lot of people here,” Stalin is said to have said. During the Second World War, the so-called combat reconnaissance. Troops with the Nazis in front and NKVD platoons in the back were moving towards the fortified German positions. These troops were sent to some slaughter, but it was about discovering German firing positions, which were then bombed.
25140	9	Putin so-called he started the second Chechen war with a provocation. In 1999, in Moscow, Ryazan and Volgodonsk, special services blew up apartment blocks. It happened at night and in the morning. Several hundred sleeping citizens died. Chechen separatists were accused of the attacks, and then it was Putin who famously said that we would catch them and even drown them in the toilet, which appealed to the nation that wanted revenge. Today it is known that Putin's services were behind the attacks, and that the blowing up of the apartments was a provocation to justify the slaughter in Chechnya.
25141	3	It's louder than firing a cannon. It's eloquent and rings in your ears like three alarm clocks at once.
25141	5	When there were black umbrella protests. She was silent. When there were women's protests with hangers. She was silent. When the police beat women during the Women's Strike. She was silent. When nurses and carers of the disabled protested. She was silent.
25141	7	When the police took 15-year-olds to police stations for shouting vulgar words at demonstrations. She was silent. When children from Michałów were taken to swamps and forests. She was silent.
25141	9	I saw a video of her reading fairy tales to children at the royal castle in Warsaw. It suits her. Husband Andrzej also tells fairy tales. And not only in the castle, but all the time. Maybe Agata should read something about women's rights after all?
25141	11	Now, when, as a result of the activities of the lobby of religious fanatics and the decision of the Tribunal by Cook Przyłębska, regulations were introduced on a complete ban on abortion, even in the case of rape or life-threatening, a young girl from Pszczyna dies, she also remains silent.
25141	13	And she could make even a small gesture. After all, he comes from a good Krakow family. Families of sensitive poets. When, on the day of the premiere of the propaganda film Smolensk, she went to see another film, it was perceived almost as a demonstration of independence. But she never was and never will be.
25141	15	Chic clothes and elegance will not cover the lack of class and heart. Cold, calculating, predictable like German grammar exercises.
25141	17	She had the deal of the century in her life. By chance, her husband, a man without a backbone, with the mentality of a junior high school student and the appearance of Mr. Bean, became president, and she became the First Lady.
25141	19	She will not spoil her job when some woman from a small town far from Warsaw, a woman whom she does not know, dies as a result of a stupid law. She will not spoil the comfort of living in the presidential palace while some women suffer, fight for their rights and are beaten.
25141	21	And now it's the second term. No one will take Andrzej off his job. And for the second time, he cannot run for the seat in the Palace. So she could at least sympathize.
25141	23	"There is a saying that you need money and looks to be ""Mr."" All it takes to be a First Lady is to have a heart. As you can see, it was missing."
25143	1	Trouble getting there, or the President's Traveling Circus
25143	3	Anyone who has ever had a new car knows that for the first few thousand kilometers you must not saw the car and press the accelerator pedal. The new car has to arrive.
25143	5	Jarosław Kaczyński is not a newbie in politics, but rather a sharply beaten rattler. And yet, he has access problems.
25143	7	Poles have problems with reaching Jaroslaw, who are hindered from entering his supposedly open meetings. The accelerator pedal in this case is pressed hard by the police, who chase away all citizens who want to tell the President what they think about him.
25143	9	Recently, in Kórnik, at a meeting with the local community, only previously marked individuals brought in by coaches were allowed, while the locals were blocked by reinforced police forces.
25143	11	Reaching Jarosław was like forcing a fortified castle. Police cars and armed to the teeth policemen protecting the nation's savior is a sight to which everyone has already become accustomed. A certain novelty were the mounted police units that practiced police rodeo, scaring those who wanted to meet Jarosław.
25143	13	Security specialists say that if the temperature of the President's Traveling Circus increases at the same pace as recently, neither horse patrols nor cavalry charges with police cars will be enough. We will have to strengthen the protection with combat vehicles, tanks, and perhaps rocket launchers. Military experts say that trenches and barbed wire fences will have to be built for the next meetings of the President. Anti-personnel mines can also come in handy.
25143	15	A large amount of equipment has recently been purchased in connection with the war in Ukraine, so this will not be a problem. The only question is whether it is not cheaper to hold meetings with the local community in the offices on Nowogrodzka Street, since the roles of locals are played by hired actors and extras anyway? Each time, only send a TVP crew that, masked and with mustaches, will film a few pictures from a given town and such material will be added to a beautiful report from local visits to Jarozbawa.
25148	1	Silver for Sunday (because silence is golden)
25148	3	Uncompromising Simon
25148	5	The uncompromising Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Polska2050, has always criticized the rule of the United Right. He also wrote negatively about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, it turned out that the Dobra Fabryka foundation founded by him in 2020 received PLN 680,000 in subsidies from the same ministry. He probably took it with disgust, but he took it anyway. One thing I'm curious about though: what did he get them for? Maybe for an equally critical attitude towards the Civic Platform and its presidential candidate?
25148	7	The successes of the Polish Order
25148	9	"Politicians from the United Right promised Polish teachers a noticeable increase in earnings, while at the beginning of January, educators rubbed their eyes in amazement at the amounts that had been credited to their accounts. It turned out that their salaries are several hundred zlotys lower than in December. One day, the Minister of Education and Science, Przemysław Czarnek, accused the journalist of lying in connection with questions about lower teachers' salaries after the introduction of the Polish Deal. He argued that it was ""certainly not because of the Polish Order, but because of other reasons."" The next day, however, government spokesman Piotr Mueller admitted that lower wages had been paid and apologized for ""legislative inaccuracies"". In the end, even the prime minister apologized for the mistakes and promised to fix them with a new regulation. The problem is that, as lawyers unanimously claim, laws cannot be changed by ordinances. But who would care about such trifles when repairing this flagship work, after all, in our beautiful country the law means little, unless it is paired with justice..."
25148	11	Once is not enough!
25148	13	Even before the New Year, the Kraśnik bypass was opened for the first time. It took place with the modest assistance of local government officials from PiS, public television and with the participation of Jarosław Trzecirski (PiS), the marshal of the Lubelskie Voivodeship. But once is not enough! A few days later, the traffic on the already completed road was stopped and the ceremonial ribbon-cutting took place again. This time with the participation of Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin and ministers of: infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk, funds and regional policy Grzegorz Puda, education and science Przemysław Czarnek and deputy finance minister Piotr Patkowski. Almost 60 people were invited to the second, much grander opening, including the same local government officials as last week. I wonder if they didn't have déjà vu during that second party...
25148	15	Dura lex, sed lex
25148	17	Do you remember how during the protests of the Women's Strike in connection with the tightening of the anti-abortion law, a certain nineteen-year-old police officer broke her arm? The girl filed a lawsuit against the police. Well, recently, after a year of consideration, this case ended in discontinuation. Meanwhile, the suspect of painting anti-government and anti-church slogans on the façade of St. Krzyża was placed in pre-trial detention for three months at the request of the prosecutor's office. However, Polish criminal law is a real jungle, full of secrets and surprises, because according to it, it turned out that writing with a spray on a wall is more dangerous for society than violence and bodily harm.
25154	1	Kraska: we have 599 new infections. The number of infections is falling
25154	3	"The number of coronavirus infections in Poland is decreasing week by week. Last Monday, there were 618 new cases. Today, according to the words of Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraska, COVID-19 was confirmed in 599. ""This is, if we compare week to week, a decrease of 2 percent, which is less week to week"" — summed up the politician in an interview with TVP."
25154	5	Infections are reduced by 2% week to week.
25154	7	The Ministry of Health publishes data on new infections or deaths in connection with COVID-19 every day. They are published at 10.30. On August 8, however, we learned the latest data in advance. Information about the infections on Monday morning was provided by Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraska.
25154	9	– Today it is 599 cases [COVID-19], which is, if we compare week to week, a decrease of 2 percent, which is less week to week. These are small numbers, because these are the numbers from the weekend, but if we look at the statistics and also the surroundings of our country, i.e. Western European countries, but also the Czech Republic, Slovakia, we see a downward wave everywhere, i.e. this summer wave of coronavirus is definitely weaker - said Waldemar Kraska on TVP.
25154	11	Epidemic situation in Poland — data from August 7
25154	13	The day before, on August 7, 2022, the Ministry of Health reported 698 new coronavirus infections. Most cases were recorded in the province Mazowieckie (105), Śląskie (78) and Lesser Poland (61). Seven people infected with COVID-19 have recovered. No deaths were recorded on that day.
25162	1	The Chinese military continues exercises around Taiwan
25162	3	The Chinese military continues to conduct exercises in the seas and airspace around Taiwan on Monday, the eastern theater command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) announced on social media.
25162	5	"The army will conduct ""practical exercises in sea and air space"". Chinese soldiers to train in attacking submarines, said in a statement posted on the Weibo platform."
25162	7	China has been conducting unprecedented military exercises in the waters and airspace surrounding Taiwan since Thursday. Some of the maneuvers take place just 20 km from the Taiwanese coast. The maneuvers are in response to the recent visit of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Taipei, against which Beijing strongly protested. Initially, it was reported that the exercises would end on Sunday.
25167	1	The Great Barrier Reef is great in more than name. She just stood up to climate change
25167	3	Is it possible nowadays to write something optimistic and positive about climate change and the coral reef? Counter-intuitively, it turns out to be. This is really surprisingly good news
25167	5	"According to scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, the Great Barrier Reef is currently the largest in almost 40 years. Such a ""rebirth"", which covers as much as 2/3 of the Great Barrier Reef's surface, probably no one expected."
25167	7	It is well known that climate change, the constant heating of ocean waters expose corals sensitive to temperature and sunlight to really difficult conditions for development. Increasingly frequent heat waves, and thus increases in sea temperature, cause the so-called the bleaching of the coral reef, leading to the gradual death of this fascinating ecosystem.
25167	9	The coral reef is slowly recovering
25167	11	All the more surprising is the process described by scientists in the report taking place in the northern and central regions of the Great Barrier Reef. It seems that the corals decided to fight for survival. Oceanographers have not seen such an intensive reconstruction process for decades.
25167	13	Considering that the process of warming the atmosphere is progressing at an accelerating pace, it is especially pleasing that the bleaching of the coral reef in 2020 and 2022 is not as intense as it was 5-6 years ago. This, in turn, means that the corals are better able to cope with the conditions in the ocean and are able to rebuild themselves.
25167	15	Of course, we are talking here about a big step in the right direction, but there is still a long way to full success. Researchers indicate that in the central part of the Great Barrier Reef, live corals reached 33 percent, and in the northern region as much as 36 percent. It may not seem like much, but it is already an increase that restores hope that corals can recover and come back to life. If this trend continues in the coming years, and the episodes of reef bleaching become a little less frequent, perhaps the magnificent coral reef, which is one of the most unique marine ecosystems on Earth, can return to its full glory and save thousands of species from extinction. rely.
25171	1	"in ""Wiadomości"" TVP! How Tusk and the Germans ""invented mercury"""
25171	3	One thing we can be sure of: as long as PiS is in power, nothing can be explained in a definitive and credible way. We will hear the story that will do the least damage to the government.
25171	5	"The main editions of TVP's ""Wiadomości"" on Monday and Tuesday (August 15-16) had a clear message about the ecological disaster on the Oder River: the situation is under control, and the ""total opposition"" inspired by Germany is lying about mercury in the river. Tusk's metaphors about the ""dormant state of PiS"" and ""PiS, which is like mercury"", are empty slander against the authorities, who cannot be accused of anything in the case of the Oder River."
25171	7	"""Wiadomości"" from August 15 was a solemn and religious occasional program (Polish Army Day). learn from Danuta Holecka herself that the Mother of God appeared to Russian soldiers twice, defending them from entering Warsaw. This vision caused panic in the Bolshevik ranks. In addition, on the occasion of the Christmas concert in Elbląg, the digging of the Vistula Spit was praised to the skies - not only as an investment in Poland's independence, but also as a great economic venture. Journalists of public television have no doubts - even on the latter issue."
25171	9	TVP. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride
25171	11	"It is very difficult to find yourself in this characteristic infantile-militaristic aesthetics and rhetoric for someone who has not been brought up on the Russian-Asian models of public life. Older Poles remember it from the People's Republic of Poland and probably some people like it. You know, youth. And those who do not remember the People's Republic of Poland may associate the style of Jacek Kurski's television with China or other countries of the East. Some of this comes to us through movies and movies. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride... But do we really have to go to Asia? Does Jacek Kurski, producing his ""Wiadomości"" for President Kaczyński, see him as little Xi Jinping? By the way, an interesting clue: Jarosław Kaczyński's Asian features. I throw the ball - let the sinologists catch it."
25171	13	In any case, the psychological profile of the president of Poland in the eyes of the president of TVP will remain a secret of the latter, although Mr. Kurski must be admired for professionalism in the craft of propaganda and great dedication to the work of staying on a stool, from which several other gentlemen would gladly push him.
25171	15	But let's go back to the Oder. The message from Tuesday, August 16, was much more extensive. A lot of specific information was given, which we also know from other media. How many water samples were taken, what could have happened (as we know, it is not known yet), how many dead fish were caught. First of all, it was reported (apparently true) that the situation was improving.
25171	17	"There was also mention of restocking the Oder, for which (as Prime Minister Morawiecki assured on Tuesday) there will be funds. In general, according to the ""Wiadomości"" material, nothing that big happened, and the cause of the disaster - although not fully known - is probably related to the low water level, which, after all, causes various ecological problems not only in Poland. I would like to add here that in the flood of journalistic materials about the Oder disaster, very little is said about how this water level actually developed. It seems he wasn't that low again. There is also almost no mention of retention reservoirs and sluices, i.e. whether the possibilities of dilution of the Oder waters were used. This topic will probably come back again."
25171	19	Tusk compares PiS to mercury
25171	21	"Meanwhile, we watch Tuesday's ""News"". Immediately after the material about the Oder, maintained in a rather matter-of-fact tone, there was a real outburst of hate against Donald Tusk. Here the ""total opposition"" uses the misfortune of the ecological catastrophe for a dirty political war, which it wages hand in hand with Germany. The weapon in this war was disinformation about the alleged presence of mercury in the Oder, which is not confirmed. PO floods the country with an ""avalanche of lies"", and it's in his blood. Suffice it to recall that Prime Minister Kopacz said that she had no money for any 500 plus, and at the same time Tusk announced that he would introduce a similar program. As you can see, he's a cheater. He once raised the retirement age, and now he wants a four-day workday..."
25171	23	"Although I can't keep up with the four-day workday myself, but when it comes to PiS as a dead fish and comparing it to mercury, these epithets don't seem very exuberant - regardless of how many mercury compounds are finally detected or not detected. The insinuation that the PO and the Germans ""invented mercury"" is absurd. The news about mercury appeared in the German media, and at the same time, the Marshal of the Lubuskie Province, Elżbieta Polak, heard about it from Alex Vogel, the Minister of the Environment of Brandenburg. Probably some mercury compound was detected somewhere, but this was not confirmed in subsequent samples. Tusk used the comparison of PiS with mercury when the ""mercury hypothesis"" was still relevant. The hypothesis has already passed into history, but the metaphor has not lost its relevance - and for many reasons."
25171	25	"The opposition does not accuse the authorities of allowing one or another chemical compound to be found in the Oder River (perhaps the time will come for such accusations as well), but that it did not react on time. And that's the key thing. This is what the game is about and this is where the government's PR strategy focuses. This is shown by the press conferences of dignitaries, which took place on Tuesday, August 16. After a very professional and detailed message from the ministers of the environment and infrastructure, journalists began to ask about the date of intervention by the central institutions. Questions remained unanswered, and the conference official unceremoniously ""quenched"" them. It was obvious that the subject of the delay was reserved for the ""top"" itself (because the Prime Minister spoke about it when dismissing two high officials), while ministers Moscow and Adamczyk were not to comment on this extremely sensitive matter."
25171	27	PiS is moving forward
25171	29	The ostentatious refusal to answer is a fatal strategy. However, literally hour by hour, a fundamental change took place in her. At the conference of the Lower Silesian Voivode, Jarosław Obrębski (PiS) and his deputy, numerous details regarding the chronology of events were presented. The explanation for the several-day delay in decisive action in Lower Silesia, given by the local PiS authorities, was that after the first signals about numerous dead fish, the situation improved, and only after a few days its radical deterioration. Thus, the reactions of the authorities were proportionate and corresponded to the development of the situation. This is an announcement of a new PiS narrative. Yes, there were delays, but they were justified by the dynamics of the course of the disaster.
25173	3	"Pro-government media and PiS politicians considered yesterday's statement by the German minister as proof of the ""lies"" of Marshal Elżbieta Polak about the presence of mercury in the Oder river. Throughout Monday, propaganda distracted attention from the slow reaction of the Polish government to the contamination of the river"
25173	5	At the end of the day on Monday, it turned out that German measurements did indeed show mercury in the water, but it was not taken from the main stream of the river and it is already known that it is not responsible for the death of fish. Still, three weeks after the first signals about the Odra catastrophe, it is not known what is killing the river.
25173	7	However, August 15 was the day of mercury and Prime Minister Morawiecki could accuse Donald Tusk of fake news at a press conference on the Oder River.
25173	9	Root lost in translation
25173	11	The information that mercury salt can kill Odra appeared at the end of the week. It was repeated by PO activists, referring to the first German analyses.
25173	13	"Marshal Elżbieta Polak tweeted a photo from a videoconference with the German minister and wrote that the latter ""in a direct conversation"" admitted that ""the concentration of mercury in the Oder River was so high that it was impossible to determine the scale."" Thus, she confirmed the reports of the German radio and television RBB, which was the first to publicly announce information about mercury in the river."
25173	15	The mercury scandal started on Sunday for good, because the government propaganda made it the main problem of the Odra River and argued that it was false information spread by the opposition. It began after joint Polish-German consultations and a press conference on the situation on the Oder River on Sunday, August 14, 2022. It was to be the beginning of a new, better cooperation of both countries to determine the causes of the ecological disaster. Instead, we brushed against a diplomatic scandal.
25173	17	A TVP journalist asked the German delegation whether mercury was actually found in the samples from the river, according to Marshal Polak.
25173	19	"“The Marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship tweeted on Friday that you had personally confirmed to her that the concentration of mercury in the Oder River was so high that it was impossible to determine the scale. I wanted to ask you if you said such words, on what basis and why” – that was the question. But, as we wrote in OKO.press, the Polish translator who forwarded the question to Axel Vogel, Minister of Agriculture and Environment of the German state of Brandenburg, asked him if Marshal Pole said that the Oder River was ""caustic"". He missed the mercury issue."
25173	21	"Vogel replied that ""such a statement is not known to him."" ""We have reported that the pH is very high and we cannot explain why this is the case,"" he added."
25173	23	But although the question was mistranslated, the Polish pro-government media believed that the minister denied it. And they started a campaign against Elżbieta Polak.
25173	25	Sharp words for quotes were provided by PiS politicians on Twitter.
25173	27	“After this statement by the German minister, it is reasonable to suspect that Elżbieta Polak misinformed the public about the situation on the Oder in a crisis situation. In my opinion, this should be clarified by the relevant services,” wrote Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Paweł Szefernaker on Sunday evening.
25173	29	"""Well, it's quite a scandal. So the marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship invented mercury? Maybe to divert attention from the problems in her WORD?” – Maciej Wąsik, also the deputy head of the Ministry of Interior and Administration, echoed him."
25173	31	“The case is obvious. The official position of Germany is known,” commented the Deputy Minister of Climate and Environment, Jacek Dekora.
25173	33	"""Marshal of the Lubuski »disinformed the public« about mercury?” – this question appeared on the main page of the TVP.info portal on Monday noon. Similar titles appeared on the portals wPolityce.pl and Polska Times."
25173	35	Germans amazed
25173	37	"“This is outrageous! I was asked by the interpreter about the alleged quote from me that the water in the Oder can burn your hands. I responded to this and explained the pH values. I wasn't asked about mercury levels,"" Vogel tweeted this morning."
25173	39	He attached the screenshots shared by one of the Twitter users to the post, showing how the pro-government Polish media uses Vogel's statement to deny the alleged fake news of Marshal Pole.
25173	41	As it turned out, the German minister did not hear the question about mercury at the conference, so he could not deny anything.
25173	43	"However, the pro-government media managed to redirect attention to this kind of ""success"" of the authorities - the lack of mercury in the river. Thousands of dead fish, the contamination of the Oder River and the government's sluggishness in reacting to the ecological catastrophe have faded into the background."
25173	45	The mercury was there, but it's not what kills
25173	47	We still don't know what killed thousands of fish in the Oder. Polish and German studies so far indicate high water salinity, increased - alkaline - pH and increased oxygen concentration.
25173	49	"The e-mail sent to OKO.press from the Ministry of the Environment of Brandenburg showed that the level of mercury is still being checked. In this context, Saturday's announcement by climate minister Anna Moscow, in which she assures that Germany has not found the presence of mercury in water, seemed premature (At the press conference on Sunday, the minister informed that Poland was ""carrying out work on identifying the source"")."
25173	51	"“To date, none of the studies have confirmed the presence of toxic substances. We also conduct fish research. We have completed testing for mercury and heavy metals - they were not found in the samples. In the near future, we will check another 300 indicators,"" Moscow said on Sunday."
25173	53	On Monday afternoon, the German authorities summed up the meeting with the Polish side.
25173	55	Minister Axel Vogel confirmed that he had warned Elżbieta Polak that a high concentration of mercury was detected in the first sample examined by the Germans. In a conversation with the marshal, however, he was to add that the sample could be an anomaly and the tests should be repeated.
25173	57	Subsequent samples were to give results within or slightly above environmental tolerance.
25173	59	Vogel said he didn't think mercury was the cause of the fish dying. Because this element accumulates in living organisms for a long time.
25173	61	"""We're wandering in the dark, we're researching insecticides, pesticides, all kinds of substances,"" Vogel admitted."
25173	63	"In the evening, German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke said that while research is still ongoing and it is still unknown what poisoned the river, ""mercury does not appear to be the cause of fish mortality"". Lemke's spokesman, Urlich Schulte, told Polsat News that ""mercury has not been detected either in the dead fish or in the water itself. So today we can rule that out."""
25173	65	On the other hand, the Polish Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection admitted that German samples taken in oxbow lakes of the Oder River and its tributaries contained mercury. On the other hand, Polish research in the main stream of the river did not show mercury, and the State Veterinary Inspection ruled out mercury as the cause of fish death.
25173	67	dead fish in the Gliwice canal
25173	69	Min. Vogel also emphasized that the German side should have received information about the contamination of the Oder River near Wrocław on July 28. “But that didn't happen. We were surprised,” he lamented.
25173	71	“The first fish kills in Brandenburg were spotted on August 9. We had no warning from Poland,” spokesman Schulte said. And it was two weeks after the information about contamination of the Oder appeared in Poland. Earlier, anglers reported dead fish in the Gliwice Canal.
25176	1	Pisowska eco-omert
25176	3	They are going in denial about the Odra. The opposition is rightly pressing for details. It's a whole avalanche of questions. On the parliamentary committee and in the media. If they answered honestly, as it was, there would be a chance for the cooperation of political forces. But they didn't read Bartoszewski or Kotarbiński that it's worth being decent, and if you don't know what to say, you tell the truth. They clearly don't know what to say, and they don't want to tell the truth. So the old way: instead of explaining, they attack those who want explanations.
25176	5	There is no information vacuum in the age of the internet. If they are not telling the truth, the void is filled with speculation. So there is information about who poisoned the Oder. I'm not repeating because it's not verified. On Wednesday, however, a key question was asked at the commission: do you want to hide the perpetrator and the reasons for the Oder conspiracy of silence in Kaczyński's camp? If that were the case, the current government's evasions would gain coherence: they know, but they have a huge problem, so they lie and swindle, stall, look for catchy substitute topics.
25176	7	Whatever the final findings will be - poisoning crime or natural causes, i.e. force majeure - the Odra case also has two positives. Firstly, citizens can see the condition of the state financed from their taxes under Kaczyński's rule. Secondly, many Poles will open their eyes to the truth that nature must be taken care of, because it will not defend itself against the predatory exploitation of its resources under the cover of bad governance.
25176	9	"Misrule mocks ""environmentalism"" as well as other alleged ""leftist"" ideologies. That is why Kaczyński ignored the Oder disaster during a trip to Ruda Śląska. He was silent, because maybe he knew the truth about her from the beginning. But also so as not to give the PiS concrete the impression that the opposition's questions deserve an answer at all. On the contrary: we want to know what the Polish Waters are for, why there is no constant monitoring of rivers, what is the government's idea to save the Oder River and to ensure Poland's water security."
25176	11	The tactics adopted by Kaczyński's camp - a mixture of arrogance with manipulation and information rationing - will fail anyway. Because sooner or later the answers will be known. If it turns out that it was about hiding the truth, voters, even PiS voters, will not let go of the topic.
25176	13	Hooting that asking questions is unpatriotic is a caricature of constructive parliamentary work. Members of Parliament are patriotic when they ask specific questions to those in power. It is unpatriotic to avoid them as the ecological clock ticks louder and louder.
25176	15	Part two. Golden algae
25176	17	Finally, they came up with: it's golden algae, not KGHM with the permission of Wody Polskie, or some other large state-owned company. A natural disaster, as in other European rivers. Back off, Tusk.
25176	19	"Only these salts, what about them? Where did they suddenly come from, and golden algae are fattening on them? Anyway, it's not their fault, it's the ""political chutzpah"" of the opposition. And the problem is over, because PiS writhes and whines until his PR supporters give him something. When he has a message they consider credible, the nerves calm down."
25176	21	"Early. There are the first polls already from the inside of the Odrzan turmoil. Nearly 70 percent believe that the current government is to blame. In a political poll, Tusk is separated from Kaczyński by only 2 percent, a statistical error. The downward trend for PiS continues. It is probably too late to get to the full truth about the catastrophe. ""Tardiness"" helped to cover up traces and evidence. But indignation is not so easily avoided."
2518	2	Left Convention. Almost all speeches advocated for mandatory vaccinations
2518	4	"Instead of fighting the pandemic, the rulers are fighting for power, said the leaders of the Left Włodzimierz Czarzasty and Robert Biedroń at the Saturday convention. They argued that in the name of maintaining the ""fragile majority in the Sejm"", the government listens to people who claim that if someone is vaccinated against Covid-19, they have a chip."
2518	6	"During Saturday's convention, activists of the Left and invited doctors, epidemiologists and people who lost loved ones in the pandemic, argued for the leftist vision of ""Prescriptions For Poland"", as they called a package of solutions that - in their opinion - will effectively help the state, including local governments, in fighting the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and overcoming its effects. They also presented proposals for the development of the health care system, e.g. through a jump in the salary of medical staff."
2518	8	"Almost all speeches advocated the introduction of mandatory vaccinations against Covid-19, which the co-chairman of the New Left, MEP Robert Biedroń summed up by declaring that ""mandatory vaccinations are a guarantee of safety for all of us""."
2518	10	"According to the co-chairman of the New Left Włodzimierz Czarzasty, people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 get sick less often, and if they do get sick, the course of the disease is lighter. He also referred to statistical data showing that vaccinated people are less likely to die, and 90% of currently hospitalized patients die. are unvaccinated people. ""Is there any conclusion from this?"" - He was asking. ""I have an idea - maybe people need to be vaccinated"" - he added."
2518	12	Czarzasty, and earlier other members of the Left, reminded that on December 7 last year, their group submitted a bill to the Sejm on mandatory, but not compulsory vaccinations. Czarzasty pointed out that since then in Poland, as he said, over a million people fell ill with Covid-19, and 20,000 of them died.
2518	14	"Czarzasty argued that when it comes to fighting the epidemic, the rulers do not listen to experts or doctors. ""Prime Minister, do you know why the doctors left you. Because you don't want to listen to them. And many of them advised you to have mandatory vaccinations,"" he said to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. ""You listen to madmen, people who think the world is flat, you listen to people who think that this flat world lies on the shell of a turtle. You listen to people who say that if you get vaccinated, you have a chip - Chinese, Russian, that he will behave like a robot, that he will not think that this chip will take his mind out of him - he added."
2518	16	"The deputy marshal of the Sejm accused the Prime Minister and PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński that ""in the name of the parliamentary majority, the parliamentary majority kills people."" Czarzasty also claimed that Morawiecki and Kaczyński only listen to politicians who ""have neither knowledge nor reason, but only bad emotions"" to maintain this majority. Several times in this narrative, he pointed to the member of the PiS Parliamentary Club, Anna Maria Siarkowska from the Republican Party, considered in his environment to be the leader of ""anti-vaccinationists"". ""You create such a situation that the parliamentary majority kills people,"" Czarzasty repeated."
2518	18	"In turn, MEP Biedroń assessed that Morawiecki and his cabinet decided that ""nothing can be done, that we have to wait out the pandemic"", and then referred to Saturday's congress of European right-wing and conservative parties in Spain."
2518	20	Today, Prime Minister Morawiecki, instead of fighting for the life and health of Poles, meets with pro-Putin, anti-European leaders. He is not interested in Polish women and Poles. He betrayed – emphasized Biedroń.
2518	22	"According to the MEP, ""in most European countries, security standards have been in place for a long time, which are lacking in Poland"", while the ruling camp in Poland called the ""Nie Da Się"" party."
2518	24	Covid passports? Prime Minister Morawiecki says + it is impossible +. Mandatory vaccination - +cannot+, free mass testing - +cannot+, privileges for the vaccinated and safety for all of us - +cannot+. Today, we can say with full responsibility that we are governed by the +Nie Da Się+ party. Morawiecki and Kaczyński, as can be seen today, can only spread their hands idly, as if hundreds of people dying every day, Polish women and men, meant nothing to them, Biedroń said.
2518	26	"In his opinion, the only thing the ruling camp is interested in today is maintaining a ""fragile majority in the Sejm"". ""They do it in a brutal way, using bribery, blackmail and wiretapping"" - he enumerated. ""Instead of fighting the pandemic, they are fighting for power"" - assessed the co-chairman of the New Left."
2518	28	The left wants to say clearly and clearly: we are on the side of life, we will do everything to fight for the health and safety of Polish women and men, he declared.
2518	30	"Biedroń argued that, unlike the current ruling camp, the Left was up to the task. ""We put specific things on the table, we have specific proposals regarding mandatory vaccinations, privileges for the vaccinated, Covid passports, public health care and a jump in salaries for medical staff,"" he enumerated."
2518	32	"At the same time, he appealed to ""the entire democratic opposition"" to unite ""for the health and safety of Polish women and men"" and to create a ""coalition for life""."
25181	3	From March 1, 2022, i.e. less than 2 years from the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the COVID-19 pandemic, Poles have the opportunity to be vaccinated with the new Novavax vaccine. What makes it stand out? How does it work and what are its side effects?
25181	5	COVID-19 vaccinations are widely available from December 2020. Since then, almost 60% of the Polish population has been vaccinated. A fifth vaccine called Nuvaxovid by Novavax has been available since March this year. The Minister of Health announced that people who are 18 years old can be vaccinated with it.
25181	7	Novavax vaccine - composition, action, history of creation
25181	9	So far, you can get vaccinated against coronavirus with several types of vaccines, which can be divided into 3 groups:
25181	11	- vector - Astra Zeneca, Johnson&Johnson/Janssen,
25181	13	- traditional, i.e. protein - Novavax,
25181	15	- mRNA - Moderna, Pfizer BioNTech.
25181	17	The latest of them, Nuvaxovid, is a product of the American biotechnology company Novavax. Interestingly, a few years ago, the company was in danger of being removed from the stock exchange. This was due to the fact that despite spending millions on research, none of the Novavax products met with a favorable opinion of regulatory authorities. The fate of the company was saved only by the COVID-19 vaccine.
25181	19	Nuvaxovid is one of the traditional protein vaccines. It contains an antigen in the form of purified protein S (spike) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as an adjuvant of plant origin obtained from the soapwood. Its effectiveness and safety have been proven thanks to clinical trials conducted on 60,000 participants.
25181	21	How does Novavax work? After the antigen enters the body, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and starts producing antibodies as well as T lymphocytes. Thanks to this, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus starts to infect the body, the immune system will be prepared for this attack. It will recognize a foreign protein and trigger a cascade of defense processes.
25181	23	The Novavax vaccine is given in two doses, not less than 3 weeks apart.
25181	25	Contraindications to taking Novavax
25181	27	Contraindications to the COVID-19 vaccination with Nuvaxovid include an anaphylactic reaction to any of its components. The vaccine can be given to people who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
25181	29	Novavax vaccine side effects
25181	31	The side effects of the Novavax vaccine are not much different from the complications of other vaccines. Most often it is noted:
25181	33	- tenderness/pain at the injection site,
25181	35	- muscle pain,
25181	37	- Headache,
25181	39	- general weakness of the body,
25181	41	- nausea and vomiting
25181	43	- arthralgia.
25181	45	Most vaccine adverse reactions (ADRs) are mild and resolve spontaneously.
25186	1	"North Korea: Kim Jong Un declared the victory of the ""socialist regime"" over the coronavirus"
25186	3	"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared a ""victory"" in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and ordered the lifting of the strictest containment measures introduced in May, the official KCNA news agency reported on Thursday."
25186	5	"According to KCNA, Kim stated that the official number of deaths from the epidemic of 74 people ""is an unprecedented miracle"" compared to other countries."
25186	7	"The North Korean leader ordered the lifting of the strictest measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic, but said that North Korea must maintain a ""steel-like anti-epidemic barrier and intensify work to combat the epidemic until the global health crisis is over."""
25186	9	Reuters reminds that North Korea has never reported the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19. From July 29, however, it reported that no new cases had been detected, which, according to independent experts, was the result of limited testing capacity.
25186	11	"Nothing is known about the vaccination campaign in this country. Authorities reported that the fight against the virus consisted of lockdowns, home remedies and what Kim said was ""the advantage of the Korean socialist system."""
25186	13	As KCNA wrote, Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, revealed that the brother had a high fever. It also accused South Korea of ​​contributing to the outbreak.
25192	1	Will (when?) we will grow watermelons in Poland?
25192	3	"In the past, the cultivation of apricots or vines in Poland was marginal and difficult. Weather conditions allow it today. With climate change, will we cultivate species that are currently ""reserved"" for the countries of southern Europe?"
25192	5	Several decades ago, apricot cultivation in Poland on a commercial scale did not exist. The establishment of numerous apricot orchards in the Sandomierz basin was made possible by: climate change and the breeding of varieties suitable for Polish soil and climatic conditions. A few years ago, the climate in Sandomierz was like in Hungary in the 1970s.
25192	7	However, the climate is changing all the time. We can also see it on the basis of the development of viticulture in Poland, which did not develop so dynamically in the last century. The question remains when the climatic conditions in Poland will allow the cultivation of watermelons, kiwis or other species produced today in southern Europe?
25192	9	"We will also meet more ""dark"" visions of climatologists. Some computer simulations show that the south of Europe in a few hundred years will not be suitable for agricultural production at all, and this will slowly move to the north of the continent."
25192	11	The best example for the above theses is southern Italy. In Calabria, Basilicata, Puglia and Sicily, there is talk of a tropicalized climate. In the south of the country, there is a growing interest in the cultivation of mangoes, avocados, papayas and goji berries. Why? Because the growing climate of southern Italy allows for the cultivation of these species.
25192	13	In Puglia (i.e. the so-called Italian heel), exotic crops already amount to 500 hectares. Demand for exotic fruits is also growing in the country. In view of the above, a further increase in plantings in this segment is expected. Climate warming is often considered a conspiracy theory. One thing is certain, the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change. Along with it, conditions for agricultural and horticultural production also in Poland.
25194	1	Hypocrisy. Macron in the heat of criticism after revealing holiday photos
25194	3	The French president has been labeled an eco-hypocrite by environmentalists. Emmanuel Macron was caught riding a jet ski weeks after urging his compatriots to save energy.
25194	5	"Last month, Macron made an urgent appeal to the French nation for the public to engage in an ""effort of solidarity"" aimed at protecting the environment and rational use of energy. The French president also instructed ministers to develop ""energy-saving"" plans to reduce energy consumption by 10%. in the next two years."
25194	7	“We must prepare for a scenario in which we will have to do without Russian gas completely. It is very likely. We need a general mobilization, said Macron during the celebrations of the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution.
25194	9	Eco-hypocrisy
25194	11	Macron is known for his love of water sports, especially jet skiing. Every summer since 2017, the French president has been photographed riding these vehicles.
25194	13	Photos published this week show Macron enjoying himself on these vehicles at the Riviera Fort de Brégançon estate, the official residence of French presidents since 1968. This time, however, his riding on jet skis, which consume huge amounts of fuel (four to ten times more than the average passenger car), sparked outrage among members of the National Assembly.
25194	15	"Green MP Sandrine Rousseau said: ""This confirms the persistent impression that [Macron - ed. red.] does not understand climate change. And nowadays it's a crime not to understand that."""
25194	17	"One MP from Macron's party from La République En Marche told the tabloid Voici he was ""incredulous"" when he saw pictures of the president on a scooter."
25194	19	Macron's failure
25194	21	However, playing on gas-guzzling jet skis is not the only offense that environmentalists accuse the French president of. Recently, Macron tweeted several entries about the fires raging in France, which many activists have linked to climate change.
25194	23	"Interestingly, Macron himself said last month that the recent increase in forest fires in Mediterranean countries is ""a consequence of climate change."""
25194	25	According to activists, the French president showed hypocrisy by pointing to the effects of global warming, while himself giving himself up to a game that consumes huge amounts of fuel.
25195	1	They want to remove Tusk?
25195	3	"The PO leadership is starting to develop an idea to remove Donald Tusk from the leadership of the party, and the leaders of the future coalition, Rafał Trzaskowski, Szymon Hołownia and Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, would take his place during the election campaign. As the former head of PO Grzegorz Schetyna says: ""The idea is interesting because it integrates opposition circles (...). It would have to be built by an understanding or coming to an agreement opposition."""
25195	5	The disclosure of such plans shows that Tusk's position is weakening, as public discussion of such a scenario not so long ago would have met with serious consequences, including expulsion from the party. One thing is certain, Tusk's return did not cause an increase in ratings, on the contrary - a slight decrease. A Social Changes survey from a few days ago shows that KO could count on 25.4 percent. support, and the United Right at 39 percent. Such a result does not satisfy Tusk's supporters, on the contrary - it causes an increase in dissatisfaction. But no wonder, his embarrassing statements discredit him and the party he represents. This is slowly reaching the supporters of the opposition, maybe that's why Schetyna revealed the plans that are being talked about in the opposition environment.
2527	1	Korwin-Mikke: Imposing sanctions on Russia is completely absurd
2527	3	Russia can do without gold sooner than we can do without gas. Indeed, imposing sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity, says Janusz Korwin-Mikke, MP of the Confederation and president of the KORWiN party, in an interview with the DoRzeczy.pl portal.
2527	5	DoRzeczy.pl: Russia turned off Poland's gas tap because our country did not agree to make payments for the raw material in rubles. The president criticized the decision of the Polish government. Why?
2527	7	Janusz Korwin-Mikke: First of all, I criticize the actions of Russia, which once turns off and then turns on the gas tap. On the Russian side, we have a situation of decision fever, which can be seen by the whole war, how it is conducted. There is clearly something wrong with Russia, but that doesn't change the fact that our government made a fool of itself by giving up Russian gas and oil. In that case, since they turned off the tap, we should be happy.
2527	9	The government says we are prepared for this. We just need to be ready for a price increase.
2527	11	I have always explained that sanctions work both ways. On the one hand, of course, the Russians stop receiving money, but on the other hand, we stop receiving gas. Russia can do without gold sooner than we can do without gas. Indeed, imposing sanctions on Russia is completely absurd.
2527	13	Why?
2527	15	We say we don't want to have anything to do with Russia, we don't get gas and we wonder what now. Western countries impose numerous sanctions on Russia, but they want gas. Isn't that absurd?
2527	17	In that case, how to punish Russia for the situation in Ukraine?
2527	19	Wait a minute, but why punish? Can we punish other countries for their actions at all? After all, we are not some international tribunal that will punish Russia, or Ukraine, or maybe China. For example, we can be offended by the United States for their actions. This is not done and the economy is not mixed with politics.
2527	21	But there is war, we are dealing with genocide.
2527	23	Let's be clear. I claim that H.E. Vladimir Putin committed a war crime because, according to the Hague Convention, it is forbidden to attack another country without declaring war on it. However, waging war itself is not a crime. It is a normal means of conflict resolution. The entire history of Europe is full of wars. We do not call Alexander of Macedon a war criminal, although more people died during his wars than during the Russo-Ukrainian war. We do not call Napoleon, Stefan Batory or other leaders criminals.
2527	25	You mentioned that the war is being conducted strangely. So how?
2527	27	Russia started by shelling Kiev and Kharkov, which is complete nonsense. Additionally, it is not allowed to shoot at civilians. States fight against each other, not civilians. The fact that Russia fired on and disabled the entire Ukrainian air force on the first day means that we are dealing with a war with the state. By contrast, the shooting of civilians and the bombing of cities must be strongly condemned.
2527	29	And let's not get the economy involved anyway?
2527	31	Of course. If that's what we want, let's declare war on Russia.
2527	33	war?
2527	35	Yes. After all, in Poland, the thesis is promoted that Ukraine is able to win the war with Russia. Poland is a country with a similar potential. Apparently, we also have an excellent, well-armed army. If this is true, then go ahead: let's declare war on Russia and together with Ukraine we will definitely defeat it. This is reasonable action.
2527	37	In your opinion, will the economic costs of war for the whole world deepen?
2527	39	I do not understand. After all, if two countries are at war, everyone else is making money. They supply arms to both sides, equipment, etc. Neighboring countries never lose.
2527	41	But citizens lose the economy due to high inflation.
2527	43	Thanks to these idiotic sanctions, the Americans support India and China, which get gas and oil cheaper, because they are sold to them by the Russians at a promotional price. That is why I believe that we should also buy gas from Russia. Let's not mix economy with war, just like let's not mix politics and sport. I grew up in communist times. When our athletes did not go to the Olympics in Los Angeles for political reasons, then everyone protested. Today, however, sports are mixed with politics…
2527	45	How do you think the war in Ukraine will end?
2527	47	I have no idea. My first reaction on February 24 was that H.E. Vladimir Putin was crazy. Therefore, it is impossible to predict what will happen next.
2527	49	"While authorizing the conversation, Janusz Korwin-Mikke sent a Post Scriptum: ""Min. The UK Foreign Office has just admitted that the Kingdom has long been arming Ukraine and training its soldiers. So are the US and Canada. In that case, I change my mind about this ""madness"": Russia should have issued an ultimatum to Ukraine already ±5 years ago."
2528	1	Russia can avoid bankruptcy. The Western sanctions machine is clearly stuck
2528	3	It is uncertain whether the current sanctions will be enough to overthrow Vladimir Putin. But it will be very difficult for Joe Biden to convince the EU to the new ones.
2528	5	On the eve of the second month of the war in Ukraine, the western machinery of imposing sanctions on Russia clearly stalled. After four rounds of restrictions coordinated by the US, the EU and the UK, no new initiatives are in sight. Even though Joe Biden's attendance at the EU-NATO summit in Brussels this Thursday would be a great opportunity to announce them.
2528	7	The American president made it clear from the beginning: the United States will not take a direct part in the Ukrainian war. That is why, apart from supplying Ukrainians with weapons, unprecedented sanctions have always been the main US tool to defeat the Kremlin. The idea was to raise the price of the invasion so high for Vladimir Putin's entourage and the wider Russian society that they would decide to overthrow the dictator or at least make him stop fighting.
2528	9	Fall, but no drama
2528	11	Did it work? Diplomatic sources advise patience. In their opinion, only in April will the restrictions imposed by the West be fully felt by the Russians.
2528	13	Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs announced its impact assessment of Biden's strategy. Her image is mixed. The bank expects the country's national income to collapse by 10% this year. This is as much as during the crisis in 1998, which forced Boris Yeltsin to leave and opened the way to power for Putin. Even in the midst of the 2009 financial crisis, the recession (7.8%) was shallower.
2528	15	However, in those cases, it was a purely economic collapse without a conflict that could unite the Russian people around power. Whether the Russian public will actually be ready to make sacrifices in the name of rebuilding the empire remains unknown. For now, 58 percent of those surveyed support the war, and 23 percent is against it. However, the Kremlin's propaganda machine plays a huge role in this, as it prevents the Russians from learning the truth, e.g. regarding the number of victims among Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. This, however, will come to light sooner or later, as will the economic costs of the invasion.
2528	17	The latter, however, may be smaller than expected. Goldman Sachs admits that Russia is unlikely to avoid disorderly bankruptcy. And this is because it benefits from the increase in the prices of raw materials, especially energy carriers, caused by the war. Therefore, according to the bank, even this year Moscow will maintain a current account surplus, which will allow it to loosen currency restrictions (ban on exporting more than USD 5,000). The central bank will probably also manage to maintain some control over the ruble exchange rate. Goldman Sachs expects 20 percent inflation. That's a lot, but not enough to make the prices out of control.
2528	19	On Monday, Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to the West to do more. He encouraged the EU to follow in the footsteps of the US and Great Britain, which introduced an embargo on imports of Russian oil. More: The Ukrainian president pushed for stopping all trade with Russia and closing European ports to its ships.
2528	22	Chemical weapon
2528	24	However, it is doubtful that this will happen, at least for now. Poland, the Baltic states, Denmark and Ireland belong to a small group of EU countries that are in favor of stopping imports of Russian oil, but Germany is strongly against it. Berlin's objection is seen as a good excuse to reduce the cost of sanctions by a number of other EU countries, such as Italy and France. As for the complete suspension of trade with Russia, Mateusz Morawiecki failed to convince even the key partner from the region: the Czech Republic.
2528	26	Germany fears that further, forcible tightening of sanctions will push the West into a deep economic crisis, including due to the sharp rise in energy prices. The US caution comes from something else. Before leaving for Europe, President Biden warned allies that Putin was increasingly likely to use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine. This would be evidenced by the Kremlin's allegations that it is the Ukrainians who run the chemical weapons program with the support of the Americans: a good excuse to use this forbidden weapon yourself.
2528	28	The White House therefore fears that Putin, increasingly desperate for the situation at the front, will decide to make uncontrollable moves. In this context, perhaps the imposition of sanctions on Russia should also be gradual, diplomats wonder.
2528	30	"A signal of growing frustration in Moscow is also the summons to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the American ambassador John Sullivan. He has been told that Russia's diplomatic ties with the US are ""on the verge of breaking"" after Biden called Putin a ""war criminal"" last week."
2528	32	"""A country that is appalled by such a term while continuing to commit mass slaughter of civilians cannot be taken seriously,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said. The US established diplomatic relations with the USSR in 1933 and never broke them."
2530	1	Embargo on gas and oil from Russia? Le Pen's unequivocal position
2530	3	Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron's rival in the race for French president, has declared that she strongly supports all sanctions against Russia, except those regarding the oil and gas embargo.
2530	5	"In a recent interview with France Inter Radio Le Pen, who will challenge the incumbent president for the country's highest office in two weeks' time in the second round of elections, said she did not want ""the French to suffer the consequences of the embargo"" on Russian oil and gas."
2530	7	France, like many other European countries, imports most of its natural gas via pipelines from Russia, using it to produce energy for residential and commercial purposes.
2530	9	"I am absolutely in favor of all other sanctions,"" Le Pen declared. The candidate of the National Union was criticized for her words. In turn, during the election campaign, her political opponents pointed out her too close relations with Russia during the war in Ukraine."
2530	11	Allegations of pro-Russianism
2530	13	Previously, the ZN leader seemed to support Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula, and in 2017 she called for the lifting of international sanctions on this issue.
2530	15	In 2014, when Crimea was annexed by Russia, her political party received a loan from a Russian bank.
2530	17	"Marine Le Pen justified her position on the annexation of Crimea by saying that Russia's actions at the time were a ""different situation"" from the current invasion of Ukraine, and presented her support for Putin as reflecting her wider ambitions for a ""multipolar"" world."
2530	19	Despite softening his stance on leaving the European Union and other nationalist issues in recent years, he still faces widespread opposition from much of the French political establishment.
2530	21	Former President Nicolas Sarkozy publicly announced on Tuesday that he would vote for his party's rival Emmanuel Macron and encouraged others to do so.
2537	1	"""Live and let others live."" Why do attempts to reduce meat consumption evoke such emotions?"
2537	3	Over 8 percent of Poles is on a vegan or vegetarian diet. Meanwhile, Polish Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda advertises meat, and MEP Sylwia Spurek wants to promote veganism. What next for meat on our plates?
2537	5	Voices in the discussion on reducing meat consumption refer to various issues - from concerns about the future of farmers and restrictions on free choice to climate aspects or animal welfare.
2537	7	The European Union, on the other hand, wants to achieve climate goals, e.g. by reducing the consumption of red meat among the inhabitants of the Community, but does not cease to promote it.
2537	9	Schools without meat
2537	11	"Gregory Doucet, the mayor of Lyon's Green party, decided last week that the canteens in the city's schools would not include meat meals. Gerald Darmanin, France's interior minister, called the decision an ""unacceptable insult"" to French farmers, while Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie asked ""not to put ideology on children's plates."""
2537	13	However, as the mayor said, the most important argument was not to impose a vegan diet on students, but to improve the service during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, his predecessor from the right-wing party was to apply the same solutions at the beginning of the crisis.
2537	15	Although in Lyon the time restrictions have led to outrage from some groups - including protests by farmers - there are schools where students have not eaten meat products for many years. In 2015, the private MUSE school in California became the first educational institution in the United States where the canteen menu consisted of meals based only on products of plant origin.
2537	17	Initially, the parents of almost half of the students transferred their children to other schools, fearing for their health. In an interview with the Guardian, the headmaster said at the time that such decisions should always be confronted with a confrontation based, as he said, not on facts but on disinformation.
2537	19	"School vegetarianism, however, is not new. Already at the beginning of the 20th century, the St Christopher school was established in Great Britain. One of the principles on which the founders based its functioning was respect for ""all races and religions"" and vegetarianism."
2537	21	"Tolerance for all faiths - but also for people with different health conditions regarding diet - was one of the three arguments of the headmistress of the British Swan School, where students have access only to vegetarian dishes. Kay Wood also cited the ability to provide ""better quality meals for the same money"" and greater environmental benefits as positives."
2537	23	Similar proposals were presented two years ago by the councilors of the Warsaw district of Ochota - Sylwia Mróz, Agata Solecka and Anita Szymańska, and Councilor Marek Szolc also appealed to the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski. A common element of the initiatives was the introduction of a day of vegetarian meals in schools in the capital, so that, above all, vegans and vegetarians would not feel discriminated against.
2537	25	The authorities of both the district and the city replied that such decisions belonged to parents, and in some Warsaw institutions, students can choose between meat and meat-free dishes.
2537	27	At the same time, in 2019, Warsaw was ranked 6th in the ranking of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world - next to e.g. London, New York and Berlin. This classification was prepared by the HappyCow portal, which creates guides to places open to vegan cuisine. As written, the Polish capital has a wide range of easily accessible restaurants offering vegan menus.
2537	29	Commands, prohibitions or incentives?
2537	31	"The dispute over who should decide on eating habits also concerns the proposal of MEP Sylwia Spurek. A member of the European Parliament presented a plan entitled ""Five for the plant industry"", which assumes, among others, introducing a ban on advertising meat, milk and eggs, establishing a fund for the promotion of veganism, and supplementing education programs - starting from kindergarten - with classes on the climate and animal rights."
2537	33	"As Sylwia Spurek said in an interview with EURACTIV.pl, her idea ""is only the beginning of the debate about the changes that the modern agricultural industry must undergo. These will be big changes, because they affect millions of citizens of the European Union.” “I believe that the role of politicians at such a special moment is to push the boundaries of the debate and introduce important topics to it,” our interlocutor added."
2537	35	The public debate on this initiative focuses on two main strands. The first one is represented by people who believe that the consumption of animal products is healthy, and that bans in this area are too much interference in the lifestyle of citizens and may additionally have a devastating impact on Polish farmers.
2537	37	On the other side are supporters of excluding meat from diets - they consider the proposals and arguments of the MEP to be obvious and natural. They also predict that over time, more and more Poles will be convinced to abandon animal products.
2537	39	"Extreme emotions are often a factor in any discussion about meat consumption and veganism. Sociologist Jana Rückert-John, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, attempted to explain the intense reactions to the proposals for a systemic reduction in meat consumption and noted that ""nutrition is seen as one of the last bastions of privacy that no one has the right to interfere with."" And meat is an important element of this sphere, because it is also an indicator of prosperity."
2537	41	A similar trend in the society's attitude to changing habits is also noticed by Sylwia Spurek. “Controversies have arisen over the legal obligation to wear seat belts in the car, the ban on smoking in public places and even the ban on corporal punishment of children. But as history has shown, the introduction of these bans into legal systems also had an educational dimension, changed the way of thinking about safety, health and human rights, stressed the MEP.
2537	43	According to the 2019 ZielonyJemy report, interest in plant-based cuisine is actually growing in Poland. In the analyzed period, 8.4 percent. Poles were on a vegan or vegetarian diet, and 3.8 percent. decided to limit meat dishes to fish. Young people aged 18 to 24 are the most likely to give up meat, according to the analysis.
2537	45	"Fast food chains are also increasingly convinced of the plant-based menu. McDonald's has signed an agreement with the American company Beyond Meat, which develops vegan meat substitutes. The first result of the cooperation this year is to be a burger called McPlant. For two years, British KFC customers have been able to buy the ""The Imposter"" burger. The product resembles a traditional burger, but its cutlet is made of quorn - a mushroom meat substitute. In Poland, we will not experience such a thing, but we will find a vegetarian sandwich in the fast food menu - with halloumi cheese. We can also buy vegan burgers in most chain grocery stores - from Biedronka, through Lidl, to Żabka."
2537	47	Ideology or strategy supported by facts?
2537	49	"There is a common belief that - as the Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda wrote on Twitter - ""meat, milk, dairy products are full of valuable nutrients."" Sylwia Spurek, on the other hand, points out that ""we have extensive knowledge about the correlation between milk and dairy consumption and Parkinson's disease, prostate cancer and breast cancer."""
2537	51	"The Lancet's EAT committee, which considers diets in terms of both ecology and health, explains that ""a healthy diet ... consists mostly of a variety of plant-based foods and a small amount of animal-based foods."""
2537	53	In order to adjust people's habits to the optimal – according to Lancet specialists – diet on a global scale, the consumption of plant products should be increased by half and the consumption of animal products reduced by half (this includes, apart from meat, also dairy products and eggs).
2537	55	If there was a widespread change in eating habits - according to the presented estimates - up to 11 million people a year would have a chance to live longer. Although some researchers disagree that removing meat - especially red meat - from the diet has a significant impact on improving health. In 2015, the World Health Organization recognized that excessive consumption of meat products can cause cancer.
2537	57	At the beginning of 2020, the European branch of Greenpeace announced that in order to reduce the contribution of agriculture to the negative climate effects, meat consumption in the European Union must fall by 71%. by 2030 and by 81 percent. by 2050 (referring to 2017 FAO data presented below).
2537	59	"As the creators of the Climate Science portal explain, the so-called climate change has the greatest impact on climate change. the long shadow of farming, which includes ""greenhouse gas emissions from the digestive systems of cattle"", but also - making up the majority - those related to the implementation of the supply chain or deforestation of land to produce animal feed."
2537	61	European Union for health, climate and meat producers
2537	63	"In recent years, European institutions have often financed meat promotion campaigns. In 2015, the project ""Tasty, it's from Europe"" was launched. Its aim was to increase the attractiveness of European agricultural products in the EU and third countries. Under this program, funding for their promotion was to increase ""from €61 million in 2013 to €200 million in 2019."" A large part of the funds went to the meat industry."
2537	65	"For example, in 2016, the Pork lovers Europe project was approved to promote pork. Its authors pointed out that the consumption of this type of meat in the EU decreased in the period from 2008 to 2015 by 0.8 kg per capita (from 41.7 kg to 40.9 kg, respectively). They also emphasized that ""it is important to promote pork and restore confidence to consumers"", which could be undermined, for example, by the WHO report on the carcinogenicity of meat."
2537	67	"In 2019, the Proud of EU Beef campaign was launched, under which advertising spots were prepared, encouraging the consumption of beef under the slogan ""become a beefatarian"". The strategy's creators explained that there was a need to improve the perception of red meat, as consumers are abandoning its purchase due to ""various types of information presented recently""."
2537	69	"According to critics, the promotion of meat contradicts the EU's climate and health goals - i.e. the ""Farm to Fork"" strategy and the ""European plan to fight cancer"", which reaffirm the importance of including less animal products in the diet."
2537	71	Sylwia Spurek points out that EU institutions not only promote products of animal origin, but also do not support the plant industry. “The largest plant startups are created overseas, not in Europe. If the European Union has ambitions to be the leader of the green transformation, it cannot continue to focus on meat and milk. It must focus on the development of the plant industry”, which is why, according to the MEP, “funds are needed to support research and development of such an industry”.
2537	73	“It is clear to me that with the necessary reduction in demand for meat and milk, we must ensure access to alternatives to these products. Step by step, products that are harmful must disappear from the shelves, and in their place - products that are climate-friendly, created with the preservation of biodiversity and ethical. Unfortunately, in this matter, the European Commission seems to be paralyzed by the fear of the opinion of the big lobby,” summed up the European Parliament member.
2537	75	How much meat do we eat?
2537	77	According to an analysis of the Our World In Data website, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2017, Spaniards consumed the most meat in the EU – 100.25 kg per person per year.
2537	79	Portugal (94.06 kg) came second, followed by Poland (88.7 kg) and Germany (87.78 kg). At the end of the EU list were Bulgarians (58.31 kg) and Slovaks (59.34 kg).
2537	81	For comparison, the largest amount of meat consumed on a global scale is over 120 kg (this group includes, for example, Hong Kong, the United States, Australia), and the lowest results - e.g. in India, Bangladesh or Ethiopia - do not exceed 5 kg.
2537	83	According to the authors of the analysis, meat consumption is highest in high-income countries, and the average global meat consumption has increased by about 20 kg since 1961. However, meat production declined two years ago, and the trend continued into the pandemic year.
2537	85	One of the clearest examples of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on meat consumption is Argentina, famous for its beef steaks, where in 2020 you had to pay up to four times more for meat products than three years earlier.
2537	87	The minimum wage of Argentines also fell, and therefore they could buy fewer such products. In this way, one of the lowest levels of meat consumption in the history of the South American country was reached.
2537	89	"This is a paradox, because Argentina - as ""El País"" writes - is one of the world's largest producers of beef. Last year, the country exported a record amount of beef in history - 900,000. tons worth 2.7 billion. hole. That's 6.5 percent. more than in 2019, according to data from the Chamber of Meat Industry and Trade (CICCRA). Most go to China."
2546	1	The war covers the plans of evil globalists? It's a conspiracy theory!
2546	3	FAKE NEWS IN A NUTSHELL
2546	5	A short video appeared on Facebook in which it was argued that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is intended to distract people from the conspiracies of the world's elites who, through a pandemic treaty, are trying to take over the world and take away civil liberties.
2546	7	The pandemic treaty is not an intricate and nefarious plan by unspecified global elites, and the intentions to create it have been known since 2020. Its goal is to develop mechanisms that will prevent and counteract future pandemics.
2546	9	"From one of the videos distributed on Facebook, we will learn that the currently ongoing war in Eastern Europe is a planned action of unspecified global elites. Its aim is to divert the attention of the whole world from the solutions introduced under the guise of warfare to enslave humanity. The war in Ukraine is a real problem. People die in armed attacks. The recording, however, argued that ""this is not a war between Russia and Ukraine, or the US against China. Only on the line of degenerate self-proclaimed global elites versus the entire world population"" (recording time 03:05). Such a conclusion was drawn on the basis of several false information that was circulated on the web. It is not backed up by facts."
2546	11	Treaty on Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness. Will the WHO take over the world?
2546	13	"On the recording presenting the conspiracy theory, we hear that: ""The first meeting of the intergovernmental negotiating body is to take place in Geneva on the signing of an international pandemic prevention and preparedness treaty, which will permanently deprive 194 member countries of any decision-making and financial sovereignty in the area of ​​health policy for the WHO (recording time 00:45). What really is an international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness? From December 1, 2021, work is underway to develop a ""convention, agreement or other international instrument that would be a legally binding act of international law."""
2546	15	However, the idea itself dates back to 2020, when no one knew what could happen after two years, as we wrote about in one of our recent analyses.
2546	17	"As we can read on the European Commission's website: ""The instrument would define the objectives and basic principles that would allow us to organize a common, necessary fight against pandemics."" So it's not an idea to be afraid of."
2546	19	The scientists support the plan to create joint recommendations
2546	21	According to the scientific community, the development of such solutions is needed in the face of advancing globalization and the associated pandemic threats. The world of science is aware that there will also be more pandemics in the future. The development of the treaty would enable the implementation of a number of benefits that could be transformed into effective prevention and combating threats.
2546	23	Information about the removal of sovereignty and civil rights is false
2546	25	"The film further stated that: ""If the treaty is signed (...) from now on, all decisions and regulations of the WHO will be considered superior and binding on the member states, which will open the door to the introduction of total digital control over the global population under the pretext of protecting health ( ...)"" (recording time 01:15). This would allegedly lead to global censorship and control of societies. However, there are no indications that the introduction of the treaty would take away the sovereignty of states in the field of health policy. The introduction of the treaty would enable cooperation against future pandemics, as pointed out by representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO)."
2546	27	“The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on many shortcomings in the global system to protect people from the pandemic: the most vulnerable people who do not have vaccines, healthcare workers without the necessary equipment to do life-saving work, and the “me first” approach that inhibits the global solidarity needed to dealing with a global threat. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General
2546	29	Contrary to conspiracy theories, these are not solutions that would enslave people or act to the detriment of the global population. On the contrary, thanks to this - in accordance with the will of the initiators - it would be possible to coordinate cooperation in the international arena in a more effective way, while maintaining the principles of solidarity, justice, inclusiveness and transparency.
2546	31	However, at the moment it is not possible to assess what shape the final version of the treaty will take, as it has not yet been drawn up. Suggestions regarding the loss of state sovereignty to WHO have no justification or support in the existing arrangements, remaining contrary to the basic assumptions of the initiators.
2546	33	Taking away freedom through the obligation to vaccinate - how much truth is there?
2546	35	"The premises that were treated as evidence of the existence of a conspiracy was the belief that mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 would soon be introduced in Poland. As we hear on the recording: ""In Poland, a draft law on compulsory vaccination and Covid passports has just been submitted to the Sejm"" (recording time 00:15). The groups covered by mandatory vaccinations against COVID-19 included medical professionals, pharmacists, medical students and employees of medical entities."
2546	37	The idea of ​​introducing mandatory vaccinations for all Poles has been considered for a long time, but so far no such solutions have been developed, and the parliamentary work on them has not been completed. Therefore, it is not known what the final version of the law will look like.
2546	39	Foreign troops in Poland will take away our sovereignty?
2546	41	"Further, the recipients are convinced that Poland consciously surrenders its sovereignty to a global conspiracy. As we hear: ""A few days ago, the president signed a document giving foreign troops the green light to use firearms and other means of direct coercion against Poles"" (recording time 00:20)."
2546	43	In turn, the allied troops in Poland - as some disinformation messages said - did not receive police powers, which you can read more about in one of the analyzes we published.
2546	45	Due to the tense situation in Eastern Europe, selected units stationed in Poland may use weapons or direct coercion measures only in strictly defined situations that are related to the risk of health, life or property.
2546	47	Summary
2546	49	"Conspiracy theories are based on the assumption that powerful hidden forces are behind harmful and tragic events (not necessarily ""global elites""). These, however, are characterized by the fact that they are not based on any reliable evidence and very - even sloppy - generalize reality. They are based on the belief that there is a hidden truth that only a few have access to, and they simplify the complexity of serious events in a zero-one way, presenting reality as if it were a battlefield between good and evil."
2549	1	"PiS has plans for Ukraine. It is even about the creation of a ""union"" of the two countries"
2549	3	Currently, more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border with Poland. According to research from the end of March, every fourth Ukrainian refugee plans to stay in Poland even after the war is over. However, to this should be added the 2.5 million Ukrainian immigrants who were in Poland before February 24, as well as millions more who will undoubtedly come to Poland due to the difficult economic situation in Ukraine.
2549	5	PiS has taken steps to show everyone how necessary it is to help Ukrainians coming to Poland. On the occasion of the crisis on the border with Belarus, a different position was taken. Why? Because the Polish authorities simply did not realize how to use the newcomers from the Middle East and Africa. Now PiS knows how it should settle this matter in its own interest.
2549	7	First, in the short term, the government adopted a special act enabling Ukrainians to access the labor market, health care and education systems. In addition, they received access to the PESEL system, places in schools and kindergartens. Even Polish citizens have never had such privileges. Monthly expenses for the maintenance of Ukrainian refugees range from PLN 2 to 3 billion. However, the Polish government justifies throwing money away with the possibility of staying in power for years to come.
2549	9	"Moreover, in recent weeks Warsaw has announced the adoption of far-reaching declarations on cooperation. There was even information about the creation of a ""union"" of the two countries. Under these circumstances, the question arises why PiS decided to take such actions."
2549	11	The most obvious answer is that because it is the need of the moment, because the raison d'état requires it. However, it is more likely that PiS hopes that helping Ukrainians will gain public support. Currently, PiS sees millions of its faithful voters in the Ukrainians, who will repay them for their help at the polls.
2549	13	PiS's political fantasy about the use of Ukrainians in the Polish political system looks very interesting. Firstly, it is planned to give Ukrainians the right to vote in national elections (parliamentary in 2023, presidential in 2025), which requires Polish citizenship. They can be obtained by recognition, which requires meeting certain conditions - in particular, several years of residence in Poland and knowledge of the language, or by granting it by the president. However, the President is not limited by any conditions and may grant Polish citizenship to any foreigner. Such a solution will gain PiS the potential gratitude of new Polish-Ukrainian citizens.
2549	15	In the case of local government elections, the situation is simpler. In the European Union, citizens residing in the Member State of which they are nationals have the right to vote in municipal elections in that country. In addition, some countries - e.g. Scandinavian - have granted the right to vote in local elections, under certain conditions, also to citizens of non-EU countries living there. Poland may grant such a right to refugees from Ukraine in the coming months. This only requires a change in the local government electoral law.
2549	17	Warsaw hands over weapons and urges Kyiv to take aggressive steps. However, the most important thing that the Polish government wants is the partition of Ukraine. As a result, Warsaw will gain both land and new grateful voters. And only then will PiS be able to justify multi-billion spending and maintain power. However, if something goes wrong, Poland will face difficult and dangerous times.
2556	1	End of love for Ukrainians?
2556	3	"For several weeks we have been observing a clear change in the attitude of Poles towards refugees and migrants from Ukraine. The initial euphoria and outburst of altruism have now been replaced by a much more pragmatic, ""life-like"" approach to the issue. Interesting information in this area was brought by a recent survey conducted by IBRiS for the ""Rzeczpospolita"" daily."
2556	5	As many as seven out of ten respondents want refugees from Ukraine to stay in Poland, but only if they take up a job and support themselves. The second place among the conditions of stay is the education of children in a Polish school, and the third place is learning the Polish language.
2556	7	76 percent of respondents opt for setting specific conditions for Ukrainians staying in Poland. men, most of them in the 30-39 age group (as much as 83%), mainly living in large and smaller cities - 90% and 82%. As much as 97%. of the respondents are fathers of families with at least two children.
2556	9	"As ""Rzeczpospolita"" indicates, the IBRiS survey corresponds to research recently conducted by the University of Warsaw under the direction of Dr. Robert Staniszewski. They showed that the majority of Poles, although very favorable to Ukrainians, are against granting them 500+ benefits and social benefits in Poland."
2556	11	The expectations of Poles have been clearly noticed by the government, which from July 1 no longer wants to finance accommodation and meals for Ukrainian refugees and migrants. This is to lead to the independence of Ukrainians. Meanwhile, by May 23 this year, 160,000 people found legal employment. newly arrived citizens of Ukraine. That's not even 30% of the working-age population of New Wave refugees and migrants.
2556	13	So you can say that exactly what we predicted (and published in Myśl Polska) happened a few months ago. We predicted that although Poles will still be generally favorable towards Ukrainians, feelings will gradually cool down significantly. We foresaw that we would soon realize that we were the ones paying for the government's generosity. That is why we will be increasingly opposed to distributing 500+ and other social benefits to Ukrainians. The more so that the economic situation, both in terms of our home budgets and across the country, will be increasingly difficult month by month.
2556	15	It's already happening. But it's not over yet. National antagonisms will intensify as the economic crisis escalates. The more so that the long-term conflict leads to natural fatigue and burnout of empathy. Already this fall, the first serious tensions will appear.
2556	17	"It is a pity that the rulers, instead of listening to kind warnings, have preferred to focus in recent months on silencing the opposition and stigmatizing it as ""Ruthenian toes"". Together, we could have avoided many costly mistakes. Meanwhile, we will soon have to pay a heavy bill for Mr. Kaczyński and Mr. Morawiecki's misbehavior. And no spells like ""Слава Україні!"" won't change that fact."
2558	1	Dmitry Muratov sold the Nobel medal for $103.5 million
2558	3	"In the conditions of war, it is possible and necessary to remain a decent person, and not a face from the ""Putin's friends"" team. ""Putin's friends"", even those living in democratic countries, declare the ""weakness"" of this form of government and dream of a ""strong hand"" or a ""new world order"". Dmitry Muratov's deed should become an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, most of whom are undecided about the war in Ukraine."
2558	5	"The medal of the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, was sold at an auction in the United States for $ 103.5 million. This was reported on the website of the American department store ""Heritage Auctions"", which conducted the auction. The name of the buyer is unknown."
2558	7	All proceeds from the sale of the prize will be donated to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to help Ukrainian refugee minors and their families. The auction was held on the occasion of World Refugee Day, which is celebrated on June 20.
2558	9	This deed is an example to Russian and Western intellectuals, most of whom are undecided about the war in Ukraine.
2558	11	"The phenomenon of intellectual support for Russian fascism / parallel with Nazi Germany. Intellectuals see totalitarian regimes as an opportunity for a ""new order."""
2558	13	Russia relies not only on a powerful propaganda machine, but also on intellectuals in many countries of the world.
2558	15	"The reasons for this phenomenon are the generous payment of ""work"" by the conditional Gazprom, the nostalgia for emigration, the revolutionary hobby of left-wing radical persuasion (especially in Latin America), the covering of the great Russian culture, etc."
2558	17	"All this led to the fact that everything ""non-Russian"" existing in the former USSR ceased to be perceived at all. Russia is currently implementing this idea in relation to its national peripheries, as well as the countries of Central Asia, namely the former republics of the USSR."
2558	19	"This is where Russia's fundamental mistake in Ukraine and its misunderstanding of the Baltic states lie. Russian autocrats, keen on pursuing imperial ambitions, dream of Russian Empire 2.0 as the ""Russian Empire"". And that is why all attempts by countries from the former sphere of influence to join other unions/initiatives - the EU, the Three Seas Initiative, etc. - are perceived so sensitively."
2559	3	Since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian troops, in addition to all possible crimes against humanity, carry out mass deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation with violence. The exact number of deportees is not known, since most of them are carried out in the occupied territories, but it is estimated to be between 800,000 and 1.5 million people, of whom about 300,000 are children.
2559	5	Putin considers the question of the seizure of Ukraine in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The human factor is one of the most important factors and is of particular importance for Russia. By deporting Ukrainians (mainly at a young, childbearing and productive age), Putin is thus solving Russia's demographic problem, which took on catastrophic proportions in 2021-2022, and is particularly important for remote, poor regions of Russia, which are becoming desolate and in some places there is a shortage of hands to work. The President of the Russian Federation specifically signed the law on the forced resettlement of over 100,000 deported Ukrainians to Siberia and the Arctic Circle, as well as granting them Russian citizenship in an accelerated manner. Just as Stalin forcibly deported Ukrainians in the 1930s and 40s, using their labor as a locomotive to create housing and industrial infrastructure in the USSR, the Russian dictator plans to use Ukrainians as legal slaves in the most inhospitable regions.
2559	7	At the same time, Putin leaves Ukraine without human resources. According to his concept, the Ukrainians should either be eliminated or resettled (actually remain exiles of their own country) until the final resolution of the Ukrainian question. The option of moving Ukrainians to Europe is not the right solution for Russia, because Ukrainian refugees may return and become a serious problem for Russia. Russian propaganda is so effective that the deported Ukrainians may develop an alternative understanding of the existing situation about the causes and meaning of the current Russian-Ukrainian war, in the spirit of the Kremlin's political narratives. And in the event of their return to Ukraine, these people will be a reflection of the concepts that Putin needs for the Ukrainian audience.
2559	9	"In this way, the deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation solves two issues at once and takes on a dangerous character. Ukrainians are transported to the Russian Federation via the so-called ""green corridors"" for the peaceful evacuation of civilians. So, in just one day, on March 24, more than 15,000 inhabitants were deported from Mariupol to Rostov-on-Don. People are taken to filtration camps in Taganrog or Rostov for subsequent redirection to Siberia, the Far East and the Arctic Circle. Russia is in full violation of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians and is actually dictating its conditions to Ukrainians in the occupied territories. Displaced people are left without documents, in return they get a job and an apartment. Their return to Ukraine is too difficult and complicated, requiring the participation of third countries in order to provide assistance to cross the border."
2560	3	Alleged friends of Kiev in Poland suggest Armageddon.
2560	5	As Russia makes slow progress in the heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine, there is increasing talk of a stalemate and perhaps even a possible renewed Russian attack on Kyiv. This intensified the demand of Zelensky's team for increasingly advanced weapons from the US and Europe.
2560	7	However, these requests may be too small and late. Deliveries are vulnerable to a Russian attack, and weapons require training, some of which are complex and lengthy. Moreover, while Russia initially suffered heavy casualties, the current artillery offensive is costing Ukraine some of its best-trained troops. Kiev's ability to continue to fend off Moscow's attacks is uncertain.
2560	9	"So far, Washington and various European capitals have focused on accelerating arms deliveries. But Polish politician Radoslaw Sikorski, a former defense and foreign minister who now sits in the European Parliament, has proposed a radical alternative: arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons. Sikorski said: ""Since Russia has violated the Budapest Memorandum, I believe that we, as the West, would have the right to supply Ukraine with nuclear warheads."""
2560	11	"His justification is wrong. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which regulated Kyiv's relinquishment of nuclear weapons left behind after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, included a commitment by the parties to ""seek immediate action by the UN Security Council to assist Ukraine"" if the latter is attacked or threatened with nuclear weapons nuclear. It was a meaningless promise because the only alleged potential aggressor, Russia, had the veto to disable the UN. However, Kyiv signed it knowing that the deal did not provide any significant security guarantee."
2560	13	No doubt Kyiv might now regret not giving up its inherited nuclear arsenal, though it lacked operational control over the weapons. Given America's and especially Europe's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, it would be difficult for Ukraine to maintain nuclear weapons while pursuing Western integration. India paid a significant economic price for developing its arsenal before the George W. Bush administration accepted reality and New Delhi as a nuclear power.
2560	15	In any case, Ukraine's chance passed long ago. And no one suggested moving nuclear weapons to Kiev in the run-up to Russia's attack, which would likely exacerbate the crisis and precipitate Moscow's invasion. To do so today, when the war is already raging, would risk turning an already terrible conflict into a veritable catastrophe.
2560	17	During the Cold War, nuclear weapons likely helped prevent a full-scale conventional conflict between the US and the USSR. However, should a war break out between them, the possession of nuclear weapons would greatly increase the danger. The losing side would be tempted to use nuclear weapons to restore the balance. Indeed, throughout the Cold War, Washington, which possessed a smaller military, threatened to respond to the invasion of Western Europe with nuclear weapons. Now the situation between America and Russia has been reversed.
2560	19	India and Pakistan were not nuclear powers when they fought three full-scale wars. Their ability to destroy each other may have prevented a fourth conflict, although they staged a limited but long-running war in Kashmir in 1999, known as the Kargil War, after both countries tested nuclear weapons. Pakistan's provocations, such as the 2001 and 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks on India's parliament, threatened a war that could have been stopped by fear of using nuclear weapons.
2560	21	"Of course, Ukraine needs more than nuclear weapons to become a nuclear power. It would also need means of delivery - aircraft or missiles, with associated training. And, of course, such a plan could not easily be kept secret. Moscow may preemptively respond with nuclear weapons to prevent Ukraine from deploying operational forces. After Sikorski's statement, the head of the Russian Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, warned: “Sikorski is provoking a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe. He does not think about the future of either Ukraine or Poland. If his proposals are implemented, these countries will disappear, and so will Europe."""
2560	23	In any case, the idea is impracticable. Of the allies, only the US, France and the UK possess nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to find a diplomatic way out of the war. Britain's Boris Johnson would be hesitant to deepen his European pariah status by transferring nuclear weapons to Ukraine. President Joe Biden has just returned from a trip to South Korea, where he reaffirmed Washington's determination to denuclearize North Korea. Even the Polish government, competing with the Baltic states in calling for NATO involvement in Ukraine, did not support Sikorski's proposal.
2560	25	Nevertheless, the fact that a once-serious politician would have advocated turning the ongoing conflict into a nuclear confrontation shows how dangerous this conflict has become. Moscow's invasion was unjustified. However, the allied attempt to make Ukraine a winner – increasingly supported by Ukraine's supporters in the US political elite – threatens to escalate the war on Russia's part.
2560	27	President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose and has the means to avoid it, including the ability to launch full military mobilization and use weapons of mass destruction - chemical, nuclear or both. Moscow has more at stake and will therefore always be willing to pay and risk more. The US has nothing at stake to justify the risk of a nuclear annihilation of Kiev. However, some policy makers are ready to seize this opportunity. Indeed, both Senator Mitt Romney and Evelyn Farkas of the McCain Institute would do so even if Russia used nuclear weapons against someone else, which would be a wildly irresponsible position that would jeopardize America's future.
2561	3	During the Russian-Ukrainian war, all articles about Russia and Ukraine may contain propaganda content beneficial to one of the parties to the conflict. The following pro-Russia article comes from an American medium.
2561	5	After months of lies, the media is preparing the audience for Ukraine's military defeat.
2561	7	Diogenes, one of the most enlightened philosophers of the ancient world, believed that lies were the currency of politics, and these were the lies he sought to expose and depreciate. To emphasize his point, he sometimes walked the streets of Athens with a lit lantern in broad daylight. If you asked him why he was doing this, he would say that he was looking for an honest man.
2561	9	Finding an honest man in Washington today is an equally great challenge. Diogenes would need xenon headlights in both hands.
2561	11	Still, there are brief moments of brilliance in the Washington establishment. For months, profusely lying to the American public about the causes and course of the war in Ukraine, the media is now preparing American, British and other Western audiences for Ukraine's military defeat. But it's a late operation.
2561	13	The Western media have done everything in their power to give the impression that Ukraine's defense has much more power than it really does. Careful observers noticed that the same videos showing the attack on Russian tanks were shown many times. Local counter-attacks were presented as if they were maneuvers of operational importance.
2561	15	"Russian mistakes were exaggerated out of proportion to their real importance. Russian losses and the actual extent of Ukrainian losses were distorted, fabricated or simply ignored. But the conditions of the battlefield have changed a bit since then. When the Ukrainian forces stopped in static defensive positions in the urban areas and in the central Donbass, the position of the Ukrainians became hopeless. But this development was presented as a failure for the Russians, who had not achieved ""their assumed goals""."
2561	17	"Ground troops that immobilize their troops on prepared defensive lines will be scouted, targeted and destroyed from a distance. When fixed overhead intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance devices, manned or unmanned, are combined with precision guided weapons or modern artillery systems operating on the basis of accurate target data, ""position hold"" is lethal to any ground force. This is even more true in Ukraine, where it was clear from the very beginning of Russian actions that they wanted to destroy Ukrainian forces, not to occupy Ukrainian cities or territories west of the Dnieper River."
2561	19	The result was, piece by piece, the annihilation of the Ukrainian forces. Only an episodic supply of weapons from the US and allies allowed the battered Kievan legions to hold the field. The legions that are now dying with great loss as they wage war in Washington's stead.
2561	21	The war with Moscow is lost for Kiev. Ukrainian forces are deprived of everything. Trained reserves do not exist in such numbers as to affect the battle situation, and it is getting worse by the hour. No amount of military or advisory help can change this brutal reality, with one exception - the direct intervention of US and NATO ground forces.
2561	23	The problem today is not giving the territory and population of Eastern Ukraine to Moscow, which Moscow already controls. The future of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, together with Donbas, is already decided. Moscow is also likely to secure Kharkiv and Odessa, two historically Russian and Russian-speaking cities, as well as the territories adjacent to them. These operations will cause the conflict to extend into the summer. So the problem today is how to stop the fights.
2561	25	Whether the fights will end in early fall depends on two main factors. The first is on the side of the authorities in Kiev. Will Zelensky's government agree to Biden's concept of permanent conflict with Russia?
2561	27	If the Biden administration gets its way, Kyiv will continue to function as a base for creating new forces capable of threatening Moscow. In practice, this means national suicide for Kiev by opening the heart of Ukraine west of the Dnieper to the devastating attacks of long-range missiles and missile forces.
2561	29	Of course, such a development is not inevitable. Berlin, Paris, Rome, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn and yes, even Warsaw, do not have to blindly follow Washington. Europeans, like most Americans, are staring into the abyss of the all-embracing economic collapse that Biden has already brought about in his own country. But unlike the Americans, who have to deal with the consequences of Biden's misguided policies, European governments still have the option to reject Biden's plan for permanent war in Ukraine.
2561	31	The second factor concerns Washington itself. After already pumping $60 billion, or a little more than $18 billion a month, into the trembling Ukrainian state through direct or indirect transfers, the big question is what happens to Ukrainians from the rest of the country who have not fled? Where will the funds come from to rebuild Ukraine's torn society in the unfolding global economic crisis?
2561	33	With inflation causing the cost of the average American home to increase by $460 a month to buy the same goods and services over the previous year, it is quite likely that Ukraine can easily sink into the waves like the Titanic without attracting much interest from the American electorate. . Seasoned politicians know that the time span in which Americans focus their attention on non-American matters is very short, that admitting defeat in Ukraine would likely have little or no immediate consequences.
2561	35	However, the effects of repeated strategic failures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria are cumulative. In the 1980s, General Motors wanted to tell Americans what cars to buy, but American consumers had a different opinion. Therefore, GM, which dominated the American market for 77 years, lost its position to Toyota. Washington cannot impose all the consequences, nor can it escape responsibility for its wasteful spending and the ruination of American prosperity.
2561	37	Americans go to the polls in November. The electorate itself will do more than test the American electoral system. The election is also likely to make Biden remembered for his inability to compromise, for refusing to change course, much like Herbert Hoover in 1932. Democrats will remember that their predecessors in the Democratic Party successfully fought Hoover for more than half a century. Republicans can fight with Joe Biden for the next 50 years.
2561	38	A word of explanation from the translator
2561	40	"A word of explanation - The last two sentences are understandable to people interested in the internal politics of the United States. Herbert Hoover, a Republican, won the 1928 election and then lost decisively to F.D. Roosevelt in 1932. He is remembered as the president of the Great Depression who failed him, and despite the many positive aspects of his presidency, his tenure is generally perceived as a failure. In turn, ""50 years"" may mean the advantage of Democrats in the USA until Ronald Reagan, despite the fact that there were Republican presidents at that time, but, like Eisenhower, they were basically only GOP candidates, or discredited like Nixon. The author suggests that Biden's tenure will similarly be remembered as a failure, and that Republicans will find it easier to win for the next 50 years."
2564	1	Grzegorz Braun and scientists for peace in Ukraine
2564	3	As a national-radical milieu, we have our position on the war in Ukraine (see HERE), but we also present other views, because this is the mission of the Nacjonalista.pl portal since 2005. Below is a statement read out in the Sejm by MP Grzegorz Braun.
2564	5	The people and organizations gathered here call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine and for a compromise between Russia and Ukraine that will lead to a lasting peace. War is the greatest human and cultural tragedy. People die on both sides every day: they take with them their dreams and the personal potential they represent. This is a great human tragedy. War involves degeneration. During its duration, acts of cruelty and war crimes occur. War teaches us enmity and hatred. It degenerates us as people. In the name of defending life and our humanity, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine should be stopped immediately.
2564	7	The current war, in which NATO countries are involved, supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, including offensive ones, is the most dangerous armed conflict since the Second World War. It is a great threat to the economic situation of the world and to world peace. The population of many countries is now threatened with famine due to a decrease in grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the world is experiencing a sharp increase in the price of fuels produced by Russia. As a consequence, we are facing a global economic crisis with unimaginable consequences. It will be an even greater tragedy if the current war spirals out of control and turns from a local conflict into a continental war or another world war. This will mean hundreds of millions of victims, the destruction of states and the collapse of all our civilizational achievements.
2564	9	We believe that for peace and conflict resolution, it is necessary to understand its causes. The basic factor that is often the cause of wars is fear. In this case, it is Russia's fear of NATO expansion and the fear of neighboring countries of Russia's power. Therefore, in order to resolve the conflict, mutual fear must be removed, and only professional diplomacy and readiness to compromise can lead to this, and not military actions. Another reason for the current war, which is less talked about, is the introduction of changes in the language law in Ukraine, discriminating against the Russian linguistic minority. This led to the referendum in Crimea and the war in Donbass. The current war is therefore also a consequence of inappropriate internal policy. It leads to a great human tragedy and huge destruction. Matters are not resolved by war and dragging the whole world into it, but by talk and compromise. So we call for talks, compromise and peace.
2564	11	In the globalized world we live in, states are interdependent. Due to the global position of Russia and Ukraine, the consequences of the current war have a catastrophic impact on the entire world. It is not too late to resolve this conflict, which is very harmful and dangerous for all of us. We call for reason, for repentance and for peace.

2569	3	If someone was able to fight high prices, take inflation and reduce it to zero, it was my government - said Donald Tusk, the chairman of the Civic Platform party, on Saturday during the party's convention.
2569	5	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and hot and cold tap water, said Donald Tusk, the leader of the PO, at the PO convention. Meanwhile, if PiS continues to govern, bread may cost as much as PLN 30 at the end of the year, he added.
2569	7	"On Saturday, the ""Convention of the Future"" of the Civic Platform took place in the sports and entertainment hall of the Radom Sports Center. According to the organizers, there were almost 6,000 people. people. The podium from which PO politicians spoke was placed in the middle of the room, like a boxing ring. It was also a reference to the first PO convention in 2001, when the then PO leaders Donald Tusk, Andrzej Olechowski and Maciej Płażyński stood on a similar ""platform""."
2569	9	"The first to speak was the President of the Platform, Donald Tusk, who spoke for over 40 minutes. ""It is no coincidence that it is you, and not someone else, who show Poland where there is strength, where there is good will, where there is hope for change,"" Tusk said to the gathered."
2569	11	"In his speech, he referred to the one-year re-management of the Platform. He stressed that in recent months he has visited nearly 100 towns. ""On this road, I have met people who, like you, and almost all of Poland today, are very concerned with what is happening in our homeland. They are sometimes even broken by the experiences that fall on them, and at the same time hope and faith that this situation can be changed."
2569	13	"Tusk added that he had invited the hosts of some of his meetings to the convention. ""These are not people involved in political activities. They were the ones who wanted to talk to me, although, as you may know, it's not always easy,"" he noted. ""Today we live in a country where you need to have personal courage to speak publicly with the leader of the opposition,"" he said."
2569	15	"He said that thanks to the talks with farmers he understood why ""the Polish countryside today turns away from the rulers, why Polish farmers today feel cheated by the rulers"". ""Because they were deceived,"" he said. ""What does it mean to calculate and plan profitable production in a situation where artificial fertilizers have become more expensive by 700-800 percent over the course of a year, not to mention fuel"" - he added."
2569	17	"The PO leader also spoke about police officers. He stated that ""Polish policemen and Polish policemen go into service - almost all of them without exception - to defend Poles and chase bandits, not to defend the authorities against citizens."""
2569	19	"He described his meeting on Wiejska Street with the policemen who carefully looked around before turning to him. ""They say to me: Prime Minister, maybe you would finally put things in order, because we wanted to be in the police to chase bandits, and not stand for hours, days and weeks in front of the Sejm or on Nowogrodzka Street,"" Tusk said. He assessed that ""policemen are also, to a large extent, victims of this system that PiS has built in Poland - they really want to help us, not to disturb us."""
2569	21	"Tusk also drew attention to the situation of teachers. ""Today, we have older and older teachers in Polish schools - for obvious reasons. After all, this profession, which should be one of the most attractive - because we all respect and love our teachers - has probably become the most humiliating profession. the authorities in the same week when they gave themselves - ministers, president, prime minister - raises from 40 to 60 percent - at the same time told Polish teachers that they could get a 4 percent increase with an inflation of 16 percent."" he said. ""We will never forget this humiliation, this spitting in people's faces,"" declared the PO leader."
2569	23	"Giving examples of entrepreneurs running small businesses - bistro owners and a baker - he said that ""it is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy is starting to become critical""."
2569	25	"He cited forecasts according to which one third of restaurants in Poland may not survive until the end of the year. He referred to the IBRiS study, which showed that nearly 35% of families resigned from the planned leave; one-third of families had to reduce their food expenses, a similar percentage resigned from buying household appliances and audio/video devices. According to Tusk, ""it is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy is beginning to become critical."""
2569	27	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and hot and cold tap water, Tusk said. Meanwhile, if PiS continues to rule, then - here he referred to experts - a loaf of bread will cost PLN 10 or even PLN 30 at the end of the year.
2569	29	What happened that for seven years they turned Poland, a truly thriving country, the pride of Europe, into a country where water and bread become a problem? - He was asking.
2569	31	What are the real sources of this high PiS prices, this inflation, which in Poland is already record-breaking in Europe? Why does it have to be the most expensive with us? The reason for PiS's high prices is greed and stupidity, Tusk said.
2569	33	"He argued that one of the biggest pro-inflationary impulses is ""a legion of PiS activists who have invaded state-owned companies and are milking the state without remorse."" ""PiS will end, high prices will end"" - he said."
2569	35	"He accused NBP president Adam Glapiński of incompetence and inability to predict, recalling his statements from less than two years ago about deflation as a threat and the ""alleged threat of an explosion of inflation""."
2569	37	"He recalled that in November last year the head of the central bank announced a decline in inflation, and he said it ""almost on the same day when Prime Minister Morawiecki spent millions of zlotys on bonds that were supposed to protect his private savings against inflation."""
2569	39	"He assumed that inflation would be gigantic, but he did not tell the Poles that. Quietly, in secret from the citizens, the rulers secured themselves a lot of money - said the PO chairman. ""Thieves!"" the crowd chanted."
2569	41	"The leader of the Civic Platform also announced that if PO wins the elections, he will ""take Glapiński out of the NBP"". ""Adam Glapiński is not only incompetent, not only indecent in what he does. Adam Glapiński is also illegal. He will not be the president of the NBP for a day longer. There will be no need for a law"" - argued the Leader of the Platform."
2569	43	"He reminded that legal obstacles related to the re-election of Glapiński for a second term in the National Bank of Poland were pointed out by experts from the Chancellery of the President. ""A much smaller doubt would be enough to lead the guest out of the NBP. And I will do it, I guarantee it to you,"" Tusk assured. Pursuant to the Act on the National Bank of Poland, a member of the NBP Management Board may not serve more than two terms of office. Before the election of Adam Glapiński for the second term of office as the head of the NBP, it was argued that he had already completed his two terms of office in the Bank's authorities, because in 2016 he had already been a member of the NBP for several months."
2569	45	"During his speech, he thanked everyone who was involved in, among others, in the Committee for the Defense of Democracy, they took to the streets. ""Thanks to you, the faith has survived that it is worth setting up your own committees and chasing arrogant authorities by organizing and organizing all people of good will,"" he pointed out."
2569	47	He recalled Jacek Kuroń's slogan: do not burn committees, set up your own, referring to the burning of the building of the Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in Radom in June 1976.
2569	49	"He also noted that it is in Radom that he can say that when he compares the image of Radom in 1976 and today's Poland, ""this image is so similar that it can lead to despair."""
2569	51	"He argued that PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński is ""a representative of power who mocks, humiliates, and despises people, often children, who need special tenderness."" He pointed to ""Kaczyński's cackle, this mockery of Kaczyński and people in power over the disabled."" ""Do you remember that press conference on the street because the disabled were not allowed to enter the Sejm? PiS told them: get out! The Sejm is for us, and you can organize in the street,"" he addressed the participants of the convention."
2569	53	We are also here so that the authorities will never again despise the weaker people, he said.
2569	55	"At the same time, he said: ""The moment will come when we will all organize ourselves in the street, if this power does not disappear."""
2569	57	"Referring to the rights of the weakest, ""those who need help, or at least understanding and respect,"" he said, ""there is zero tolerance and zero mercy for those who seek some rotten compromises here."" He announced that the program of the ""breaking with hypocrisy, with this hypocrisy, e.g. with this commission that investigates pedophilia."""
2569	59	As soon as we take power, as soon as we win the elections (…) it will not be the case that whether it is a politician, the Marshal of the Sejm, a bishop, a minister, a high official ... It will not be the case that in cases of child abuse, pedophilia, violence against children, they will some sacred untouchable cows, he said.
2569	61	They will no longer be sacred, untouchable cows. Only children in Poland are sacred and untouchable, he stressed.
2569	63	"The leader of the Civic Platform also reminded that he is a father and grandfather. ""And I turn to fathers and grandparents: if you have a daughter or granddaughter like me, you cannot vote for PiS for the love of God,"" Tusk stressed. ""They really gave hell to women and they will give hell to your daughters and your granddaughters,"" he added."
2569	65	"He argued that he was the addressee of many requests or alarms about what was happening in Polish homes because the current ruling team had no idea about life. ""I'm sorry to be brutal, but do you gentlemen: Kaczyński, Rydzyk, Jędraszewski, what do they know, for the love of God, about motherhood, fatherhood, family, sex, bed?"" Tusk asked, to which the hall reacted enthusiastically with thunderous applause."
2569	67	"He appealed to fathers and grandfathers to ""talk"" to their daughters and grandchildren. ""Really, they will tell you everything, coffee on the table"" - he encouraged. ""And I also say this as a Christian. People, if someone believes in God, feels like a Christian, he can vote for a party that has Mejza, Kurski ... What are we even talking about?"" - the head of the Platform was surprised."
2569	69	"Listen, can you vote for lies, theft, contempt, hatred? - He was asking. ""You believe in God, you don't vote for PiS, it's as simple as pie,"" he added."
2571	1	Grzegorz Braun about life and family - answers to questions to presidential candidates
2571	3	The candidate for president, Grzegorz Braun, was the first to answer the questions asked by the PRO Foundation. Below we publish the letter sent to the editorial office of our portal in its entirety.
2571	5	Ladies and Gentlemen,
2571	7	"Thank you for your letter - it will be easier for me to answer the questions posed in it, since, in fact, I have already answered them many times. Several times I had the opportunity to speak publicly on topics that, like you, I consider to be crucial for the fate of the Polish nation and state, or more broadly, the entire Latin civilization. As the author of documentaries commonly perceived as an unequivocal voice for life, and against inhumane eugenic theories and criminal abortion practices - incidentally, often encountering aggressive criticism from anti-Polish and anti-Catholic propaganda centers - I have given, I believe, a sufficiently strong expression of my principled position. Therefore, I refer all those interested in my views to the films: ""Eugenics - in the name of progress"" and ""Not about Mary Wagner"", in which, I hope, I managed to include a sufficiently broad argumentation and exemplification relating to almost all of your issue. However, I understand that submitting my candidacy in the upcoming presidential election creates a new situation in which it is understandable to expect that opinions previously disseminated in various publications (apart from films, also press, radio, etc.) will now be collected and clearly repeated - which is also hereby I do (reserving the numbering of the questions given by you)."
2571	9	"1. So, do I think that Polish law should protect every human being from conception? Yes Sir. I definitely think so. At the same time, I understand that when you talk about ""protecting a person"", you mean the legal protection of every human life - regardless of age, health, property status, etc. Indeed, the law cannot make any exceptions to this rule, which would result from an arbitrary assessment of ""quality"" or the level of other people's expectations of human life. (I make an exception, of course, for adults who deliberately put themselves outside the law, and that is: premeditated killers, traitors to the state, spies and deserters in the face of the enemy - giving these criminals a legal guarantee of life is monstrous and absurd claim - for the use of such cases, I firmly postulate the restitution of the capital punishment)."
2571	11	"In particular, do I believe that children suspected of having a disease or genetic defect can be killed by abortion? No, by no means. In the film ""Not about Mary Wagner"" I presented, I believe, a sufficiently broad argumentation and exemplification explaining such a position. The very concept of evaluating the possible “imperfections” of our fellow human beings and judging on that basis who “deserves” to live is in fact a horrendous claim – and in practical terms it leads, as we know, to the slaughter of the innocent. Therefore, I reject any legal solutions that make such practices unpunished. Therefore, I reject, which is obvious, the so-called ""abortion compromise"". I would like to remind you that this is a legal state that places us at the level of solutions in force in the Third Reich, where the law also did not allow for the murder of every child with impunity - ""only"" some children (sic)."
2571	13	2. Do I believe that anyone has a right to possess another human being? No. I vehemently reject such a claim.
2571	15	"In particular, do I believe that anyone has the right to have a child and, consequently, to produce one by in vitro fertilization? No, nothing like that. In the film ""Eugenics - in the Name of Progress"" I tried to show that the moment of selection, which inevitably occurs in the ""in vitro"" procedure, makes the whole procedure criminal, and advertising it - especially perfidious and wicked. By the way, it is worth noting that the legal acceptance of the practice of ""in vitro"" deprives the logical basis for opposition to abortion - if we agree to selection in this particular phase of life, on what grounds should we question the right to carry out the same selection in other phases? And maybe this is the point - maybe, apart from the obvious interests of the ""in vitro"" industry, its promoters also want this: to introduce legal permission for abortion through the ""kitchen door"", so to speak?"
2571	17	"3. Do you think that marriage and the family should be especially protected? Yes, in did. I believe that the attitude towards life, marriage and family is generally one of the main criteria of value, legitimacy and effectiveness of every legal system, every state, every civilization. By the way: for this very reason, I question the legitimacy of the current government of Warsaw (which, to avoid possible confusion, I do not call it Polish). This government allows, even initiates further hostile acts against the Polish family - acting against the natural law, undermining parental authority, creating a guaranteed demand for the services of the ""in vitro"" industry, implementing the ""gender"" ideology into the Polish legal system, initiating disinformation and the depravity of minors by state compulsory education, etc. etc. The Warsaw state (which I do not call Polish) implements a strategy of perfidious aggression aimed at the family - also when it promotes legal acts such as the ""anti-violence convention"", the authors of which want to make the traditional family the main suspect and the culprit of all pathologies (by the way, not only against nature, but also against all true, statistically recognizable realities of social life in Poland)."
2571	19	"Do you allow marriage to be called a union other than the union of a man and a woman? No, I don't allow it. As a normal Pole, I reject with a shrug any arbitrary, absurd, ideologically motivated and politically enforced manipulation of the semantic fields of any words. And as a certified Polish philologist, I recall the long tradition of language manipulation to achieve propaganda goals by regimes fighting our civilization - modifying, and sometimes even reversing the meanings of words is the essence of every totalniac ""newspeak""."
2571	21	4. Do you think that the state can forcibly educate children against the values ​​of their parents? In particular, can a state school encourage promiscuity, encourage perverted sexual relationships, promote infertile drugs, and encourage abortion? Apparently it can - since that's what it commonly does. I, on the other hand, condemn this state of affairs in principle and very willingly criticize it. Some of you may be familiar with my critical attitude towards state-owned, centralized, compulsory education. For years, I have been trying not to miss the opportunity to criticize the Kołłątaj-Stalinist teaching system operating in our country. In this context, my radically negative attitude to any theories and pedagogical practices questioning parental authority is obvious. Nota bene: the fact described in historiography is the particular emphasis put on the principle of state education by Masonic lodges - researchers are familiar with periodically repeated proclamations and directives of French Freemasonry of the 19th and 20th centuries on this matter. – precisely because without state coercion, the other principles of these organizations fighting against the Catholic and Polish tradition could not be so effectively transmitted and implemented.
2571	23	Each of the above issues, of course, deserves a more serious discussion and calls for broader argumentation - which I will omit here, understanding that you are not lacking in arguments, but you want to know my clear position on these matters. I hope I am not leaving any room for fundamental doubts here. If they do, however, I'll provide further explanations. First of all, however, please kindly note that, beyond my own judgment, I would like to rely primarily on the Traditional Teaching of the Catholic Church in this matter (as in any other matter) - and this is the context in which any of my comments should be interpreted.
2571	25	"Finally, please accept my most sincere thanks for your commitment, for your courageous appearance in Polish public life - with my wishes that the matters you are striving for will finally find successful conclusions. What we will not be able to achieve, however, if the law in the Republic of Poland is still made by people who despise human life and are not afraid of God - with the passive participation of much more numerous ""supporters of compromise"". This is a page of disgrace which, in the face of the approaching 1050th anniversary of the Baptism of Poland, it is time to finally turn around."
2577	1	Nowacka: We agree, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks
2577	3	I can't imagine that my party colleagues would let go of something they put so much effort into. Donald Tusk was skeptical, but he saw the scale of women's protests and accepted the position prepared by PO MPs, believes Barbara Nowacka.
2577	5	You win the election and what happens to abortion?
2577	7	The law must be liberalized. Bills are ready.
2577	9	Is the line of the Civic Coalition consistent? Does not seem.
2577	11	Is. But just changing the law is not enough: we need to introduce sex education, accessible contraception and a social campaign showing the truth.
2577	13	Truth?
2577	15	Yes. Some PiS voters are against the changes, because they have been subjected to propaganda for years. We must show what a ban on abortion is and what liberalization means.
2577	17	And what is the truth about liberalization?
2577	19	Such that every Polish woman will be able to terminate her pregnancy up to the 12th week.
2577	21	And this is supposed to reassure PiS voters?
2577	23	It is worth at least making them aware that these choices are made anyway, only in the gray area. We need to show what dramas bad law leads to. If we don't show it, the power's idea to tighten the screw may come up again.
2577	25	You are talking about finished projects. which ones?
2577	27	There is, for example, the Let's Save Women project.
2577	29	Was. As a citizen who lost in the Sejm.
2577	31	Yes, I submitted it myself as a civic initiative. It's gone, but it physically exists. It is complete - it includes the issues of sex education and the availability of contraception, it contains solutions regulating the conscience clause. That is what KO proposes as part of the Pact for Women.
2577	33	You want to ban the clause?
2577	35	No, that's the right of doctors. But you have to take into account the right of patients: they need to know who they are going to. Today they don't know and it's a lottery. Which translates not only to the issue of abortion, but also access to contraception.
2577	37	In the light of the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal on the anti-abortion act, is this draft unconstitutional?
2577	39	It is neither a tribunal nor a sentence. The body that issued it cannot create the law and interpret it. He is burdened with original sin, which means that he can be considered non-existent.
2577	41	So the first step KO would like to take would be changes to TK?
2577	43	There would certainly have to be a major reform. Transitional provisions would be needed in order not to undermine the system. But yes, this is the concept, specialists are working on it. And then, de facto, we would automatically return to the reality of the previous regulations, including those regarding abortion.
2577	45	You haven't won the elections so far, so it's hard to talk about your project's chances. But you are in the Sejm, and the issue of abortion, instead of being liberalized, has been tightened. What now?
2577	47	What can be done without violating the pseudo-judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal is to remove the record on the criminality of doctors. The most important thing is that they refer for prenatal tests. So that they would not be afraid of having an abortion for the sake of the woman's mental well-being. So that they would not be afraid to make decisions about saving women.
2577	49	What if the Supreme Court deals with the issue of psychological well-being in the context of abortion and decides that this is not a prerequisite in accordance with the Act?
2577	51	We have no chance to counteract this with the current government. The obliging judge Ziobro will issue a verdict, and everything will be accepted by the parliamentary majority.
2577	53	Is abortion a politically winnable topic?
2577	55	This is not a political issue, but a social one.
2577	57	But it has become political. Politicians must decide what is profitable for them in this matter.
2577	59	It pays to create a situation where women are safe. And this can be guaranteed by giving them the right to decide how many, with whom and when they will have children.
2577	61	It's profitable? So what?
2577	63	I cannot talk about issues fundamental to women's lives and health in terms of support columns.
2577	65	But you are a politician.
2577	67	If I were a PiS politician, I would not wonder if it pays to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people. This is not a matter of political calculation, but a necessity. Saying the party has to look at the polls as an explanation...
2577	69	But KO seems to do that. Marshal Kidawa-Błońska said this month that abortion is evil. And Tusk argued that a compromise would be a problem for the PO.
2577	71	You can't win an election over abortion. But they can be lost when Polish women die because they did not have access to the procedure.
2577	73	Or when he goes the other way and says they can have an abortion on demand?
2577	75	"There is no such thing as ""abortion on demand"", just a woman's decision: easy, difficult or very difficult."
2577	77	Maybe KO politicians are afraid that the society is conservative and will lose by talking about abortion openly?
2577	79	It's not so conservative anymore. Women are changing, the climate in small towns is also changing. This was evident in the protests.
2577	81	And yet KO must constantly talk about its political line on this issue.
2577	83	No! All 4 parties agree that abortion should be allowed up to 12 weeks. PO and Nowoczesna are for an additional condition, i.e. consultation with a psychologist. We will talk about the details.
2577	85	You can talk for a long time. How can you be sure that KO will change the law?
2577	87	I can see that many of our MPs have changed their attitude after the Constitutional Tribunal's verdict. A social change is also visible, a gigantic shift towards pro choice - more and more people are in favor of the liberalization of the law. Politicians, including conservative ones, are influenced by their wives and daughters, who are more aware that this is their life. The parties have also changed.
2577	89	So if KO wins, it will be a change?
2577	91	I can't imagine that my party colleagues would let go of something they put so much effort into. Donald Tusk was skeptical at first. But he saw the scale of women's protests and accepted the position prepared by PO MPs. We can certainly cooperate with the Left on this matter. However, there is a big question mark when it comes to PSL and Poland 2050 by Szymon Hołownia. They will be difficult partners.
2577	93	In your opinion, nothing will change in this term of the Sejm?
2577	95	"On the topic of abortion? No. Members of the United Right are on a short leash with Kaczyński. In this context, it promises to be very interesting to vote on the civic project ""Stop Abortion"", which says, among other things, about 25 years in prison for abortion. Also for women. Ryszard Terlecki said at the conference that they would reject the draft in the first reading. But he immediately added that there would be no discipline. So we will see how many PiS politicians are able to express their own opinion."
2577	97	That is, to be precise: the ruling majority may vote for the motion to reject the draft in the first reading, which it will submit ...
2577	99	Civic Coalition, probably also the Left.
2577	101	"The civic project tightening the law went to the Sejm, and on the other side is the civic project ""Legal abortion without compromise"" still without the required 100,000. signatures."
2577	103	Please ask the committee that collects them.
2577	105	But you were involved in a twin project, Save the Women.
2577	107	I chaired this committee twice and there was no problem with collecting signatures twice. Though I must admit it's hard work. The one you are asking about concerns women politicians of the Left and women's organizations, and the Polish Initiative (chaired by Nowacka - ed.) has not been invited. The Women's Strike bet on the Left. But we support, for example in my parliamentary office, you can sign it.
2577	109	Is this your diplomatic answer to the question about the lack of unity of the opposition or left-wing circles on the subject of abortion?
2577	111	"When I was collecting signatures for ""Let's Save Women"", there was no political unity either. I invited everyone to this initiative, because I believe that what counts is the cause, not the party banner. I cannot say why such a strategy around ""Legal Abortion"" was adopted today. Why were signatures not collected during recent demonstrations? Why haven't we been talked to about this? The fact that when we collected signatures in 2016 and 2017 there was no pandemic, the social atmosphere was heated. It gave me confidence that it would work. Also slow down the changes. Because let's remember that we also fought against attempts to increase penalties for abortion. And then it worked."
2577	113	And today? After the verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal and the events in the district hospital in Pszczyna, the atmosphere is not hot?
2577	115	"Today we have an atmosphere of despair. We are not coming out with offensive slogans of liberalization of the law, but with a dramatic appeal: ""#NeitherOneMore"". The truth is also that submitting bills in today's Sejm does not make sense, because PiS has as an argument the aforementioned judgment of the pseudo-tribunal. And he will say this: we reject the project because it is unconstitutional."
2577	117	"During the collection of signatures for ""Let's save women"", there was a different parliamentary arithmetic?"
2577	119	No, it was just as difficult. But then, in addition to collecting signatures, we were doing a gigantic social campaign showing the truth, i.e. what the abortion law looks like, what does it mean access to safe, legal abortion, how important is sex education and effective contraception. And also what is the situation of women who go to the doctor, and in the office they hear that there is a conscience clause.
2577	121	Are you in favor of deleting Art. 152 of the Penal Code, which says about punishment for making or assisting in an abortion?
2577	123	Yes, including comes down to the so-called rescue act. He's talking about decriminalizing abortion.
2577	125	Today, from this article, accusations are made against activists of women's organizations.
2577	127	These activists help in crisis situations when the state systematically turns its back on women. In a moment everything will be read as aiding. If a girl comes up to me on the street and I give her the number of Abortion Without Borders, will I also have to expect charges? Assistance in making the decision to have an abortion, in providing information about possible ways, should not be punishable.
2577	129	And the doctors? How do you assess their attitude today? On the one hand, they say they are afraid of prosecution charges. On the other hand, we hear allegations about washing hands.
2577	131	You can't blame them for the fact that the state is run by fanatics. Their fear is not unfounded. Therefore, our idea for the current situation is to provide doctors with a sense of security.
2577	133	How?
2577	135	We are starting a series of meetings with local government officials. We want to take advantage of their good practices, e.g. of Warsaw and the decision of the mayor of the city right after the Constitutional Tribunal's verdict - so that hospitals operate, so that they do not cover themselves with the conscience clause. We also need to organize legal aid for doctors. In the field of interpretation of the current regulations, as well as in ad hoc situations - this is also a task for local governments.
2578	1	Is abortion a human right or not? It's not the point
2578	3	It doesn't really matter whether we consider the right to abortion to be a fundamental right or not. It is important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute a violation of women's rights.
2578	5	I worked for some time at the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights. I have handled three Polish cases assigned to me by lot concerning the relationship between the Act of 1993 on family planning, protection of the human fetus and the conditions for the admissibility of abortion and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms - which has been part of the Polish legal order since 1993.
2578	7	There were three cases: a complaint by Alicja Tysiąc, a complaint by R.R. and a complaint by P. and S. All resulted in judgments in which the tribunal found that the Polish authorities had violated the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in relation to the women complainants. The right to respect for private life was violated, and in the case of P. i. S. – also the prohibition of inhuman treatment. For the purposes of these cases, I have cut my professional teeth on studying the consequences of banning or restricting access to legal abortion for human rights - in the dimension of national law, in the perspective of comparative law and international law.
2578	9	That is why it is with some annoyance that I read some legal enunciations about abortion today - because of the carelessness of the authors, the superficiality of their texts or the hard ideologization of the subject, resistant to the rules of the legal craft, and often also to facts. An example from the last few days: an interview with my talented colleague, attorney Tomasz Snarski, published by the Catholic Information Agency. I understand that KAI needs expert legitimacy for the content it publishes on the legal aspects of abortion. However, I have a serious problem with what Attorney Snarski says as an expert.
2578	11	Women's human rights
2578	13	"By employing the trick of glamorously stating as a fact that ""abortion is not a human right,"" he manages to overlook - or distract the reader from - that the legal permissibility of abortion shapes and affects the human rights of which the woman is the subject."
2578	15	"We read in the interview that ""when it comes to ensuring the protection of the state for women who may find themselves in a situation of having to terminate their pregnancy, there is no need to refer to human rights."" We will not find in Snarski's words information about the relationship between the way in which the law determines the admissibility of abortion and the human rights of a woman. As if this relationship did not exist, and the right to terminate pregnancy was, as Snarski says, a gracious ""exception"" or ""concession"" of the legislator. (By the way, presenting the right to abortion in this way is unbearably cheesy and, from a comparative law perspective, inaccurate; for example, in Canada, after the 1988 Supreme Court repeal of a law criminalizing abortion on the grounds of its unconstitutional character, no legislation was enacted at the federal or in individual provinces, which defined the conditions for the admissibility of abortion)."
2578	17	The issue is not whether legal abortion is a human right or not. The point is that the fundamental right to respect for a woman's private life applies to assessing how the law regulates access to legal abortion (as well as other reproductive health services). This right is guaranteed to every person by Art. 47 of the Constitution, Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in force in Poland, or Art. 7 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights - that I will mention only the most important acts of national or international law. It should also not be forgotten that respect for private life and protection against state interference have been part of the European and Anglo-Saxon legal tradition for centuries.
2578	19	So Tomasz Snarski – or the journalist interviewing him – makes his task easier. It does not attempt to answer the question of what is the relationship between the respect for a woman's private life guaranteed by law and the competing right that the fetus might be entitled to.
2578	21	"In 2018, the then ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, said in the context of parliamentary work on two civic projects, which, in the intention of the authors, were to change the law on the conditions for admissibility of abortion, that ""abortion is not a human right."" The point was, however, that these conditions were determined by the national legislator, as international law does not directly guarantee the right to abortion. Not that the issue of abortion is indifferent to women's human rights, as attorney Snarski now claims."
2578	23	We know that such a relationship exists, for example, from the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. He noted long ago that abortion legislation affects the sphere of private life, because whenever a woman is pregnant her private life becomes closely linked with the developing foetus. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (guaranteeing the right to respect for private life) cannot, in the Court's view, be interpreted as conferring the right to abortion, but the factual situations resulting from the existence of prohibitions or restrictions on access are subject to assessment as to whether a woman's right to respect for her private life has not been infringed by these prohibitions.
2578	25	Thus, it makes no difference whether we consider the right to abortion to be a fundamental right or not. It is important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute a violation of women's rights. We will not find this information in the KAI interview.
2578	27	"""The principle of proportionality has not been adopted in Poland"""
2578	29	"Yes, there is mention of ""weighing certain values"". Meanwhile, we are dealing with a classic and often encountered in the practice of making and applying the law, a situation of competition worthy of protection of goods/values/rights."
2578	31	"The law has long known the means of settling such conflicts. Under Polish law, such an instrument is Art. 31 section 1 of the Constitution. It provides that ""restrictions on the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be established only by statute and only when they are necessary in a democratic state for its security or public order, or for the protection of the environment, health and public morals, or freedoms and the rights of others."" The principle of proportionality expressed in it, among others, is reflected in Article 32 of the European Charter of Human Rights and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights."
2578	33	A lawyer who respects the rules of the craft should not lose sight of this rule - as an instrument for resolving conflicts of goods/interests worthy of protection; as an instrument to achieve a fair balance between such goods. It also applies when it concerns a woman with an unwanted pregnancy, a pregnancy with a poor health prognosis for the woman herself and/or the fetus. It should at least mention it. It was the principle of proportionality that guided national legislators when, in the second half of the 20th century, they introduced laws in Europe and around the world legalizing abortion as a medical benefit.
2578	35	"It is not without reason that constitutionalists or human rights specialists sometimes bitterly say that ""the principle of proportionality has not been accepted in Poland"" as a professional instrument of subtle and precise weighing of competing goods and interests worthy of protection; as an instrument of seeking a just settlement; as a reflex of justice of people making and applying the law. The position presented by Attorney Snarski - that the right to life of the fetus must always and in every situation give way to any other right of a woman - is an expression of such disregard for the principle of proportionality. The radical character of this position is that it treats the fetus as a human being and abortion as taking a human life. However, we do not find out what exactly the ""search for optimal solutions in non-optimal conditions"" postulated by the lawyer would consist of - in terms of determining the legal admissibility of abortion. We also do not learn that the law may - and does - differentiate the scope of legal protection of the fetus depending on the stage of pregnancy development."
2578	37	"Speaking of these values ​​and interests, it is impossible not to notice that in the text devoted, inter alia, to the issue of the legal regulation of abortion, there is not a single sentence about what values ​​and interests of a woman worthy of legal protection are in favor of abortion. pregnancy was an available and legal medical benefit. Yes, we have a journalist's suggestion that such a good could be ""unlimited freedom for a woman"", to which Attorney Snarski replies with some indignation that there is no such thing as unlimited freedom - and rightly so."
2578	39	"It's just that, apart from ""unlimited freedom"", there are also other interests and goods of women that the ban on abortion may violate or annihilate. For example, personal autonomy. For example, the desire to shape one's own destiny in the intended way. For example, a sense of responsibility for the fate of children you already have. For example, the awareness that the birth of a sick child - statistically speaking - results in the fact that about 80 percent of men leave the family. But who would care about such whims. It's easier to just call them ""unlimited freedom."""
2578	41	Is the fetus subject to legal protection to the same extent as a human being?
2578	43	"Therefore, we do not find in the text information that the legal regulation of abortion has a direct impact on whether women's rights are observed and respected. Instead, we can read that “from the perspective of the concept of human rights that I share, the right to abortion is simply incomprehensible. It is difficult to understand how someone could have this right, understood as a human right. Because the consequence would be to say that the fetus, that is, the human before birth, is not a separate person. Next, we read about the rights of ""innocent, defenseless people, such as unborn children."""
2578	45	"Mec. Snarski thus glides smoothly over the issue of the status of the fetus, treating it as a ""human before birth"". As if in a legal sense it was obvious obviousness. For the purposes of this text, there is of course no need or opportunity to refer to the extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether a fetus is a human being in the sense that it deserves the same scope of protection as after birth. Suffice it to recall that this issue has been and remains the subject of considerable debate and controversy. It would be elegant to even mention this, rather than presenting the matter as if the opinion of the speaker - to which he is of course entitled - were the same as the conclusion of this debate. Because it just isn't."
2578	47	"After all, in the Polish legal literature there is a fundamental work - awarded by the editors of the prestigious monthly ""State and Law"" for the best doctorate - on the definition of the beginning of human life, differences in this matter between different legal systems and differences in international law itself. Dr. Jelena Kondratiewa-Bryzik (worked at the Center for Human Rights of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznań, died in 2012 in a train crash near Szczekociny) published a book entitled ""The beginning of the legal protection of human life in the light of international standards"" in 2009. The author presented a careful comparative law analysis of the way in which various acts of international law and the jurisprudence developed on their basis define this moment. These definitions are very diverse and cannot be reduced to a simple conclusion that a fetus is simply a human being, who is therefore entitled to the same legal protection before and after birth."
2578	49	"It would also be worth remembering the position of the European Court of Human Rights on this issue. According to it, at the European level ""there is no consensus on the nature and status of the embryo and/or fetus (...), although they are beginning to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequences of genetic engineering research, medically assisted procreation or embryo experimentation. At best, it can be considered common ground between states that the embryo/fetus belongs to the human race. The potentiality of this entity and its capacity to become a person - which enjoys civil law protection in many countries, such as France, in the context of inheritance and gifts, and in the United Kingdom ... - needs to be protected in the name of human dignity, without making a “person” having a “right to life” within the meaning of Article 2 of the [European Convention on Human Rights]'. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court is convinced that it is neither desirable nor even possible, as things stand, to give an abstract answer to the question of whether an unborn child is a person within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. 2 of the Convention [which guarantees the right to legal protection of life]”."
2578	51	It would be worth bearing this in mind before formulating a judgment on the legal status of the fetus as categorical as that of Attorney Snarski, and in addition - a judgment which, in the context of the interview, can be perceived as an expert, legal statement of facts. For those practicing the legal profession, the ability to distinguish between facts and judgments/evaluations is part of the basic professional toolkit. I have no doubt that Mr. Snarski possesses this skill, which his professional achievements are a convincing proof of. The credibility of his position would be enhanced if he avoided this awkwardness.
2578	53	It will not be out of place here to refer to the important professional success of Attorney Snarski. He represented the families of the victims of the Smolensk catastrophe before the European Court of Human Rights. The complaint concerned a violation of the right to respect for private and family life as a result of the exhumation of the victims' remains against the families' objections. The Strasbourg Court ruled that the exhumation constituted such a violation. Just as the Convention does not directly guarantee the “right to abortion”, it does not guarantee “the right not to exhume the bodies of relatives without the consent of the family”. But both are equally subject to evaluation: whether it was compatible with human rights.
2578	55	"Shooting acts to ""inherent human dignity"" are no longer enough"
2578	57	It is with great sadness that I make this last remark. I have no doubts about the sincere commitment of Dr. Snarski in the idea of ​​protecting human rights. However, the interview contains a significant omission. It has, in my opinion, the value of ethical omission.
2578	59	Today, in Poland, it is impossible to talk about the legal permissibility of termination of pregnancy, having swallowed water in the mouth as to the consequences of the ban on abortion due to fetal pathology. There are already two stories of young pregnant women who died in hospitals after the tribunal of Julia Przyłębska removed the embryopathological premise from the 1993 act. I expect from lawyers - and I consider it an important element of professional craft, which is often absent in Polish jurisprudence, which sometimes sins with theoretical beauty - the willingness and ability to reflect on the social consequences of the law in force.
2578	61	"And I expect from human rights lawyers that they are willing and able to see the real consequences of the applicable legal norms for the lives of real people. That they are not satisfied with soaring acts to ""inherent human dignity"", which in the face of the horror of today's situation of Polish women sound like copper."
2579	1	Kataryna: Why should abortion be morally neutral?
2579	3	"Girls to Girls: “The text »I support, but I would never have an abortion myself« emphasizes that abortions are something bad, something that should be avoided, something that should be as little as possible. What do you really mean by saying this sentence? Isn't it about protecting yourself from being judged by others?"""
2579	5	"The fight of pro-abortion circles - because calling them pro-choice has long since become obsolete - for the legalization of abortion quickly moved from the stage ""no one says that abortion is not good"" to the stage ""let no one say that abortion is wrong"". Now they force abstaining from moral evaluations of abortion, regardless of what was the reason for it and at what point in the pregnancy it was carried out. It is supposed to be morally neutral, even if the pregnancy is so advanced that the child is able to live independently outside the mother's body. After all, it is still a fetus and the right to talk about it as stuffing for dumplings will be defended by the progressive left as independence."
2579	7	"Representatives of the Abortion Dream Team write that ""abortion is one of the methods of fertility control, as important as contraception, and there is no reason for politicians, medicine or the market to dictate to us what is the better way to protect against unwanted pregnancy"". the right to abortion in certain circumstances, but have the audacity to say that they would not have an abortion themselves, the right to consider themselves pro-choice is being denied, because today pro-choice is no longer a fight for the right to abortion, it is a fight for the prohibition of its moral After all, it's just contraception, just as morally neutral as condoms. Thus, abortion lobbyists confirm exactly what they have been - allegedly unfairly - criticized for. Abortion for them is like cutting a fingernail. And it's not about changing the law, it's about permanently gagging It's good that we have clarity."
2579	9	"Do you know how the taboo of women smoking in public was broken in America? An advertising agency working for cigarette manufacturers organized a ""spontaneous"" women's march called the Torches of Liberty on Easter 1929. Proudly, they walked down Fifth Avenue in New York, convinced by greedy millionaires that they were fighting for their freedom, when in fact they fought for (and won) multiplication of profits Tobacco corporations have won for themselves only that today lung cancer is the second most malignant cancer in women, after breast cancer. an organization working for the right to abortion in countries where it is banned - they charge 70-90 euros for an abortion pill ""donations"". It's a potentially gigantic market if you manage to break the taboo completely."
2583	1	Pro-life voice: religious, philosophical, legal, biological and social arguments against abortion
2583	3	"Abortion has been one of the most divisive social problems for many years. Everyone speaks about it - from religious institutions, through biologists and ethicists, to philosophers. Often, however, the opinions expressed lack argumentation that could appeal to the average citizen. Nothing comes of such empty words. In the following article, we will present the reasons why abortion - especially ""on demand"" - should be stigmatized. First, some definitional issues need to be clarified. Since there is no medical term that unambiguously refers to all stages of the body's development between conception and birth, for the purposes of the following text, let's assume that we will use the terms ""fetus"" and ""[unborn] child interchangeably in this context, unless it does not follow otherwise."
2583	5	What is pro-life?
2583	7	The supporters of the restrictive abortion law are referred to as pro-life. Although in the popular opinion they are in favor of a complete ban on abortion, in reality this environment is not homogeneous. Some of the pro-life movement allow termination of pregnancy in special cases (e.g. when the life of the mother is in danger), while others are even against artificial methods of birth control (e.g. hormonal contraception). It is much safer to say that the general goal of this community is not to make abortion illegal, but to minimize the frequency of abortions. This can be achieved both by tightening the law (if the current one seems too liberal) and by maintaining the status quo (eg if the government is trying to liberalize existing provisions). Pro-life does not want to allow for a situation of social consent to abortion, which in consequence could turn into further and uncontrolled shifting of the border of deciding about human life or death.
2583	9	I. Religious authorities agree
2583	11	"In Poland, about 94% of citizens are Roman Catholics (according to the publication of the Central Statistical Office ""Religious denominations in Poland 2012-2014""). Of course, this does not mean, as some people think, that the other 6% must blindly submit to the morality imposed by the majority. However, since so many of us accept the teachings of the Church, it is worth finding out what the holy books and people we consider authorities think about abortion."
2583	13	Decalogue and Catechism of the Catholic Church
2583	15	"You do not have to look far, because the Decalogue already says directly: do not kill. The fifth commandment protects the life of every human being from conception to natural death, hence the position of Catholics is unchanging and clear - both on the issue of abortion and euthanasia. However, as we know (or at least we should know), biblical records are not always to be taken literally. So let's refer to the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church"" - the official interpretation of the doctrine of faith and moral principles of the Church, written in a simple language understandable to everyone and published in 1992. It is therefore a relatively new document and approved by the then Pope, John Paul II. The aforementioned fifth commandment of the Decalogue is developed here in nearly 80 points, but only six of them are of particular interest to us: points 2270 to 2275 specifically deal with the issue of abortion. So how does the ""Catechism"" address this issue? Already at point 2270 we get a clear and exhaustive answer:"
2583	17	Human life should be respected and protected in an absolute way from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being should be granted the rights of a person, among them the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.
2583	19	Further points develop this thesis: From the beginning, the Church has held that it is morally wrong to terminate a pregnancy by any means. The teaching on this subject has not changed and remains unchanged. Direct abortion, that is, willed as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law (2271). The Catechism refers to on Didache, one of the oldest Christian texts: Thou shalt not kill a fetus by abortion, nor kill a newborn (Didache 2:2).
2583	21	Formal cooperation in abortion is a serious offence. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. Anyone who procures an abortion, after having obtained its effect, is excommunicated by the law itself, by the mere fact of committing the crime, under the conditions provided by law (2272). The inalienable right to life of every innocent human being is a constitutive element of civil society and its legislation: The inalienable rights of the person shall be recognized and respected by civil society and political authority. (…) Among these fundamental rights are (…) the right to life and physical integrity of every human being from the moment of conception until death. (…) As an expression of the respect and care due to the child to be born, from the moment of its conception, the legislation should provide for appropriate penal sanctions for any voluntary violation of its rights (2273). Some homegrown critics of the anti-abortion law claim that Roman Catholic doctrine does not allow absolutely any intervention during pregnancy, including, among others, abortion. prenatal testing. This is, of course, utter nonsense, as the last two points say: Since the embryo should be considered a person from the moment of conception, its integrity should be defended, cared for and treated as much as possible like any other human being. Prenatal diagnosis is morally permissible if it “respects the life and integrity of the human embryo and fetus, seeks to protect or treat it individually (…) It is against the moral law when, depending on the results, it leads to termination of pregnancy. Diagnostics should not result in a death sentence (2274). Like any medical procedure on a patient, procedures on the human embryo should be considered acceptable provided that they respect the life and integrity of the embryo without exposing it to disproportionately great risks; when they are taken to treat, improve his health or to save a life in danger (2275).
2583	23	"So what are the conclusions from reading the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church""? human life is protected from the moment of conception, abortion is unquestionably wrong and immoral, prenatal examinations and procedures on embryos are absolutely permitted, as long as they do not endanger the life of the mother and child."
2583	25	Mother Teresa and John Paul II
2583	27	Mother Teresa of Calcutta, one of the most influential figures in the history of world peace, was also very critical of abortion. An excerpt from her 1979 Nobel Peace Prize speech is often quoted: The greatest threat to peace today is abortion. If a mother is allowed to kill her own child, what's to stop you and me from killing each other? Unborn children are the poorest of the poorest. Finally, let us return to John Paul II. Three years after approving the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Pope published Evangelium Vitae, an encyclical on the value and inviolability of human life. In it, he condemned abortion as a cruel crime:
2583	29	All kinds of homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, and voluntary suicide… all these and similar things and practices are shameful; by infecting human civilization, they dishonor those who commit them more than those who are harmed, and they are most contrary to the honor due to the Creator.
2583	31	"John Paul II also said that in the case of an inherently unjust law, which is the law that allows abortion and euthanasia, one must never comply with it ""nor participate in shaping public opinion favorable to such a law, or show support for it by voting"". It is worth noting that many Catholics treat the teachings of the Church very selectively, treating them as an excuse only on very specific issues. This is not what true faith is about. By giving the opinion of religious authorities only when it fits our beliefs, we distort the idea of ​​religion. The position of the Church is and has always been clear: abortion is an absolute and ruthless evil."
2583	33	Abortion in other religions
2583	35	What about the other six percent that are not covered by this interpretation? Other religions are also critical of abortion.
2583	37	Different branches of Christianity
2583	39	Orthodoxy, like Catholicism, shares the view that human life begins at conception. Abortion is therefore treated as murder. Many Protestant denominations, mainly Orthodox, hold a similar opinion. The largest Protestant Church in Poland, the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland, in a statement from 1991 strongly advocated the protection of life from the moment of conception and opposed the use of early-term abortion pills. Churches associated in the Evangelical Alliance are also against abortion. The Southern Baptist Convention is an outright opponent of abortion.
2583	41	Jehovah's Witnesses are against abortion: God considers life sacred. He already sees the embryo as a separate human being. King David was inspired to write about God: “Your eyes have even seen my embryo.”​—Psalm 139:16. At one time, God declared that anyone who harms an unborn child will be held accountable. Thus, in God's eyes, killing such a child is murder (Exodus 20:13; 21:22, 23).
2583	43	Buddhism
2583	45	Although Buddhism does not have an official interpretation on abortion, many monastic codes - referring to traditional scriptures - recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life. For this reason, abortion, as a conscious destruction of this life, is treated as something wrong. Theravada and Vajrayana monks are disfellowshipped for assisting in abortions. The current Dalai Lama also advocates a negative view of abortion, saying that it is an act of murder, so according to the teachings it should be stigmatized. It is also worth mentioning that traditional Buddhist scriptures do not differ in the approach to early and late abortion - each case is associated with negative moral or karmic consequences.
2583	47	Hinduism
2583	49	"Traditional Hindu texts condemn abortion. This crime is treated, depending on the sources, on a par with breaking the vow of chastity (Mahanarajana Upanishad), as worse than killing one's own parents (Kaushitaki Upanishad), and even equal to killing a brahmin priest (which in Hinduism is one of the heaviest crimes if not the heaviest). A woman who has an abortion risks losing her caste status. The abortion itself is called bhrūṇahatya (fetal murder), and the person who performs it is called bhrūnahan (killer of a learned brahmin). In Hinduism, life begins at conception. Abortion therefore causes the death of a person, and this violates the principle of faith, ahimsa (the term literally means ""non-harming"")."
2583	51	Religions say a firm 'no' to abortion
2583	53	Most major religions therefore have a clear and negative stance on abortion. Human life begins at conception, so any interference that causes the death of an embryo or fetus is reprehensible in one way or another. It is worth noting that in most cases the murder of an unborn child is treated at least on an equal footing - and sometimes even as a more serious crime - than the murder of a born person. Of course, as noted earlier, we absolutely should not impose the morality of our religion on others, but if we profess a given faith, we should live according to its guidelines - and those regarding abortion are usually clear.
2583	55	II. The law protects the fetus
2583	57	The issue of abortion is not top-down regulated by EU law, so it remains within the competence of the member states.
2583	59	Constitution of the Republic of Poland
2583	61	The Constitution of the Republic of Poland of April 2, 1997 reads: The Republic of Poland provides every person with legal protection of life (Article 38) and Everyone is equal before the law (Article 32(1)). So it remains only to define the moment when a man is created. The Constitution does not answer this question (mainly because it is a general act), but the Constitutional Tribunal does. In the decision of May 28, 1997 (reference number K 26/96) we read:
2583	63	The value of the constitutionally protected legal good, which is human life, including life developing in the prenatal phase, cannot be differentiated. There are no sufficiently precise and justified criteria to make such a differentiation depending on the stage of development of human life. From the moment of its creation, human life becomes a constitutionally protected value. This also applies to the prenatal phase.
2583	65	This position was also upheld 7 years later (judgment of 7 January 2004, reference number K 14/03): All possible doubts as to the protection of human life should be resolved in favor of this protection (in dubio pro vita humana). This means that human life - a clear analogy to religious interpretations can be noticed - begins from the moment of conception, and if it is not known whether a given action (here: abortion) interferes with the protection of this life, it should be assumed that it is.
2583	67	Convention on the Rights of the Child
2583	69	And if the Polish interpretation - according to pro-choice circles contaminated with Catholic thinking - is not enough, let's reach for a much wider document: the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This agreement was ratified by Poland as early as 1991, and what is more, it was Poland that proposed the UN Human Rights Commission to adopt it and presented the draft. In its provisions, the Convention repeats the postulate of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child adopted in 1959: The child, due to his physical and mental immaturity, requires special care and attention, including appropriate legal protection, both before and after birth. The last fragment is important because it also grants the aforementioned rights to the child in the womb. The Convention does not clearly define when a child begins. Again, the principle of in dubio pro vita humana can be invoked - the provision on legal protection before birth is a sufficient condition to recognize that the organism is subject to this protection from the moment of conception, and not an imaginary point in time.
2583	71	III. Uncertain position of biologists
2583	73	"The biological point of view has one fundamental flaw: even pro-abortionists admit that it is impossible to clearly determine at what point in development we are dealing with a human being. Therefore, they resort to such abstract concepts as identifying humanity with consciousness, with independence from the mother's body, with the feeling of pain, or they simply set a certain arbitrary age of the fetus, beyond which we have full rights to life, and before it - no rights. This type of argumentation is not only ridiculous, but also ignorantly selective - which will be discussed in more detail in the section devoted to philosophical issues. So let's leave this argument unproven for the moment. Let's turn off emotions, turn on thinking and approach the matter rationally. In a simplification, we can assume - regardless of our views on the issue of abortion - that every living being is a set of genes, and a set of very strictly defined ones. A human being (again, for the sake of simplicity, we omit, for example, genetic diseases as irrelevant to the evidence) has 46 chromosomes - 23 from the father and 23 from the mother. Since human reproductive cells can only come into contact with other human reproductive cells (despite ambitious attempts, scientists have failed to fertilize even the closest biological relatives of Homo sapiens), it is obvious that an organism formed by the interaction of male and female human gametes and possessing 46 chromosomes make a human. An 80-year-old man has 46 chromosomes. An 18-year-old boy has 46 chromosomes. A newborn baby has 46 chromosomes. A three-month-old fetus has 46 chromosomes. So the question should be asked: how many chromosomes does the newly formed embryo have? Of course, we all know the answer. There are 46 of them - already at the moment of union, the zygote has a full set of chromosomes. At the DNA level, even the zygote - and even more so the embryo and fetus - are creations on a par with an adult individual. If it is wrong to kill the latter, then why is it justified to kill its earlier form? The scientific, not the emotional, approach to biology thus confirms both religious and legal arguments. We are de facto human at conception. Not after birth, not as a fetus, not as an embryo, but after conception. Therefore, under the applicable law, we are entitled to the same protection as an adult. Another argument cited by the pro-choice community is that the fetus or embryo is an integral part of the mother's organism, because it develops inside her and is connected to her by the umbilical cord. You couldn't be further from the truth. A child is an absolutely separate being - it has separate organs (when they are created), often a different blood type, and above all - and here we return to the scientific essence of humanity - a different genetic code. Two different DNA codes always result in two separate organisms. It is even more absurd to invoke the ""existential dependence of the fetus on the mother"" and the symbiotic relationship. The weaker Siamese twin may be existentially dependent. Does this give the stronger twin the right – as the one who “mothers” in a way – to decide the fate of the weaker one? So why do we let the mother do this?"
2583	75	IV. Society less and less favorable to abortion
2583	77	Since the introduction of the 1993 Act, the attitudes of Poles have become increasingly conservative. In 2006, for the first time, the advantage of abortion opponents over supporters was noted. Even in 2009, every third Pole allowed for the possibility of termination of pregnancy. Four years later - only every fourth. The trend of moving away from abortion on demand from year to year is more and more clearly visible.
2583	79	"The CBOS communiqué ""Abortion in various situations"" from May 2016 clearly indicates that Poles are against killing unborn children. As many as 65% of respondents believe that the mother's minor age is not an argument for abortion. Only every fifth Pole has a different opinion. There is even less social acceptance for abortion due to a difficult personal situation (80% against) or financial situation (81% against)."
2583	81	Interestingly, household income per capita does not significantly differentiate opinions on abortion due to poor financial situation. People with an income of PLN 649 or less per capita are 80% against abortion in such a case, and people with an income of PLN 1,000-1,399 – in 84%. This gives the lie to the statement that the greatest opposition is expressed by those who cannot be directly affected by this situation. Respondents with lower income also speak negatively about abortion among people with a similar financial status. As reported in the Communication: 54% of people strongly oppose the admissibility of abortion in a situation where a woman simply does not want to have a child. In total, 12% of Poles declare that abortion should then be allowed, and 78% are of the opposite opinion. Opinions on abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy are similar (without indicating the reason). Three quarters of the respondents (74%) believe that termination of pregnancy should not be allowed, and 13% are willing to accept it.
2583	83	It is therefore clear that over the years Polish society has matured and gained awareness. The number of opponents of abortion is systematically growing. In the common opinion, this is a morally reprehensible phenomenon, for which there is no public consent. We live in a democratic country, and this implies two important issues: respect for decisions made by the majority (since the vast majority treat abortion as evil - like any other murder - directed against another human being, this should be reflected in the law); respecting the rights of the weaker party (in this case, the weaker party is the unborn children who must be protected).
2583	85	Social pathologies resulting from the legalization of abortion
2583	87	"Society is opposed to abortion on demand because it perpetuates pathological patterns of behavior. Treating a child as a commodity that must be free from blemishes (and yet the slightest physical or mental disability is already an argument for termination of pregnancy) directly leads to abortion for other reasons - inappropriate sex (in India selective abortion is already a fact), eye color , the presence of this or that recessive gene. If the unborn child does not fit our idealized image of a descendant, it is easier to ""scrape"" it than to have, for example, a red-haired son instead of a blonde-haired daughter. From here it is only a step to negative eugenics, an example of which we had in the first half of the 20th century right under our noses. By taking away our unborn child's right to life only because he will be born deaf or with Down's syndrome, do we not become, in a sense, the continuators of the German Action T4?"
2583	89	VI. Abortion and the demographic problem
2583	91	"It is assumed that generational replacement is possible when the fertility rate oscillates around 2.1. In Poland, we have been dealing with a demographic low for a long time - and not just any low. According to ""The World Factbook"" data for 2015, the fertility rate in Poland was only 1.33 - it was the 215th result in the world out of 224 countries. This means that from generation to generation the population of Poles is decreasing by one third. The implications of a low fertility rate are predictable and visible now. According to the report of the Central Statistical Office ""Population forecast for the years 2014-2050"": Lower fertility means a smaller number of children born, which in turn leads to a decrease in the percentage of young people in the population, which results in increasing social benefits for the elderly, worsening economic situation of young people and, as a result, a low fertility rate or its decline."
2583	93	This phenomenon is called the low fertility trap. Needless to say, one of the sources of this state of affairs is abortion. In 2014, according to the report of the Council of Ministers, nearly 1,000 such procedures were performed in Poland. Of course, this number only refers to legal cases, which are just the tip of the iceberg. Supporters of the pro-choice movement estimate the scale of the abortion underground at up to 200,000 abortions a year. This is more than half of the number of live births in 2014. If this procedure were limited to individual cases, the fertility rate would approach 2.0.
2583	95	Legalization (is not) a recipe for everything
2583	97	Of course, you can raise your voice that forbidden fruit tastes best (there is a very perverse joke lurking somewhere in this statement), and the best method of fighting the abortion underground - and thus low birth rate - is ... full legalization of abortion. One can refer to Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, which completely deregulated the state. But life is not as simple as some people make it out to be. Contrary to the belief of some circles, abortion is not a procedure of first necessity. It's a luxury. Erase - and again dark humor looks around the corner - the mistakes of the previous evening, week or month. Many aspects of life are forbidden by law, and yet we have not fallen into ruin. The streets are not full of drunk high school students (after all, alcohol is allowed from the age of 18), and there are no notorious heroin users in the stairwells. If the real source of all evil was the prohibition of doing it, each of us would have a moonshine brewery, an ammunition depot and a methamphetamine production camper. However, this is not the case. Allowing the sale of home-produced alcohol will not make people stop drinking. Legalizing abortion will not make the underground disappear.
2583	99	Does abortion protect against overpopulation?
2583	101	"The threat of overpopulation of the world, so eagerly cited by pro-choice circles, is also a myth. The global fertility rate is only ... 2.42 (according to ""The World Factbook""). It is true that in the 20th century we saw a huge jump in population - from 1.6 to over 6 billion - but today this growth is no longer exponential. It is estimated that in 2100 there will be ""only"" 11 billion of us, which is only 4 billion more than today. If living conditions in the poorest regions of the world - mainly in Africa - are improved, this ratio should fall further. After all, as many as 32 of the top 33 countries in the ranking are located on this continent - and the last of them, Madagascar, has an indicator twice as high as required for generational replacement. Improving the living conditions would certainly reduce it, as it would be associated with lower child mortality and longer life expectancy."
2583	103	VII. Post-abortion grief – do women feel remorse?
2583	105	"The monograph ""Abortion - between ideology and individual experience"" by Ewelina Wejbert-Wąsiewicz (recognized by the Polish Sociological Association as the best scientific book in the field of sociology in 2011) shows that this procedure has an undoubted impact - and a negative impact - on the later lives of would-bes parents. The book presents a list of reasons for abortion along with the degree of ""post-abortion regret"" resulting from it."
2583	107	It is clear that the vast majority of cases are accompanied by pathological grief - this means that abortion is not indifferent to women and causes heavier rather than lighter feelings. On the internet forum addressed to post-abortion women, on the basis of which the above table was created, one can see, among others, such statements (original spelling): (...) I cut my hands from despair and helplessness (...) my child... forgive me, I hope that I will fix it all... that God will help me... how could I fail like that... (...) I I killed... deserves to die (...) I want to have a child... give him this love... I would give my life for one more chance! The whole situation is not helped by the fact that in Poland there is a lack of good, professional psychological help and gynecological care. Thus, women's post-abortion suffering is even stronger than it could be if an adequate level of medical services was maintained (which does not imply, however, that lesser suffering justifies termination of pregnancy in some way). On the other hand, the monograph also mentions cases when women felt absolutely no guilt for the act they had committed. Abortion for them was almost a cosmetic procedure, like a peeling of exfoliating epidermis. If they got pregnant again, they would kill another fetus without batting an eyelid.
2583	109	If not abortion, then what?
2583	111	Foster family
2583	113	The first solution that comes to mind as an alternative to abortion is a foster family. It is said that this is a very difficult, complex and long procedure, but the report of the Intervention Pre-Adoption Center (March 2013) shows that as many as 97% of the charges went to the family environment - including over 91% to foster and natural families. The average length of stay in the IOP of a child left by its mother in the hospital is only 61 days. In a situation where every fifth married couple has problems with getting pregnant, accepting a child for adoption seems to solve several issues at the same time - it limits the scale of abortion, allows the child to live (who is not guilty of anything in itself) and enables it to be raised by people who for various reasons, they cannot have biological offspring.
2583	115	The window of life
2583	117	Mothers wishing to renounce their own child may be terrified of the disclosure of their data. In the hospital you have to sign the appropriate papers and expose yourself to the label (in this respect we are still stuck in the deep Middle Ages) of a degenerate mother. So if not open adoption, then maybe the so-called. windows of life? The window of life is a place where the mother can anonymously leave the baby - opened from the outside, heated, with adequate ventilation. Its opening activates a signal that informs the person on duty about the appearance of a child. Then it is enough to place them in an incubator, notify the hospital, conduct tests (and with them the procedures for granting identity and the adoption process) and wait for the interested family. Windows of life may not be a particularly common solution - according to the Opoka Foundation, from 2006 to 2013 they saved only 64 children - but after all, every life here is worth its weight in gold. Every child in the window of life is one less child in the cabbage barrel.
2583	119	Smart education
2583	121	"However, these are only - or even - ad hoc actions. As the paremia attributed to Hippocrates says, morbum evitare quam curare facilius est - prevention is better than cure. What's the best way to prevent an abortion? In the same way that can prevent unwanted pregnancies (and no, we still consider abortion as a method of contraception wrong): through proper sex education. It is an open secret - although very terrifying in 21st-century Europe - that the majority of unplanned conceptions result from ignorance of one's own body. Myths such as ""if I pull it out, you won't get pregnant"" or ""you can't get pregnant the first time"" - and even such implausible ""methods"" of contraception as jumping on one leg after intercourse to shake the sperm out of the body - are still present in the consciousness of society . This is due both to the treatment of sex as a taboo subject - especially in intergenerational relations - and to the inappropriate approach of the institutions that shape us during our school years. We gain sexual education in contacts with peers, on pornographic websites and in the section with letters to the editor of popular youth magazines. By creating a sensible educational program in schools, we have a much better chance of fertilizing the minds of youth before those youth will hastily inseminate each other's bodies. This, of course, requires effort - an effort incomparably greater than the statutory ban on abortion practices and the introduction of conscience clauses at every stage, from the gynecologist to the lady in the pharmacy - but if we want to have a healthy functioning state, this effort cannot be avoided."
2583	123	Awareness of your actions
2583	125	"Naturally, it would also be untrue to say that every abortion is a depravity in every respect. Certainly, sometimes there are legitimate reasons when abortion is for the greater good. Certainly, the higher good is not the earlier lack of brain in the would-be parent (because first, that the child is not to blame for anything here, and two, that you have to take responsibility for your actions) or the so-called ""accident"" (ut supra). When deciding to have intercourse - even if in practice it is hormones and not brain cells that guide our behavior - you should be aware of the possible consequences. Solving a potential problem after the fact through surgery or the morning-after pill is as legitimate as running over a police officer who pulled you over for drunk driving."
2583	127	And above all, common sense
2583	129	And that's what it all comes down to. Appropriate sex education, treating the fetus as a human, not a new model of a toy (a child with suspected physical disability or, for example, Down syndrome, in principle qualifies for the procedure - due to our history, you do not even need to pronounce the name of a person who had very similar views out loud; do we really want to be the leader with the specific mustache on a micro scale?), taking consequences for our actions - only this much, or as much, is enough to work out a reasonable compromise. The anti-abortion act will then counteract pathology, just as the act on upbringing in sobriety counteracts extreme cases, not a conscious citizen who wants to drink a glass of wine with dinner.
259	1	OSW expert: Russian troll factories are trying to show Ukrainian refugees in a negative light.
259	3	"""Issues in Polish-Ukrainian relations, especially historical events, are eagerly used by Russian propaganda to divide Poles and Ukrainians,"" said Katarzyna Chawryło, an expert at the Warsaw Center for Eastern Studies (OSW). She added that the Kremlin's propagandists are trying to spread the negative message about refugees to all EU countries."
259	5	so-called troll factories also reach and will reach in the coming months for content that shows Ukrainian refugees in Poland in a negative light - she added.
259	9	The exploitation of threads concerning Ukrainian citizens fleeing to the West has a broader dimension and is not only related to Poland. Propagandists are trying to reach societies in EU countries by disseminating content that would imply that refugees are a source of danger - this is to lead to a situation where they (refugees - RMF FM's note) will not be welcome. The current situation (the war between Russia and Ukraine - RMF FM) makes rhetoric aimed at refugees an important element in the Kremlin's disinformation message. Its overriding goal is to minimize the West's support for Ukraine, stressed Chawryło.
259	11	The Russian narrative has a significant presence in Hungary, Serbia and partly in Germany.
259	13	According to the analyst, the so-called troll factories (state-controlled companies publishing propaganda content on the Internet, mainly on forums and social networks - RMF FM's note) are still employing new people, which indicates the intensification of the Kremlin's activities in the field of information warfare.
259	15	The expert emphasized that the Kremlin's long-term investment in favorable expert and media circles in the West is currently not bringing the expected results. The war with Ukraine completely changed the situation, even turned it upside down. First, the scale and brutality of Russian crimes against civilians in Ukraine are obvious and difficult to defend. Secondly, the EU and US sanctions against the Russian media, resulting in the limitation of their broadcasting in Western countries, have significantly reduced the scope of the propaganda's influence. As far as European countries are concerned, however, the Russian narrative has a significant impact in Hungary and Serbia, and partly also in Germany, assessed Khawryło.
259	17	Trips that some journalists like to take.
259	19	"The interlocutor drew attention to the ""usefulness"" of some Western journalists in the broadcast of the regime on Russian television."
259	21	"The Kremlin organizes study trips for such people to the occupied territories, e.g. to Mariupol. Recently, they have participated in journalists from Germany and France, as reported by Russian television. These are representatives of niche media, but their presence is enough to build a propaganda message on Kremlin television about ""objective Western reporters, striving for the truth, despite the censorship prevailing in the West,"" said the analyst."
259	23	Do Russians Trust TV? The results of the survey are not reliable.
259	25	According to an expert from the Warsaw-based center, the recently published survey of Russian public opinion, conducted by the international company GroupM and showing the decline in Russian confidence in state television, should not be treated as representative. The study was valuable because it confirmed the trend observed for years - television remains the main source of information for Russians, but trust in it is decreasing. However, only respondents from large cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants took part in this survey. inhabitants, therefore the results cannot be regarded as authoritative. In the Russian provinces, where Putin enjoys the greatest support, television plays a much greater role than in urban centers, the analyst explained.
259	27	"The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach residents with ""appropriate"" content."
259	29	"Khavrilo also referred to the propaganda ""cover"" of Russian activities in the occupied territories of eastern and southern Ukraine."
259	31	"The invaders do not spread any subtle message there, but rely on strictly force solutions to intimidate the inhabitants. Included in this scheme are switching off Ukrainian television and replacing it with Russian programs, as well as destroying access to Ukrainian internet connections and mobile networks. The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach the inhabitants with ""appropriate"" pro-Russian content - for example, there are reports that ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" (a daily publishing propaganda content) is distributed along with humanitarian aid - emphasized the OSW expert."
2590	1	ZChR to Solidarna Polska: Let's organize public space together, getting rid of symbols of foreign power
2590	3	"– Today, we are handing over this project to Solidary Poland, which, having 20 deputies, can submit it to the marshal's cane, so that from spring 2023 there will be no monument-like object in public space that glorifies the Red Army, the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"", the People's Army Polish or even Otto von Bismarck. Current solutions enable the defense of objects of glory by numerous local governments, e.g. Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn. If the parliament accepts our project, then on January 1, 2023, all such objects would be under the ownership supervision of the competent voivode and if they are currently in the register of monuments, they will be removed from it. This will allow you to delete these objects. Naturally, this project is also a commensurate reaction to the removal of Polish flags from Polish war cemeteries in Miednoje and Katyn by the Russians. Importantly, the objects of foreign glory in question will no longer be legally protected as monuments, and therefore will not be covered by the disposition of Art. 261 of the Penal Code. We are counting on Solidarna Polska's favor in this matter - tells us Paweł Czyż, spokesman for the Union of Christian Families. INTERVIEW WITH CHR SPOKEMAN"
2590	5	Independent Gazeta Obywatelska: Ombudsman, where did this initiative come from?
2590	7	"ZChR spokesman Paweł Czyż: Well, the troops of the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine. At the same time, some local governments defend monuments of gratitude to the Red Army, for example, the authorities of the Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn communes. Such actions must be stopped and hundreds of totalitarian symbols as well as Prussian militarism removed. Few people know that on Polish territory we still have the so-called ""Bismarck towers"", i.e. objects built to commemorate the Chancellor of the Reich Otto von Bismarck, e.g. in Działdowo, Dzierżoniów, Jańska Góra, Lębork, Mrągowo, Okonek, Ostróda, Szczecin, Świdwin, Świebodzin, in Wieleń, Sobótka, Zielona Góra, Żagań and Żary. It's a mockery that all these symbols litter our cities. Also, the Polish People's Army does not deserve to be commemorated. On September 17, 1939, the USSR actually became a participant in World War II as an ally of the Third Reich. Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski expressed the view that Russia had betrayed by going armed to help the Germans and striking us in the back with a knife at the agreed moment: ""(...) henceforth we are at war with the Soviets on an equal footing with the Germans."" On April 25, 1943, Stalin severed relations with the legal Polish government. It should be mentioned that the President of the Republic of Poland, Władysław Raczkiewicz, refused to sign the agreement of July 30, 1941 Sikorski-Majski, and therefore the Red Army's re-entry into the territory of the Second Polish Republic in 1944-45 took place without the formal consent of the legal Polish government, i.e. it constituted the implementation of the premises of illegal occupation. In June 1943, the Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, General Władysław Sikorski, recognized Berling's army as a ""Polish communist division of a diversionary character"", its creator himself as a ""traitor who deserted from the Polish Army"". Since we are not commemorating the Polnische Wermacht - the armed forces of the Kingdom of Poland established under the act of November 5, in the period from April 10, 1917, when Austria-Hungary transferred the Polish Auxiliary Corps under the orders of the General Governor of Warsaw, Hans Hartwig von Beseler, to October 13, 1918. – there is no reason to commemorate the so-called 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"" or the Polish People's Army. Dot. What is very important, no one will be prosecuted for their alleged damage under Art. 261 of the Penal Code."
2590	9	NGO: You count on the support of Solidarna Polska. But what about PiS?
2590	11	"Paweł Czyż: It will turn out, however, some Law and Justice politicians were susceptible to the communist legend that Berling's army is our Polish armed forces. It happens that PiS politicians lay flowers at the monuments of the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"". It is said that Poles served in this formation. This is clear, but no part of the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"" in general is due. It is as if we were officially constantly undermining the position of the legal Polish authorities in London. It's time to put the historical facts in order and we hope that the parliamentarians of Solidarna Polska will ""behave themselves"". It is worth emphasizing that in the case of Red Army monuments in Mikolin, in the Lewin Brzeski commune or in Olsztyn, MP Janusz Kowalski from the SP came with considerable help. Therefore, we appeal to Zbigniew Ziobro's party: let's organize public space together, getting rid of the symbols of foreign power."
2591	1	German MP: We need to return to talks with Russia about launching Nord Stream 2
2591	3	“The federal government (in Berlin) must now do everything to ensure the energy supply. We need to talk with Russia, despite the war that violates international law, about putting Nord Stream 2 into operation for a certain period of time, if gas supplies cannot be guaranteed in any other way,” said Ernst.
2591	5	"“A gas supply interruption could irreversibly damage Germany's +industrial backbone+,” he added. In his opinion, the actions taken by the Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, will not solve the problem, because ""other countries are not able to fully compensate for gas supplies"" at a level comparable to supplies from Russia."
2591	7	“Energy sanctions don't work. (…) On the contrary: energy sanctions are beneficial for Russia. (…) The explosion in the prices of raw materials such as oil and gas means that Russia earns more from energy sales than before,” said Ernst.
2591	9	"As the politician of the Left argues, ""it is immoral to maintain sanctions in this way"" because ""Russia continues to make good money from its raw materials, and our citizens and our economy suffer from a completely wrong sanctions policy."" “We should only take measures that truly end the war and do not harm our own citizens,” concludes Ernst."
2594	1	Japanese about the war in Ukraine. Just shock...
2594	3	Free translation, Eternity;
2594	5	Hiroyuki Hamada
2594	7	"I would repeat as many times as necessary. The Western establishment overthrew the Ukrainian government with the help of the Nazis in 2014 to ignite a proxy war against Russia. Most Westerners have bought into the outright lie that Russia unprovoked attacked Ukraine, when in fact Ukraine has been ruthlessly bombing the Russian-speaking population, massacring, maiming and depleting them for the past 8 years. Many of us have raised our voices on this issue only to be called ""Putin lover"", ""Russian bots"" and so on. Meanwhile, the pawns of the Western war against Russia continue to die in Ukraine. The US-backed Ukrainian government is sending untrained civilians between the ages of 18 and 60 to the front lines. Do you know what that means?"
2594	9	"I am 54 and have a son who is 18. We would die for Western imperialism if we were Ukrainians. The Ukrainian establishment murders its own officials, journalists and anyone who stands against their path of Western imperialism while continuing to slaughter Russian-speaking Eastern Ukrainians as ""separatists"". This is what ""stand with Ukraine"" means. This means subsidizing the Western defense industry, turning peacefully coexisting nations into killing each other, restructuring the economy to accommodate Western oligarchs, and selling off public wealth to these predators. People might think it's just harmless virtue signaling to prove how ""good"" you are in their communities to echo the current imperial slogan, but people actually suffer and die from it. The same was happening all over the planet. I come from Japan. I have relatives there. What happens to Ukraine can happen to any US-backed Asian country because China is the empire's original target. I feel the sadness and pain of Ukrainians, Russians and all the people who suffer from US imperial violence."
2594	11	Breaking news:
2594	13	Shinzo Abe - former Prime Minister of Japan - was shot dead in Nara, Japan. This is quite shocking, partly because this is Japan where such things are rare, and he himself is the grandson of World War II war criminal Kishi Nobusuke, who also became prime minister after the war. Their political party - the liberal Democratic Party - is known to be backed by the CIA. Shinzo Abe was known to sympathize with the Russian stance on the war in Ukraine.
2595	1	13 million people in the Horn of Africa will suffer from hunger due to global warming - News Portal STRIKE
2595	3	It will definitely be a difficult year for Africa, and forecasts for its difficulty level are becoming more and more pessimistic from month to month. According to the UN, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya will suffer the most.
2595	5	$327 million – that's how much money the UN's World Food Program (WFP) will need to meet immediate livelihood needs over the coming months and help make rural communities more resilient to the growing climate shocks. The Horn of Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia - is most vulnerable to famine.
2595	7	3 years without rain
2595	9	All three countries have not seen rain for three years, resulting in the worst drought since 1981.
2595	11	"""Crops are being destroyed, livestock are dying, famine is on the rise, all because of repeated droughts affecting the Horn of Africa,"" says WFP East Africa regional director Michael Dunford. Dunford warns that without adequate humanitarian aid, the Somali humanitarian crisis of 2011, when 250,000 people died of famine, could be repeated. And this, unfortunately, cannot be ruled out, because the average rainfall is expected to decrease instead of increasing, according to forecasts."
2595	13	The critical situation is in the south-eastern part of Ethiopia - according to UNICEF, by mid-March this year, as many as 6 million people from these areas may need humanitarian assistance. In neighboring Somalia, the number is expected to exceed 7 million.
2595	15	Africa reaps what we sow
2595	17	Despite being the continent that contributes least of all to global warming, Africa feels climate change the hardest and suffers the most serious consequences. The drought in the Horn of Africa is a prime example of this. Over the past 100 years, surface temperatures in Africa have increased by 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. According to scientists, in this century they are to exceed even these 2 degrees.
2595	19	UNICEF says that around 15,000 children have left school to help with water and other daily tasks as a result of the drought. A UNICEF representative in Ethiopia announced via videoconference at a UN briefing in Geneva that the vast majority of water sources had dried up and stressed the need to renew wells, drill new ones and supply water to health care facilities.
2595	21	No place in the world has shown so clearly how tragic the consequences of ignoring the climate catastrophe can be. For the time being, the price for galloping and uncaring capitalism has been paid the least by Africa, which is to blame for all the turmoil, but it is only a matter of time before the same problems that Africans are currently struggling with will come north.
2598	1	Colonialism is still going on. And it is one of the causes of climate change
2598	3	In the third part of the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists for the first time pointed to colonialism as the historical and current cause of the climate crisis, i.e. the greatest global threat to humanity.
2598	5	Colonialism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, but it can be seen as the conquest of territories and states accompanied by three types of violence: cultural violence through the negation of indigenous culture, economic violence through the exploitation of the population, and political violence through oppression and taking away the self-determination of the inhabitants.
2598	7	The impact of colonialism on nature is clear and can be seen through huge mines, polluted rivers and depleted lands. On every continent, colonizers cleared mangroves, grasslands, tropical forests, and wetlands to make way for quarries, plantations, ranches, roads, and railroads.
2598	9	The fact that this one specific word is included in the IPCC report may not seem like a big deal, but it is quite the opposite. Together with each report, the IPCC publishes a summary for policy makers. This summary is meticulously analyzed and discussed line by line - not only by the world's best scientists, but also by officials representing 195 governments, who influence the final wording of the summary and often comment on individual words or phrases.
2598	11	"The fact that ""colonialism"" is included in the summary means that officials and scientists around the world recognize the significant role that this phenomenon has played in ""heating"" our planet and destroying its nature. Atmos magazine noted that the role of colonialism in triggering the climate crisis has been part of the narrative of the climate justice movement for decades. For example, at last year's COP26, Brazilian indigenous activist Taily Terena opened the Indigenous Pavilion, saying that ""colonialism has caused climate change"" and the solution is ""give rights to indigenous peoples."""
2598	13	"How did ""colonialism"" come up in the IPCC report? First of all, the fact that this time more women and people of non-white skin color worked on the report, i.e. social groups particularly affected by this phenomenon, was not without influence. Second, as Atmos points out, in the eight years since the last IPCC report, there has been an explosion of literature pointing to the links between climate change and colonialism. IPCC reports, on the other hand, compile conclusions from thousands of existing works. The authors put them together and present the public with a complete picture of the scientific consensus."
2598	15	"One study showing links between colonialism and climate change was published in the journal ""PNAS"" in 2020. In it, a pair of archaeologists analyzed the climate in the Caribbean Islands and in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean. Researchers have discovered how the changes have been compounded by a history of colonization and injustice. The Caribbean is facing increasingly intense hurricanes driven by warming oceans. In addition, these threats are expected to increase with climate change caused by human activity."
2598	17	At the same time, the researchers found that colonization forced islanders to move away from methods of building resilient homes. Archaeological excavations in the Caribbean have revealed a history of circular buildings with deep-set columns made of strong local timber and light thatched roofs. However, after the colonization of the islands, European architecture displaced the traditional one. Today's homes are made of reinforced concrete rather than locally available materials, and are easily damaged by hurricanes. This reduces the chance of buildings surviving and rebuilding after intense tropical storms.
2598	19	Similarly, Madagascar's forests and other natural resources were destroyed by Europeans who wanted to make more profit from the colonies there. Today, the descendants of indigenous peoples live in poorer lands affected by soil degradation, erosion and deforestation, making these lands even more vulnerable to climate change.
2598	21	However, the relationship between colonialism and climate change is not just a relic of the past. Currently, the concept of carbon offsetting is also being analyzed as a new form of this phenomenon. That's because it allows developed countries to take advantage of developing countries by using their low carbon emissions to offset their ever-increasing carbon emissions.
2598	23	"Many companies have committed to becoming climate neutral. To achieve this goal, more and more of them reach for carbon offsets. According to strategic consulting company McKinsey, the market for voluntary carbon credits could reach as much as $50 billion by 2030. The term ""carbon offset"" refers to carbon that is being reduced, avoided or captured from the atmosphere to offset emissions produced elsewhere."
2598	25	Most carbon offset projects involve reforestation. Cutting carbon emissions by planting more trees in developing countries may seem like a good idea. However, through initiatives to slow the pace of climate change, richer countries dominate less poorer ones and their inhabitants, creating a new form of neo-colonialism - climate colonialism. Rich countries invest in countries of the global South and dictate how to maintain land and forests to people who have lived there for thousands of years. When a new normal that those in power want indigenous peoples to adopt conflicts with how indigenous groups typically deal with their own land, this can potentially lead to displacement and even violence.
2598	27	In 2014, the Oakland Institute revealed that the Kenya Forest Service, funded by the World Bank, had beaten, threatened and even arrested members of the Sengwer community to obtain land for forestry for CO2 compensation. At a 2016 United Nations meeting, an indigenous leader from Turtle Island accused developed countries of privatizing and selling sacred forests and land that they owned. Carbon offset projects harm the population, also changing the economic system on which its survival depends.
2598	29	Most of the carbon offset projects are located in the countries of the Global South, and most are bought by the countries of the Global North. So instead of holding governments accountable and changing existing patterns of production and consumption, actors in developed countries are using carbon offsets as a form of indulgence. They force the countries of the Global South to change their economies so that the countries of the Global North can continue to emit CO2.
2598	31	So how to eliminate the phenomenon of climate colonialism? First, by giving indigenous peoples co-determination in climate investments concerning their lands and landscape transformation, and also simply by returning their lands. It is also important to fund long-term Indigenous land management programs and give Indigenous people autonomy in spending decisions, as well as leveraging the ecological expertise of local communities.
2599	1	"Korwin-Mikke: ""ice is growing in Antarctica"". The thesis cannot be defended"
2599	3	"Janusz Korwin-Mikke, MP of the Confederation, argued on August 6 on Polish Radio 24 that what is said about the need to close coal-fired power plants or promote more ecological energy sources is ""nonsense"" and humanity has ""gone crazy"". ""These environmentalists are crazy too,"" the Confederate politician was indignant. Korwin-Mikke talked about the natural cycle of carbon circulation in the environment and argued that this element ""was in the air, somehow the earth survived it"". ""So if it goes back into the air again, what will happen?"" It's warming up, and that's fine. They're threatening to raise the temperature two degrees, and that's great. It will be in Poland just like in Czech Prague, so nothing will be so terrible – he perorated."
2599	5	"Korwin-Mikke went on to talk about the ""previous global warming"", which he claimed happened around the 11th century, when Greenland was ""a green land, as the name suggests"". He also talked about the ""peak of global cooling"" and about the ""local, global cooling"" around 1600. - There is no sign that the water level has risen in any special way - continued Korwin-Mikke. He added that he had already read 30 years ago that in 20 years the Maldives would be under water. ""Meanwhile, property prices in the Maldives are going up,"" he said."
2599	7	Ecologists don't say one thing...
2599	9	"The most significant part of Janusz Korwin-Mikke's argument was the thesis about Antarctica, where the ice cover is supposedly growing. The politician explained that the reason for the increase in ice is the movement of water vapor over this continent. ""The environmentalists don't say one thing: indeed, ice turns to water, that's true, but water turns to steam,"" he explained. - For example, in Florida, everyone can find that it's muggy, right? Then steam is formed, this steam, by the way, condenses in the province of Saint Catherine in Brazil. In Brazil, they have snow that hasn't been seen for 200 years, and it's a lot of snow, and then this couple flies over Antarctica and, to the amazement of environmentalists, ice builds up in Antarctica. This is the steam above Greenland, it melts, evaporates and travels south - said Korwin-Mikke."
2599	11	The recording of Janusz Korwin-Mikke's speech was shown to Dr. Jakub Małecki, a glaciologist-hydrologist who studies glaciers. He is associated with the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. The expert decided that it is impossible to defend the statement that the ice in Antarctica is growing. There is less and less of it, and this is due to human activity over the last hundred years.
2599	13	"Prague in Warsaw? ""A man will ricochet"""
2599	15	"Doctor Jakub Małecki explains that climate changes have occurred many times in the history of the Earth, which was influenced by the activity of the Sun, orbital cycles of the Earth and changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases. - We are especially interested in the recent changes today, because we are experiencing them at a very fast pace - says Dr. Małecki. When about 12,000 years ago, the last glaciation ended, it took nature about 1,500 years to raise the average global temperature by 1 degree Celsius. ""We and our CO2 emissions did it ten times faster,"" he notes."
2599	17	He goes on to explain that nature emits as much greenhouse gas as it can absorb. Now it is impossible - the combined CO2 emission of nature and people is slightly higher than the total absorption. The surplus of CO2 accumulates every year, and the disproportion between natural and actual concentrations is growing.
2599	19	"Will - as Janusz Korwin-Mikke claims - in Poland it will be like in Prague and ""nothing will be so terrible""? Dr. Małecki replies that in the case of Poland, global warming of 2 degrees may mean a 3-degree increase in temperature or even more. - Such warming means huge and unfavorable changes for nature, including plants, fauna and hydrology of the country. It's not cool, because the ricochet will always hit a person - he says. He notes that the increase in temperature of one degree Celsius over the last little more than 100 years is an average value for the entire globe, including the oceans that cover most of it. And the land is warming up faster than the oceans."
2599	21	Ice in Antarctica is being lost by underwater melting, not by warm air
2599	23	Doctor Jakub Małecki says that greater warming is clearly visible in the polar regions - some have already warmed by several degrees Celsius. In the Arctic, located around the North Pole, the ice floe floating on the sea is disappearing, mountain glaciers are disappearing, the Greenland ice sheet is melting faster and faster.
2599	25	Contrary to what Janusz Korwin-Mikke suggests, the name of Greenland (literally - green land) was given to the island's discoverer and outlaw Eryk Rudy, who wanted to encourage settlers from Iceland to colonize it. - In the times after the birth of Christ, it was never green, i.e. with a clearly smaller range of ice than today - notes Dr. Małecki. There was no global warming around the 11th century, and no global cooling until 1650. Temperature changes were noted at most locally or regionally. - Research shows that the global climate cooled down extremely slowly but systematically from about 5000 BC until the 19th century, when human activity seriously entered the climatic game - says Dr. Małecki.
2599	27	As he explains, the ice situation around the south pole is more complex than in the north. A clear distinction needs to be made between sea ice (ice floes) floating in the Southern Ocean and land ice on the Antarctic continent. Today, the floe covers a slightly larger area than in the 1980s. Stronger winds push it further and further away from the coast. - The ice sheet generally systematically loses mass and the overall rate is increasing - emphasizes Dr. Małecki.
2599	29	"The ice sheet is divided into two main parts: a larger eastern one and a smaller western one. - The eastern part is doing well: most studies for the last two to three decades find either a relatively stable mass, even with periods of growth, or only relatively small losses - explains the expert. ""It's worse with the western part, which loses mass quickly,"" he adds."
2599	31	This is to a lesser extent due to more intense surface melting, and primarily due to underwater melting and the breaking off of icebergs into the ocean. For Antarctica, therefore, the greatest threat is not the warming air, but the rising temperature of the water surrounding it. - So it is impossible to defend the statement that the ice in Antarctica is increasing. Overall, it loses it, even though the temperature inside the continent never rises above zero, concludes Dr. Jakub Małecki.
2599	33	Increased water evaporation? Glaciers lose mass anyway
2599	35	In an analysis for Konkret24, Dr. Małecki emphasizes that he is not aware of any scientific sources that in the 1990s would alert against the flooding of the Maldives around 2010. - This risk is real for 2100, because it is the flattest and lowest-lying country in the world - evaluates Dr. Małecki. He adds that these islands may become uninhabitable due to the potentially much greater extent of storm surges or flooding than in the past.
2599	37	"Mountain glaciers around the world and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica melt, pour their meltwater from the land into the ocean and raise its level. - Ice is the largest contributor to this process, followed by thermal expansion of the warming oceans - explains Dr. Jakub Małecki. The current growth rate is 3-4 cm per decade. Too small to be observed with the naked eye, but detectable by instruments and satellites. ""If the rate of CO2 emissions continues to increase, by the end of the 21st century, sea levels may rise on average by up to a meter compared to pre-industrial times,"" the expert estimates."
2599	39	"He emphasizes that increased evaporation from the oceans is not able to remove the excess water in the oceans, because after a short time after evaporation, the water goes back to the ocean as rain or river water. - Increased evaporation may, however, result in greater precipitation, and such a trend is actually observed in some regions of the world - admits Dr. Małecki and adds that this also happens in some glaciated zones, which results in greater snow supplies there. ""Unfortunately, these increases are usually too small to compensate for the negative changes caused by higher temperatures, and despite snowier winters, these glaciers still lose mass"" - he says. ""In East Antarctica, this mechanism probably contributes to the relative stability of this part of the ice sheet."""
2599	41	The expert, however, denies that the increased snowfall in Antarctica is related to evaporation in Florida and the transport of steam through Brazil, where there has been recent snowfall in the south. - First, steam transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres is hampered by equatorial winds. Secondly, the recent snowfall in southern Brazil did not come from the north, but from Antarctica, i.e. from the south, says Dr. Małecki.
