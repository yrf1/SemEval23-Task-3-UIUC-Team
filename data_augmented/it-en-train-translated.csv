261	1	The strange silence of no-lockdowns
261	3	​Twenty-six million citizens locked up at home. Recluses. At home. The inhabitants of Shanghai, the first city by population in China and third in the world, are subjected to a very strict lockdown
261	5	"Twenty-six million citizens locked up at home. Recluses. At home. The inhabitants of Shanghai, the first city by population in China and third in the world, are subjected to a very severe lockdown in the name of the (bankruptcy) policy renamed ""Covid zero"". A policy that rather than eliminating the infections is razing the already limited freedom of the Chinese to the ground. Deserted streets, families left without food and unable to leave their homes even for essential needs, supermarkets stormed by hungry crowds, positives detained against their will in Covid centers that look like prisons. A ""health disaster"" in the face of which the world seems to be silent. What happened to those who, in our latitudes, denounced a non-existent health care dictatorship for almost two years? How come no one launches petitions, hashtags, photos and protest sit-ins against the human rights violations of the Beijing regime? Where is the fervor with which they defended all sacrosanct liberties? We cultivate some suspicions around here. Faced with the images of the ""deportations"" of the sick to the Chinese megalopolis, the idea that there was a healthcare dictatorship in Italy sinks into ridicule and remains naked in all its speciousness. And, suddenly, those who up until a few weeks ago were screaming have now lost their words. Perhaps also because many of them have gone directly from the No Vax trench to the pro Putin one. And, as we know, the fascination for autocracies is contagious: it takes a moment to even defend the Chinese regime. The short circuit is perfect."
26101	1	A chimpanzee would do better than Gigino Di Maio: he is so ignorant as to let the Farnesina publish a map where he mistakes Moldova for Ukraine
26101	3	After Matera in Puglia and Russia bordering the Mediterranean, Foreigners are unable to distinguish Ukraine from Moldova. As they say, we are in an iron barrel…with nails inside.
26101	5	I was wrong, a chimpanzee in occupying that position would have done less damage.
26101	6	It gets better when Gigino gets used by Nato as Corvo Rockefeller.
26101	7	It is interesting to note how suddenly, for the regime media, he has become an untouchable.
26101	8	NATO's propaganda apparatus squads against opponents and offers media protection to its lackeys.
26101	9	This character, without media coverage, would have evaporated long ago.
26101	10	However one puts it, the Tweet is almost a situationist work.
26101	12	“We'd like to understand what the Farnesina meant with this Tweet.
26101	13	Because either the map is wrong, and it would be quite serious, or the aid has sent them to the wrong country (and it would be even more serious ..).
26102	3	"«We would have worked for the draw at the CSM, so as to break the mechanism. We would have revolutionized the responsibility of the magistrate who makes mistakes », writes the Florentine senator in his book Il Mostro. This is why the currents, first of all Md, did not want Gratteri to become Keeper of the Seals. Role that fell to the piddino Andrea Orlando, evidently considered ""reliable"" by the corporation. It was Renzi, yesterday, during the presentation of his book, who confirmed the worst version, the one that until now had been left behind the scenes. «Giorgio Napolitano», he recounted, «using the prerogatives of the Constitutional Charter, he told me that he did not want Gratteri as Minister of Justice. Point""."
26102	5	The head of state did nothing but implement the veto of currents, concerned with defending the status quo. «Not only the democratic judiciary, but also Unicost», from the centrist area, «was absolutely opposed to Gratteri's candidacy, because he would have gone there against the currents. Others did not appreciate Gratteri for his not exactly guaranteed positions. But there is no shadow of a doubt that Gratteri, at that moment, was an element of absolute disruption of the system, of real scrapping».
26103	3	Spring should bring a breath of fresh air, but reading the newspapers these days it is disconcerting to read how, after years of austerity and misery and despite pandemics and wars, the guardians of orthodoxy continue to offer us the usual recipes.
26103	5	"On 23 May the European Commission published the Country Reports, i.e. the reports with which the Commission expresses the results of its monitoring of the economic and social conditions of the Member States, expressing a series of recommendations with which the process of surveillance of the budgetary policies (but not only) of the States. A surveillance which, as part of the post-pandemic recovery plan, is closely linked to the disbursement of funds from the Next Generation EU program and, therefore, to the PNRR. In fact, as Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, recalled, with reference to the specific recommendations for each country, ""until now it depended only on the countries to respect them or not, but now the recommendations are linked to subsidies and potential loans"""
26103	7	Obviously, there is also some for Italy, and reading it makes one's arms drop.
26103	9	"Already on the front page, the report tells us ""who we are and where we come from"", and perhaps this is the only thing we have to thank him for because with a simple graph he reminds us, erasing the unbearable rhetoric of the various ""best"" who have following, that since the financial crisis of 2008 not only has the gap with the other European economies dramatically increased, but even the pandemic has caught Italy with a real GDP still 3% lower than the pre-2008 level; the rest is recent history: the most significant fall in GDP in Europe during 2020, a ""rebound"" which - unlike what happens in other countries - is largely insufficient to recover the lost ground, the GDP line which with the war returns to become horizontal and at a level that is always lower than in 2008; in short, 15 years in which we have lost ground not only in a relative sense but also in an absolute sense."
26103	11	"What the report, incidentally, forgets to mention is that in these fifteen years - and in particular from 2011 until the beginning of the pandemic - we have been among the most diligent students in carrying out ""homework"" (read: apply austerity measures with continuous primary surpluses and eliminate what little social measures remained), faithfully applying the ""advice"" that we found in the reports of previous years: in short, a reading that to be honest is equivalent to a rejection of the ""master ”, and not of the pupil."
26103	13	"But anyhow: the report dedicated to Italy happily shrugs and proposes the usual recipe made up of cuts, reforms and (the only novelty) ""waiting for the PNRR...""."
26103	15	Continuing with the description of the existing situation, the drafters of the report regret that - also due to the non-temporary measures adopted in the last two years - the public deficit will continue to exceed the magical threshold of 3%, regretting the good times (for them) of the 2019, when we had reduced it to 1.5% also thanks to an impressive series of primary surpluses: yet today we know well what this meant during the pandemic, for example in terms of lack of services, hospital staff, beds or chicken coop classes and dilapidated structures (just to mention two of the most affected sectors).
26103	17	"We continue with the inevitable ""excessive macroeconomic imbalances"". Imbalances which translate, in the language of the Commission, as ""excessive public debt"". A public debt to be cut indiscriminately, especially through the reduction of public spending. Thus going to aggravate the already dramatic situation of public services in Italy and unemployment. The latter is obviously an imbalance that the Commission can tolerate."
26103	19	"Furthermore, the ""structural weakness of the labor market"" is mentioned, even if the Commission must also recognize that the partial recovery in the level of employment after the pandemic is essentially due to precarious work."
26103	21	Last but not least, the report reminds us that Italy is among the European countries most dependent on Russian gas, and that therefore it will probably suffer the most from the economic repercussions of the war.
26103	23	If this is the state of the art, the outlook on the future is if possible even more depressing: said of the need to resume the march towards a balanced budget (and with all due respect to those who rejoice at the suspension of the stability pact: after all , if we are the best, we self-inflict austerity…), all hopes seem to be placed in the salvific properties of the PNRR, with respect to which it should be remembered that Italy is the largest beneficiary in absolute terms and one of the only four countries to have also requested access to loans.
26103	25	"Putting aside that - as we have already explained elsewhere - this intervention is largely insufficient when not openly contradictory, what is really impressive is seeing the various ""reforms"" associated with the PNRR lined up: cutting red tape to heal a public administration ""not sufficiently responsive to business needs” (sic!), public employment reform (and the example given is that of fixed-term experts hired precisely for the management of the PNRR), liberalizations (particularly for public services, see local transport, water, rubbish, etc.)… in short, all stuff that has already been seen and heard, and unfortunately often already applied, to the point that we know all too well the harmful effects on our quality of life."
26103	27	For the rest, little else, including a tax system to be reformed by shifting the weight more to taxes on consumption (and particularly low rates are targeted, i.e. the tool to try to mitigate the effects of a structurally regressive tax) and on real estate (including first homes).
26103	29	"However, the European Commission is in good (indeed, bad) company: the annual surveillance mission to Italy of the International Monetary Fund ended on 17 May, and even in this case, before leaving, the experts thought it appropriate to leave us a few Advice: In addition to calling for a broken record “a credible two-pronged strategy to significantly reduce the high deficit and debt over the medium term”, this report focuses more on the economic consequences of the war by making it clear that “the fiscal response to the energy shock should be more contained than what happened for the pandemic”; the ""solutions"" in this case are identified in the REPower EU plan (therefore practically nothing) and on social bonuses (see the recent and largely insufficient Aid decree). Also in this case, the most interesting thing lies in what the report does not say: in the presence of crazy bills, go ahead and give a few coins to those more on the ground, but woe to request a more profound and structural intervention by the State in regulating the market; even timid interventions on some bill items such as excise duties and system charges are discouraged because ""although this immediately reduces prices for families and businesses, energy efficiency is discouraged and the advantages are for the benefit of all consumers""."
26103	31	In conclusion, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund are calling for order, effectively proposing the same recipes thanks to which we were found without tools in the face of the disaster of the pandemic.
26103	33	We know that the improvement of our quality of life passes through an exactly opposite path: relaunching of social spending by the State and local authorities (which also means current spending, for example, to pay doctors, nurses, teachers, etc.), political coherent environmental and energy policies, stable employment contracts and decent wages, a truly progressive tax system.
26105	3	I have read that in these hours there is a part of the Movement that has proposed a draft resolution that moves us away from the alliance between NATO and the EU - says the head of the Farnesina da Gaeta - NATO is a defensive alliance, if if we get out of line we put Italy's security at risk.
26105	5	"Di Maio claims: ""NATO is a defensive alliance"". We do not comment and we do not want to mention the offensive crimes of the Atlantic Alliance, we simply invite you to read the book by the American intellectual Noam Chomsky and the philosopher and essayist Andre Vltchek entitled ""Western Terrorism"" (Ponte alle Grazie), where you will find all what you need to know on the subject. Nor do we comment on the presence of dozens of nuclear warheads under the direct orders of the NATO masters present in our territory, which, yes, put our present and future security at risk."
26105	7	We do not comment on them simply because in fact, Luigi Di Maio's words, taken up by Repubblica yesterday, lead him by right to overcome the Atlantic fundamentalist delusions of any Molinari or Riotta.
26105	9	"However, we are interested in bringing to your attention another aspect and it is the hysteria with which the foreign minister and the Republic raised the ""scandal"" so early."
26105	11	After the ridiculous peace plan mocked by the whole world, the tenant of the Farnesina and the Fiat newspaper go back to working hand in hand.
26105	13	The reason is soon said.
26105	15	On June 21 Mario Draghi will be forced to go to Parliament. He would certainly have done without it and probably in the next legislature this duty before a European Council will be lifted. But for now he will be forced. And the majority parties must define a shared resolution.
26105	17	For those who, like Conte and Salvini, have expressed criticism (in words) in recent weeks on the shipment of secret weapons to the Kiev regime - which have made Italy a co-belligerent country against a nuclear power vital to our economy - all the knots inevitably come home to roost.
26105	19	So what do Repubblica and Di Maio fear and what is the urgency of this coordinated exit?
26105	21	"Simply that someone can force their hand slightly, when our ""allies"" ask for blind obedience to their diktats."
26105	23	The leader of the M5S has a very simple checkmate move on his side, which if not caught will rightfully place him among the worst Quislings in recent Italian history: immediately remove from the government the blank delegation given by ALL majority and majority parties disguised as the Brothers of Italy (made law with a vote of confidence in the Senate on March 31st). Blank proxy which, we remind you, allowed Draghi, Di Maio and Guerini to issue three successive decrees - hidden from Parliament - with a number of secreted and undeciphered weapons that reached Kiev and probably to the neo-Nazi battalions that also in these hours they are guilty of crimes against the civilian population of Donbass.
26105	25	This is what Di Maio and Repubblica are afraid of, so much so that they return to coordinated operations, despite the miserable failure of the infamous peace plan released by the Fiat newspaper.
26105	27	"After the shameful vote given in Parliament also by his 5 Star Movement - with the exception of Vito Petrocelli who paid for his choice with the illegitimate dismissal from the post of president of the Foreign Affairs Commission - Conte can checkmate the vassals of NATO and the more extremist warmongers, simply accepting the invitation of Mattia Crucioli of Alternativa and president of the neo-group CAL. In a letter that, like the Anti-Diplomatic, we published to you on Wednesday, Crucioli invited all parliamentarians ""to write together"" a resolution that removes the government's blank delegation on the issue."
26105	29	Do not block the shipment of arms, but allow Parliament to become sovereign again and vote on every single subsequent decree. Each party must be held accountable to public opinion on any future choice and Parliament must be informed of how many and which Italian weapons have been delivered to Kiev.
26105	31	What is Conte waiting for to accept that invitation?
26105	33	Here's what Di Maio and Repubblica are afraid of.
26105	35	Giuseppe Conte, who in words has shown repentance in recent weeks of the blank proxy vote given by his party, has no alternative: either he proceeds to remove it, even at the cost of withdrawing his ministers from the government, or his inglorious political end it will be history. Judgment with a new article on Wednesday.
26106	1	G7 in Monaco: they matter so little that even the demonstrators no longer care
26106	3	Germany takes over the leadership of the G7, but nobody cares about it. The G7 looks like a retired ARCI circle, where former powers meet who once were something, and who now spend their time deluding themselves that they still are. A bit like Prodi, who now goes to preach on TV thinking he is still something, but who, after having undone Italy and having flirted a bit with everyone. now it doesn't matter anymore.
26106	5	"The G7 now counts for so little that even the counter-demonstrations, organized by the usual fake alternative organizations, such as the WWF, ATTAC and other ""environmental"" organizations have flopped. A colossal flop: the police expected 20,000 people, in the end only 3,500 arrived. In the end, four cats, who staged a ridiculous demonstration ""Because there is a climate crisis, because we risk the extinction of the species ” and other amenities that have now become trivial."
26106	7	After all, what is the point of demonstrating towards a group of people who, on the one hand are the foragers of these organizations, on the other they no longer count for anything. Biden is in big trouble dealing with inflation. Johnson is in trouble for the economy, but also for internal problems, with half the party rebelling against him, amidst scandals and electoral flops. Scholz, who is not Merkel, is leading a contradictory majority and an economy close to recession and de-industrialization. Macron has lost the legislative powers, he governs, but he no longer reigns as before. Draghi is a bankruptcy manager of Italy placed by others. Only Trudeau and Kishida are firmly in the saddle, with their own economic problems, even if they are secondary compared to those of the USA.
26106	9	At the end of the G7, nobody cares about anything: it is enough to know the confused decisions of the American presidency to have an idea of ​​what is happening elsewhere. meanwhile the EU is just an executor: even if Germany, France and Italy wanted to do something different, a remote-controlled Von Der Leyen would arrive from the Dems and put them back in line. So the G7 is good for photos and, perhaps, for a nice beer, but politically it counts for nothing, absolutely nothing.
26109	1	THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN SECURITY COUNCIL COMES BACK TO ATTACK THE WEST: “THE LEVEL OF POLITICIANS HAS DROPPED LOW. IT IS CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT MARIO DRAGHI IS NOT SILVIO BERLUSCONI AND OLAF SCHOLZ IS NOT ANGELA MERKEL” – “THE GREAT LEADERS OF THE PAST WERE NOT RUSSOPHOBES, AND THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A NEW GENERATION OF WEAK PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES TECHNOCRAT…”
26109	3	"The level of Western politicians has ""dropped to the bottom"" and ""I have seen it with my own eyes in the last 20 years"". In Europe, for example, ""there is not even a trace of political figures of the level of Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac or Margaret Thatcher"" and ""no offense to anyone, but it is clear to everyone that Mario Draghi is not Silvio Berlusconi, and Olaf Scholz is not Angela Merkel."""
26109	5	"Words of the deputy president of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, who in a new message on Telegram returns to rail against Europe. According to the former Russian premier and former president, the great leaders of the past, who ""were never Russophobes"", have been replaced by a new generation of ""weak people"" who ""conventionally define themselves as technocrats."
26109	7	"Some of them are quite qualified specialists, but nothing more. And therein lies the problem! These people are able to correctly formulate an idea, give precise instructions to assistants. But I can't take responsibility."" «They try to hide, mislead, talk about the economic situation, even about climate change but they don't make a decision. Or they take it with a catastrophic delay. And that's already total trouble."""
26110	1	Crisis drought and desertification: this is why revolutionary ecology is needed
26110	3	The drought has hit Italy with a new and stronger wave: the rivers are dry, the water basins are languishing and agriculture suffers – from north to south – due to the aridity of the land and sudden attacks by parasites and grasshoppers, as is happening these days in the inland areas of Sardinia. It is not a biblical scenario but the torrid Italian spring-summer of 2022. What should a nation do that is moved by will and not by resigned fatalism? Here is a reflection on the subject.
26110	5	Drought and desertification
26110	7	"As you can already imagine, the problem is more serious and complex than the simplistic narrative that environmentalists are making regarding the water emergency. The story is always the same, but it doesn't help... on the contrary, to say that anthropization and human work cause the climatic upheaval that is reported almost daily to unified networks means offering a decisive assist to the desert. The problem, it seems obvious to say but it does well to repeat, is above all political – and by political I mean the highest that can be assigned to this term. But first let's see what's happening and dispel some myths: when we talk about drought, we immediately think of the summer period, the season with no or little rain par excellence. And in general it is like this, because it has always been like this. At least since Someone or something pushed our planet into a dance of rotation and oscillation around the Sun. Drought is not a summer event, or rather, it finds its destructive outlet in the summer. In fact, the problem is in the autumn and/or winter period because in these periods, in which land and aquifers should be ""supplied"" with the water necessary to face the heat, there is instead that lack of rain that the most stupid foolishly in the summer. Especially, it is important that snow accumulates in quantities on the mountains, in order to then release the water more slowly during the spring melting phase. It is therefore obvious that the causes of the drought, especially in northern Italy, must be sought higher than the Po valley, given that, as should be known thanks to a school geographical atlas, all the so-called left tributaries of the Po (Mincio, Adda, Ticino, Oglio etc…) are of glacial origin, i.e. their flow is regulated by the seasonal melting of the Alpine glaciers. The same goes for the large lakes such as Garda and Como, the same goes for the large non-tributary rivers of the Po which however flow through the entire north-east, such as the Adige, the Isonzo and the Piave. Geographic excursus aside, drought is not fought in the summer and Politics (always the one with a capital ""P"") should move at the source, not at the mouth - literally."
26110	9	Matter of will
26110	11	"Before tackling a more philosophical than practical discourse, it is useful to make some historical references, at least for the sake of the truth, both on the so-called climate issue and on the avant-garde works undertaken by Italy at the beginning of the last century. Let's give some reference points to understand what we are talking about: the climate issue has as its main argument the increase in temperature on earth, which is an objective fact as it is the product of numerous scientific surveys. However, the perception that we have thanks to the media overexposure is that the temperature has increased and is continuing to increase by several degrees. We actually know that since the year in which temperatures were started to be recorded scientifically and objectively, i.e. since 1880, 140 years ago, the temperature on earth has risen by 0.9 degrees. To this fact it should be added that around the mid-1800s a period defined as the Little Ice Age ended, which began in the mid-1400s; it goes without saying, as the name suggests that during these centuries the earth has experienced a period of cooling especially in the northern hemisphere: we have evidence of ice that allowed us to walk on the Thames. It is a natural consequence, again due to that ""touch"" that started the oscillation of this geoid called the Earth, that since the end of the ""little"" glacial period the temperatures have gradually risen. Not to mention the great glacial periods that we know to have been geological events, the last one ""just"" 14,000 years before Christ. A blink of an eye for such far-reaching natural cycles. However, from this objective datum arise two currents of thought that are to say the least subjective, bordering on fatalistic superstition. I rely here on the words of Dr. Guglielmo Pannullo, who in an article for the Student Block of 2020 well exposed these currents: ""Skeptics and catastrophists - he explains - have two diametrically opposed points of view on the causes of global warming, and until a few years ago the discussion was mainly confined to the Anglo-Saxon world. The fulcrum of the discussion is the reason for this increase, not the how much. The role of the world of information and lobbies around the subject has led to the polarization of positions and the formation of these two opposing sides. As for the skeptics – continues Pannullo – the position of prof. Zichichi, of whom an interview for Il Primato Nazionale came out a few months ago, who claims that the models in vogue today for forecasting climate change are unpredictable, since the climate is a phenomenon that has so many mutable factors that it cannot be absolutely predicted with a mathematical model. Consequently, he believes that the causes of global warming are linked to activities external to the earth, such as solar activity, and in any case not due to man. At a global level, however, the credibility of the skeptic component has, in some cases, been strongly questioned following the discovery that some exponents or supporters of global warming have been consultants to oil companies such as Exxon, Shell and Texaco etc. On the other hand, the catastrophic component attributes the full responsibility for climate change to man, seeing the causes of global warming in too much CO2 and in the emissions of climate-altering gases. Instrument used by catastrophists are the reports of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, i.e. a group of scientists who do not carry out environmental or climate monitoring but study scientific publications, research products and make reports more frequently five years or less. This latest report from 2014 highlighted how the majority of scientists believe that man is probably the cause of global warming""."
26110	13	"It is therefore clear, thanks to this exhaustive explanation, how serious a problem of perspectives is regarding the environment, polluted without too many words by a Judeo-Christian vision of the world (""Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it, dominate the fish of the sea and the bird of the sky and every living thing creeping on the earth"" - Genesis 1,22) which contains in a nutshell the separation between human and cosmos which reaches the capitalist and Marxist vision through the secularization of the West: the materialist one, where the environment is something else, it is part of capital, it exploits the use value and makes everything around us materially useful. But the problem then – you will say – is men. This is not the case, because as far as catastrophists and hippies may say, man is the decisive ecological agent for the rebalancing of ecosystems."
26110	14	The solution is man
26110	16	"The solution is man. The solution then is Politics. If man is an animal, ordered in the cosmos together with all living things, he is necessarily a political animal, i.e. community, supportive, aggregative, technical and historical. Our nature without a predestined habitat (like the oceans for plankton) moves us towards the organization of our space according to our political instinct. Couple, family, tribe, village, city, region, state, nation, empire… they are all forms of organization that are not only social, but above all natural. Or rather, let's stop thinking about what is social and political as something distinct and separate from our lives, separate and inimical to nature. The first step of revolutionary ecology is to reject the schemes of homo oeconomicus according to which the main characteristics of a man are rationality (understood in the primary sense, above all as precision in calculation) and the exclusive interest in the care of his own individual interests. Consumerism, intensive production, exploitation of the environment and of precarious work are effects not causes. We also reject the Enlightenment myths of the noble savage who carries with them the kind of biological racism that considers industrial society superior to tribal society, but is moved by the good feelings of bringing the tribals down to their level by force. The problem is ideological: if you consider the problem only in a fatalistic key ""it's bound to be like this"", then the desert will continue to advance and dry up our land. So let's move on to the drought problem."
26110	17	A political problem
26111	3	"“Contrary to Washington's triumphant pronouncements, Russia is winning the war and Ukraine has lost the war. The debate is open on the long-term damage caused to Russia"". Thus Graham E. Fuller, former vice president of the National Intelligence Council at the CIA, who details the consequences of this ""American-Russian war fought by proxy to the last Ukrainian""."
26111	5	In the note, Fuller explains that “US sanctions against Russia have proved far more devastating for Europe than for Russia itself. The global economy has slowed down and many developing nations face severe food shortages and the risk of rampant hunger.”
26111	7	"The devastation suffered by Europe is creating critical issues in the relationship between it and Washington, which is forcing its clients to support at their own expense its line of ""errant and hypocritical foreign policy, based on the desperate need to preserve 'American leadership' in the world"". And it remains to be seen whether he will agree to join the ""ideological"" war against China without reservations, on which the Old Continent depends more than on Russia."
26111	9	“One of the most disturbing features of this US-Russian fight in Ukraine has been the sheer corruption of the independent media. Washington won the information and propaganda war hands down, coordinating all Western media and forcing them to sing the same hymn book that is characterizing the Ukrainian war. Never before has the West witnessed such a total imposition of an ideologically driven geopolitical perspective [...] Caught in this virulent barrage of anti-Russian propaganda, the likes of which I have never seen even in my Cold Warrior days, serious analysts they have to dig deep to get an objective understanding of what is actually happening in Ukraine.”
26111	11	"The grip on the media has had the effect of silencing ""almost all alternative voices"". “But the most dangerous implication is that as we head towards future global crises, we are witnessing the disappearance of a truly free and independent press”, while public opinion is prey “to media dominated by multinationals close to political circles, which enjoy the support of electronic social media; all actors who manipulate the narrative to their own ends. As we face predictably greater and more dangerous instability produced by global warming, refugee flows, natural disasters and likely new pandemics, the strict state and corporate domination of Western media becomes very dangerous indeed for the future of democracy ” (oddities of this so-called struggle between democracy and autocracy…)."
26111	13	As for the geopolitical changes dictated by the Ukraine crisis, Fuller notes that “massive US sanctions against Russia, including the confiscation of Russian funds in Western banks, are causing most of the world to reconsider going all-in on US dollar in the future. The diversification of international economic instruments is already underway and will weaken Washington's once dominant economic position and its 'one-sided weapon', the dollar.
26111	15	"Furthermore, Russia's move towards Asia now appears to be an irreversible destiny, producing that China-Russia axis that Washington has long feared as an existential threat. This process has reached such a point that the idea of ​​disjointing this axis, put forward by many Western analysts and politicians, is now a pure ""fantasy""."
26111	17	"""Unfortunately for Washington, almost all of its expectations about this war are turning out to be wrong"", concludes Fuller, according to whom in the future this time could prove to be the moment in which the West has become aware of the error inherent in condescension towards the American claim to ""preserve its global dominance"", which will inevitably create ""new confrontations, increasingly dangerous and harmful with Eurasia"". While “most of the rest of the world – Latin America, India, the Middle East and Africa – sees no national interest at stake in this fundamentally American war against Russia”."
26111	19	If we refer to these opinions, which are not new to this site, it is because they are stated by an authoritative source that certainly cannot be accused of pro-Putinism, an accusation that was also abused during the endless wars by Western propaganda, which from time to time silenced the critical voices of be pro-Saddam, pro-Assad. pro-Iranians, pro-terrorists and whatnot. Nihil sub sole novum.
26111	21	The only novelty is that in the past, during the previous stages of this infinite war - which necessarily had to turn against Russia and China (and against Europe, more or less indirectly) - is that while the Arabs and the Africans nobody cared about anything (as nothing cares now about Yemen). Now that the war affects the price of petrol and food, it does matter. Also from this point of view, nihil…
26113	1	“THERE IS AN ECONOMIC CALCULATION BEHIND PUTIN'S IMPERIAL DREAM”
26113	3	"John Lennon's hit song ""Imagine"" has always been a popular song for the wrong reasons. ""Imagine that the world will live as one"" is the best way to end up in hell."
26113	5	"Those who cling to pacifism in the face of Russian aggression on Ukraine get entangled in their own version of ""imagination."" Imagine a world in which tensions are no longer resolved through armed conflict. Europe has persisted in this world of 'imagination', ignoring the brutal realities far from its borders."
26113	7	Now it's time to wake up.
26113	9	The dream of a quick Ukrainian victory, a reiteration of the original dream of a quick Russian victory, is over.
26113	11	"In what looks increasingly like a protracted stalemate, Russia is making slow progress, and its ultimate goal is explicit and stated. You no longer need to know how to read between the lines when Putin compares himself to Peter the Great: 'At first glance, it seemed that he was taking something away from Sweden. He wasn't taking anything away from her, he was giving it back. Naturally, it was also up to us to take back what belonged to us and to strengthen the country""."
26113	13	"Rather than focusing on particular issues (is Russia really simply ""giving back"" something? And to what?), we would do well to carefully read Putin's words that legitimize his statement: ""To assert a certain type of leadership any country , any people, any ethnic group must guarantee its sovereignty. Because there is no middle ground, no intermediate state: a country is either sovereign or a colony""."
26113	15	"What these words imply is clear: there are two categories of states, the sovereign ones and the conquered ones. From Putin's imperial perspective, Ukraine falls into the latter category. Moreover, as is equally evident from the official Russian declarations of recent months, the ""second category"" also includes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Finland, the Baltic States and, ultimately, Europe itself."
26113	17	"Now, therefore, we can understand what was meant when Putin was invited to ""save face"". It means accepting not so much a negligible territorial compromise in Donbass, but Putin's imperialist ambition. The reason why this ambition should be rejected outright is that in our global world today, in which we are all plagued by the same catastrophes, we are all pulled into the middle, into an intermediate state, which is neither a sovereign country nor a conquered country: to insist on full sovereignty in the face of global warming is sheer folly, because our very survival depends on close global cooperation."
26113	19	Russia, on the other hand, does not limit itself to completely ignoring global warming: why did it get angry with the Scandinavian countries when they expressed their intention to join NATO? With global warming, control of the Arctic Northwest Passage is at stake. (For this same reason Trump wanted to buy Greenland from Denmark). Due to the explosive evolution of China, Japan and South Korea, the most important communication route will pass north of Russia and Scandinavia. Russia's strategic plan is to take advantage of global warming: to control the most important communication route, as well as to stimulate the development of Siberia and control Ukraine.
26113	21	In this way, Russia will assume a preponderant position in the production of foodstuffs, which will allow it to blackmail the whole world. This is the economic reality behind Putin's imperial dream.
26114	3	A criminal and insane policy. Those who arrive by sea and land are not enough in Lamorgese. He wants to get more by air.
26114	5	Remember: every immigrant who arrives in Italy means sharing ever fewer resources with another. It means less money per capita. Less place in hospitals, kindergartens, social housing and transport. It means less water and electricity. In the age of scarcity it is an even greater crime.
26114	7	Not only open ports and the institutionalization of NGO traffic, not only thousands of Tunisians landed and then released on the territory with a ridiculous no-go document. Not only luxury ships where to send them on a cruise.
26114	9	The government of contagion and invasion is also speeding up the flights that bring us immigrants to Italy.
26114	11	The Italian government is the ******* of Sant'Egidio. Which in turn is the ******* of the invasion.
26114	13	"""These are difficult moments that see our country engaged on various fronts, starting with the Ukrainian crisis where we have had many requests for protection but I believe it is very important to start and continue along the line of humanitarian corridors because it is important that there is a method legal to arrive in the Mediterranean countries”. Thus the Minister of the Interior, Luciana Lamorgese, on the sidelines of an event in Naples."
26114	14	“One of the legal methods that we are pursuing with great determination is that of humanitarian corridors. – he concludes – The fundamental point is to try to talk more and more about legal methods to get them from other countries to Italy”.
26114	16	Overall, 4,400 refugees have arrived in Europe with the system of the notorious humanitarian corridors, of which over 3,600 in Italy.
26114	18	Italy sinks into a crisis with no way out, these criminals with Lampedusa attacked by thousands of illegal immigrants go to Greece to get them. A member country of the EU. People arriving from Cameroon and Congo. Or from countries like Iraq and Syria where the war ended years ago and could go home. We are governed by criminals who prostitute us to the Vatican humanitarian traffickers.
26114	20	We have to go get them.
26114	22	The goal of these 'humanitarian corridors' sponsored by Sant'Egidio, an entity that works for the ethnic deconstruction of Europe, is not to help, but to use these people by deporting them to Europe. Otherwise, the work of organizations such as Sant'Egidio to prevent real Syrian refugees from returning home from Lebanon and Turkey could not be explained:
26115	3	"It is a great fortune for Italy to have a minister like Roberto Cingolani. Double good luck, since the Milanese physics professor heads a dicastery with obscure, but certainly fundamental competences, that of the ""ecological transition"". Cingolani is, as they say, a technician, a key category of our time, which gives an aura of omniscience, independence and indisputability to the actions of those who boast the appellation."
26115	5	"The real fortune, for the fate of the Italian people, is that Cingolani has a sort of direct line to heaven. A year ago he ruled that planet Earth was designed for three billion people, a concept repeated even recently. In a conference on nanotechnologies, the minister professor asserted (no, assured, the technicians do not assert, they assert ex cathedra) that “human beings are parasites because they consume energy without producing anything. The planet was designed for three billion people, there are too many of us, we are parasites”. He added ""that it can destroy any cell with a magnetic field applied to intelligent nanoparticles (iron oxide) by heating it to fifty degrees with an external magnetic field."""
26115	7	"We have understood nothing – mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, illiterates of Science and Technology – but the minister's words seem vaguely threatening. Waiting to leave this world pierced not by a moonbeam but by a murderous magnetic field, we thank Cingolani for having sincerely pronounced the words that the oligarchies hide behind flues, verbal acrobatics and false philanthropies. Strange philanthropists convinced that there are too many of us crowding the planet, who assume the right to determine who will be able to escape intelligent nanoparticles, assisted suicides, mass euthanasia, pandemics perhaps created in secret ""gain-of-function"" laboratories. Another unbearable euphemism to describe techno-scientific caverns in which Cingolani's colleagues covered by diving suit-like protections work to strengthen existing viruses (or create new ones), with the virtuous official goal of tracking down antidotes and vaccines."
26115	9	The fact is that Cingolani, privileged interlocutor of the Designer, of the Selfish Gene, in intimate relations with the author of the Big Bang, knows two fundamental things: the world was designed, perhaps by the Great Architect of the Universe, a gigantic philosophical, theological discovery and scientific. Furthermore, he knows (the designer confided this to him) the maximum expected number of human beings: three billion. Sigh of relief, since several oligarchs, pardon philanthropists, indicate much lower figures, obviously including themselves among the survivors.
26115	11	Out of jest - a very bitter sarcasm - the Malthusian project of the Western elites is evident. No conspiracy: they speak clearly, they act accordingly. Let's recap, for the use of the forgetful. Thomas Robert Malthus, an Anglican pastor, philosopher and economist of the early nineteenth century, worried about the increase in population and sincerely struck by the horrible living conditions of the workers, massed in the nascent industrial English cities, proposed various measures to ensure that the population did not would increase. Fifty years ago, the so-called Club of Rome, financed by the financial elites of the time, relaunched the project to decrease the population for ecological reasons, with catastrophic forecasts that were largely erroneous.
26115	13	Today the most ardent anti-natalists are the environmentalist sectors for which man is nothing other than the great intruder of the planet, the enemy of Gaia, nature hypostatized as a living being. The circle closes with Cingolani, spokesman for the oligarchies. After all, minister technician is the stage name charged with prestige, neutrality and scientific infallibility, attributed to trustees to whom power entrusts the task of carrying out policies contrary to popular interests, presented as inevitable, salvific, fruit of superior wisdom, almost esoteric. Knowledge or ideology? And above all, is the Malthusian operation - which for Cingolani means the suppression of more than half of the living - based on truth? No, according to other scientists, demographers, armed with the arithmetic laws of statistics. For them, demographic collapse is the main threat to civilization.
26117	3	This is the average number of presumed foreign minors who are dumped in Italy by their parents every year to be maintained at our expense. Exploiting our idiotic laws and the hunger for minors of the Di Bibbiano Party.
26117	5	With all the risks that this entails, when you bring in an army of young males whose sole purpose is to rape Italy.
26117	7	"A Swiss study, carried out by the mental health department in Geneva, found that 80% of ""unaccompanied minor"" asylum seekers have mental health problems. It doesn't surprise us. I'm a time bomb."
26117	9	Potential that, moreover, we have already seen in the mass harassment of Cologne, in the many Islamic attacks that we have experienced in recent years and, above all, in the constant news stories: between raped girls and torn apart adolescents.
26117	11	"""This is a time bomb"", declared the German scholar Christian Peter Dogs speaking of the decision to open the borders, explaining that psychiatry has long since discovered that an individual's behavior and personality are already fixed at the age of 12 years. This much as a reminder to the proponents of the so-called 'ius culturae'."
26117	13	"According to Dogs, migrants ""cannot be educated"" to understand our values"", because they are already trained. And that the courses on how to behave, so fashionable among do-gooders, will have no effect."
26117	15	“There are people who have an insane potential for aggression because they grew up surrounded by war. They have learned to fight and they don't even know the meaning of living harmoniously,” she explained.
26117	17	"Dogs, who runs the Max-Grundig clinic in Bühlerhöhe, also warned that people are ""really afraid of what is happening and feel insecure"", explaining that his clinic has treated a large number of people with severe anxiety disorders that after the wave of attacks by immigrants. Citizens who, by now, no longer feel safe leaving their homes due to the massive arrival of immigrants."
26117	19	This anxiety can only have social and political implications. Usually the psychiatrist, if he has an adequate historical and cultural preparation, is able to grasp these implications in advance.
26117	21	A frightened population is willing to do anything to stop being afraid. And then comes the one who interprets this fear and promises to make it disappear. And then they are dicks.
26117	23	Not only false attestations of minor age, to collect more money with the reception of 'minor' immigrants, but also the reception extended beyond 18 years: up to 21 years. It is required by the Zampa law of the PD. Created to supply coops with fake or real foreign minors instead of bringing them back to their parents.
26117	25	A sort of Bibbiano on steroids.
2612	3	"On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell led a congressional delegation to visit the Ukrainian capital. The unannounced trip included Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Susan Collins of Maine and John Barrasso of Wyoming. McConnell unveiled the trip after he ""just left"" Ukraine, calling it an ""honour"" to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. McConnell's statement emphasized that the group of US officials ""reaffirmed"" to Zelensky ""that the United States strongly supports Ukraine and will sustain our support until Ukraine wins this war."" It is also essential that America does not stand alone."" Basically, Zelensky took the opportunity to argue that the US should designate Russia as a ""terrorist state"". Zelensky made a similar request to British MPs."
2612	4	"McConnell's statement continued: ""It is absolutely in our national interest to help Ukraine achieve victory in this war and to help Ukraine and other countries deter other wars of aggression before they start."" The Republican delegation's ""victory"" speech echoes statements by House of Democrats Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she met with Zelensky in Kyiv earlier this month. You at the time said from neighboring Poland soon after your trip that Washington will support the Ukrainians ""until victory is achieved"" against Russia."
26120	3	"""We will not cede southern Ukraine to Russia."" Thus Zelensky yesterday, placing a tombstone on the possibility of starting negotiations with the Russians shortly. In this way he wanted to respond, in a public and unequivocal manner, to the requests of Macron and Scholz, who, during their visit to Kiev (together with Draghi), had asked him to resume negotiations."
26120	5	"Nothing in fact, the president who flaunts the army green T-shirt in all circumstances, cannot distance himself from America, which does not allow him alternatives to war. To strengthen Zelensky's relaunch, the parallel declaration of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who affirmed that the war ""could last years""."
26120	7	"If in recent days the ""peace party"" had had a jolt in the West, opening glimmers, it can be noted with a certain sadness that this hint of vitality was promptly silenced. On the other hand, it was also quite evident in the reports of the journey of hope (to use a term used in religious pilgrimages) by Scholz and Macron: very few important media had reported on the request made by the leaders (and those who reported it did so with the distraction of the case), limiting himself to reiterating the mantra of Ukraine's entry into the EU."
26120	9	"We took the definition ""peace party"" from Steven Erlanger, Times reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner, who, when asked by Yana Dlugy for the New York Times, said that over Ukraine in the West there is a conflict between the "" party of peace” and the “party of justice”."
26120	11	“The justice party – explains Erlanger -, basically made up of Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and Great Britain [and the USA, of course], believes that there is something more at stake than Ukraine, which is European security theme. And that if Putin doesn't feel defeated, if he doesn't stop there, then, somehow, he will continue ”in his assertiveness.
26120	13	“The peace party fears that the objectives of the justice party are the extension of the war, to the point of risking an escalation, to the involvement of NATO countries in the war, with the aim of cornering Putin”.
26120	15	There is some truth in these lines, but the concluding consideration is even more correct, namely that if America no longer supported Ukraine, the war would end quickly, if not immediately.
26120	17	The cessation of hostilities would not so much see Moscow invade Kiev - a move that would threaten the case only to force the hand of the adversary - but the Ukrainian leadership would immediately open up to negotiations, which the Russians would welcome, being able to declare the war over and proclaim victory .
26120	19	"In reality, the ongoing clash is not only between an asserted ""justice"" and an irenic ""peace"", but above all between a foreign policy based on realism and that, dominant in America (and, alternatively because it is subordinated, in Europe) , forged by hyper-liberal and/or neo-conservative ideology."
26120	21	This clash is described very well in an article by Sumantra Maitra in the National Interest, to which we refer. Here we limit ourselves to reporting a reflection by Hans Morgenthau reported therein on the need for realism in politics.
26120	23	"“Realism holds that universal moral principles cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation, but that they must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place. The individual can say: ""Fiat iustitia, pereat mundus (Let justice be done, even if the world perishes),"" but the State does not have the right to say it in the name of those under its guardianship""."
26120	25	"“Both the individual and the state must judge political action on the basis of universal moral principles, such as that of liberty. However, while the individual has the moral right to sacrifice himself in defense of such a moral principle, the state has no right to let its moral disapproval of the infringement of liberty stand in the way of successful political action, itself inspired by the moral principle of national survival. There can be no political morality without prudence; that is, without considering the political consequences of an ostensibly moral action""."
26120	27	"A reflection that the NI reporter comments on, explaining that while realism is certainly not devoid of negative aspects, ""it is not comparable to the crusades for democracy of the last thirty years""."
26120	29	"A primary comment, since even the support for Ukraine and its fight ""to the last Ukrainian"" against the invader, even if at the beginning it could be identified as a dutiful support for the attacked, by now, this leaf of cool, it has taken on the aspect of a crusade for freedom and democracy typical of endless wars."
26120	31	This religious nature, which does not allow dissidence (dissidence is heresy), makes this war an existential and incurable conflict, excluding a priori not only negotiation, but the very idea of ​​negotiation. So much so that in the disquisitions of the experts and analysts who speak for and on behalf of the dominant power, negotiation is not even mentioned except as a vague colloquial residue to reassure the masses.
26120	33	It does not matter that the world is scourged by the consequences of war and especially of sanctions: inflation and the risk of stagflation in the West, hunger in Africa, widespread turbulence and street violence on the horizon, the risk of new waves of migration, an increase in global destabilization… just for talk about certain consequences, that there is no limit to uncertainty.
26121	3	After two years of lockdown they went wild in multiracial toy trains around the world and then brought it to Europe. It's not at all surprising that he had the ability to mutate so quickly.
26121	5	"The virus responsible for the current monkey vaccine outbreaks “has mutated surprisingly strongly,” according to a Portuguese study published in Nature Medicine. “Compared to related viruses in 2018 and 2019,” the pathogen now has “approximately 50 differences in genotype,” a figure “6-12 times higher than what would have been expected for this type of virus based on previous estimates ”, explain the authors who hypothesize an “accelerated evolution”. ""Our data show further clues about the ongoing viral evolution and potential adaptation"" of the Monkeypox virus ""to humans"", underlines the work led by João Paulo Gomes of the Instituto Nacional de Saúde 'Doutor Ricardo Jorge' (Insa) of Lisbon. Until now, experts had spoken of a rather slow development for the pathogen, especially when compared to the mutation speed of the Covid-19 coronavirus."
26121	7	Portuguese scholars suspect that the origin of the new monkeypox outbreaks are one or more entries from a country where the Monkeypox virus circulates persistently, with 'super spreaders' and international travel that may have fueled a further escalation of contagion. The authors hypothesize that enzymes of the human immune system may have played a role in inducing these changes in the viral genome. The researchers point out that there is currently no evidence on the possibility that the mutations are favoring the spread of the Monkeypox virus, but that it is also not possible to exclude it.
26123	3	As we wrote yesterday, the bishops, totally unaware of their now evident irrelevance, demand the approval of the ius scholae. Another version of the ius alone.
26123	5	About Ius Soli and citizenship. And speaking of the reckless sermons of the bishops and their bosses, it is interesting to find out which law is applied in the Vatican in matters of citizenship.
26123	7	Vatican citizenship is regulated by art. 4 of the law on Vatican sources of 2009 and of the Lateran Pacts of 1929. Therefore, Vatican citizenship is not obtained by ius soli. They're not stupid, they. As with the question of 'bridges and not walls', they preach it to us mere mortals, not put it into practice for them: I know me, thinks Bergoglio, and you are not shit.
26123	9	In particular, obviously apart from the cardinals who don't reproduce, or at least they shouldn't, one of the most restrictive Ius Sanguinis in the world applies to Vatican citizens, even if they call it differently.
26123	11	Vatican citizens are, in fact, the spouse and children of a Vatican citizen, but only if they are cohabiting.
26123	12	Ascendants and siblings of a Vatican citizen, but only if they are cohabiting.
26123	14	As of December 31, 2021, there were just over 600 people in possession of Vatican citizenship. An exclusive club. Very exclusive.
26123	16	Not only. The spouses lose their citizenship if the marriage is annulled or dispensed, if the separation is pronounced or if the children or siblings of a Vatican citizen at the age of twenty-five are unable to work and are dependent on the Vatican citizen.
26123	18	Only the pontiff, who is a dictator, can grant and restore Vatican citizenship for other reasons. Vatican City does not recognize political rights for its citizens since it is an absolute monarchy with a lifelong character.
26123	20	Maybe it's time to complete the liberation of Rome.
26124	1	UN: 19 million Yemenis suffer from hunger. USA and Great Britain send weapons and military instructors
26124	3	We apologize to the readers. We have repeatedly written that the war waged by Saudi Arabia against Yemen with the support of weapons from the West, the USA and Great Britain in the lead, is of no media and political interest. It's not like that, it's all targeted, there's all the interest, since 2015, when the Saudi monarchy started this aggression, with Barack Obama as US President, to cause genocide, with bombings, naval blockades, theft of resources, in particular oil, to erase all traces of the Yemeni people and appropriate their resources.
26124	5	The Yemeni people have resisted heroically in recent years despite terrible suffering. But while public attention has been diverted to the war in Ukraine, the UN has raised a chilling alarm.
26124	7	According to the latest UN report, 19 million Yemenis are currently facing food shortages, the highest number since the Saudi-led coalition's invasion began.
26124	9	"The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) commented: ""More than 19 million people are suffering from hunger, more than 160,000 of them on the verge of famine... Fund cuts are hampering our ability to help people in need""."
26124	11	The office added that the World Food Program (WFP) cut food rations for eight million people in December last year due to lack of funds, introducing another round of cuts last month.
26124	13	Five million people are estimated to receive less than half of their daily food requirements, with eight million receiving less than a third of their daily requirements.
26124	15	The report also highlights that eight million women and children are in need of nutritional help, with over 500,000 children severely malnourished.
26124	17	Media reports suggest that potentially further funding cuts will begin on July 1.
26124	19	The UN report comes days after a UAE tanker departed the port of Radhum in Yemen's southern Shabwa province on June 26 after stealing more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil from the oil-rich region. this precious hydrocarbon.
26124	21	A Yemeni official told Yemeni news agency Saba that the estimated cost of the stolen cargo was $43.64 million, according to international oil prices.
26124	23	An enormous, important figure that could have saved millions of Yemenis by purchasing food and medicine.
26124	25	"The ""humanitarian"" move of the USA and Great Britain"
26124	27	While the Yemeni population is on its last legs, here comes the US and Great Britain to wreak havoc even more on what was already the poorest country in the Arab world before the war.
26124	29	The billions of dollars and pounds worth of weapons supplied to the House of La Saud were not enough which, as reported to the Saba agency by Al-Qatabi Ali Husein al-Farayi, the governor of the province of Al-Mahra, located in eastern Yemen, shipments of weapons aboard military vessels have landed at Nishtun port and British and American military trainers are stationed at Qaydah International Airport.
26124	31	Warning of the dangerous plots by the Saudi-Emirati occupation coalition against Al-Mahra and his people, he indicated that the attackers and their allied militias are trying to plunge the province into chaos and utter confusion, because the locals oppose the presence of foreign forces.
26124	33	"The Saudi-led coalition of aggression is involved in drug smuggling and trading in the area to perpetuate insecurity, further their evil plans and dissuade the local population from confronting the invaders,” the governor warned.
26124 35 There is no contradiction with what is happening in Ukraine. To safeguard their interests, especially the US and Great Britain, they are ready, with different facade motivations, to sacrifice every last Ukrainian or Yemeni on duty, prolonging wars and chaos.
26125 1 Behind the Tin Curtain: BRICS+ vs NATO/G7
26125 3 The West is nostalgically involved in outdated ""containment policies"", this time against the integration of the global South. Unfortunately for them, the rest of the world is moving forward, together."
26125	5	Once upon a time there was an Iron Curtain that divided the European continent. Coined by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the term referred to the efforts of the then Soviet Union to create a physical and ideological border with the West. The latter, for his part, pursued a policy of containment against the spread and influence of communism.
26125	7	Let's press the accelerator and land in the contemporary era of techno-feudalism, in which there now exists what should be defined as a Tin Curtain, built by the collective, fearful and naive West, through the G7 and NATO: this time, for contain essentially the integration of the global South.
26125	9	The BRICS against the G7
26125	11	"The most recent and significant example of this integration was the emergence of BRICS+ at the Beijing-hosted online summit last week. This went far beyond defining the outlines of a ""new G8"", let alone an alternative to the G7."
26125	13	"Just look at the interlocutors of the five historical BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa): we find a microcosm of the global South, which includes South-East Asia, Central Asia, Western Asia, Africa and the South America - really putting the ""global"" in the global South."
26125	15	Revealingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin's clear messages during the Beijing summit, in stark contrast to the G7 propaganda, were actually aimed at the entire Global South:
26125	17	- Russia will fulfill its energy and fertilizer supply obligations.
26125	19	- Russia expects a good grain harvest - and to supply up to 50 million tons to world markets.
26125	21	- Russia will guarantee the passage of grain ships in international waters even if Kiev has mined Ukrainian ports.
26125	23	- The negative situation on Ukrainian wheat is artificially inflated.
26125	25	- The sharp rise in inflation in the world is the result of the irresponsibility of the G7 countries, not of Operation Z in Ukraine.
26125	27	- The imbalance in world relations has been going on for a long time and has become an inevitable result of the erosion of international law.
26125	29	An alternative system
26125	31	Putin also directly addressed one of the key issues that the BRICS have been discussing in depth since the 2000s: the design and implementation of an international reserve currency.
26125	33	The Russian Financial Message Transmission System is open to connection with the banks of the BRICS countries.
26125	35	The Russian payment system MIR is expanding its presence. We are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the BRICS basket of currencies, the Russian leader said.
26125	37	This is inevitable after the hysterical post-Operation Z Western sanctions, the total de-dollarization imposed on Moscow and the increase in trade between the BRICS countries. For example, by 2030, a quarter of the planet's oil demand will come from China and India, with Russia being the main supplier.
26125	39	"The BRICS ""RICs"" cannot risk being excluded from a financial system dominated by the G7. Even acrobatic India is starting to catch the ball."
26125	41	"Who speaks for the ""international community""?"
26125	43	At present, the BRICS account for 40% of the world's population, 25% of the global economy, 18% of world trade, and contribute more than 50% to world economic growth. All indicators are growing.
26125	45	"Sergey Storchak, CEO of the Russian bank VEG, framed the matter rather diplomatically: ""If the voices of emerging markets are not heard in the coming years, we will have to think very seriously about creating a parallel regional system, or perhaps a global one ""."
26125	47	"A ""parallel regional system"" is already under discussion between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and China, coordinated by the Minister of Integration and Macroeconomics Sergey Glazyev, who recently wrote a dazzling manifesto amplifying his ideas on world economic sovereignty."
26125	49	"Develop that ""developing world"""
26125	51	What happens on the trans-Eurasian financial front will proceed in parallel with a hitherto little-known Chinese development strategy: Global Development Initiative (GDI), announced by President Xi Jinping at the United Nations General Assembly last year.
26125	53	The GDI can be seen as a support mechanism of the overall strategy, which remains the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), consisting of economic corridors linking Eurasia up to its western peninsula, Europe.
26125	55	At the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, part of the BRICS summit, the Global South learned more about the GDI, an organization established in 2015.
26125	57	Simply put, the GDI aims to give a boost to international development cooperation by integrating funding to a plethora of bodies, such as the South-South Cooperation Fund, the International Development Association (IDA), the Asian Fund Development Funds (ADF) and the Global Fund for the Environment (GEF).
26125	59	"Priorities include ""poverty reduction, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines"", industrialization and digital infrastructure. Subsequently, a group of Friends of the GDI was established in early 2022, which has already attracted over 50 countries."
26125	61	"The BRI and GDI are expected to advance hand in hand, even though Xi himself clarified during the BRICS summit that ""some countries are politicizing and marginalizing the development agenda by building walls and imposing crippling sanctions on others."""
26125	63	On the other hand, sustainable development is not exactly what the G7 is talking about, much less NATO.
26125	65	Seven against the world
26125	67	"The stated aim of the G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps is to ""project unity"" - like the pillars of the collective West (including Japan) united in sustainable and indefinite ""support"" for the Ukrainian state, hopelessly failed."
26125	69	"This is part of the ""fight against Putin's imperialism"", but there is also ""the fight against hunger and poverty, the health crisis and climate change"", as German Chancellor Scholz told the Bundestag."
26125	71	In Bavaria, Scholz has been pushing for a Marshall Plan for Ukraine — a grotesque notion, considering that Kiev and its environs could be reduced to a meager remnant state by the end of 2022. The notion that the G7 could work to “preventing catastrophic famine,” according to Scholz, reaches a paroxysm of ridiculousness, given that the impending famine is a direct consequence of the sanctions hysteria imposed by the G7.
26125	73	The fact that Berlin invited India, Indonesia, South Africa and Senegal as adjunct members to the G7 served as further comic relief.
26125	75	The Tin Curtain rises
26125	77	"It would be futile to expect from the astonishing collection of mediocre ""assembled"" in Bavaria, under the de facto leader of the European Commission (EC), Fuehrer Ursula von der Leyen, a substantive analysis on the breakdown of global supply chains and the reasons that forced Moscow to reduce gas flows to Europe. Instead, they blamed Putin and Xi."
26125	79	"Welcome to the Tin Curtain – a 21st century reinvention of the Baltic to Black Sea Intermarium, masterminded by the Empire of Lies, with western Ukraine absorbed by Poland, the Baltic Three Dwarfs, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Czechia and even Sweden and Finland, NATO hopefuls, all of which will be protected from the ""Russian Threat""."
26125	81	An EU out of control
26125	83	The role of the EU, dominating Germany, France and Italy in the G7, is particularly instructive, especially now that Britain has once again become an insignificant island state.
26125	85	"As many as 60 European ""directives"" are issued every year. They must be transposed into the national law of each EU Member State. In most cases, there's no debate."
26125	87	"Then there are more than 10,000 European ""judgments"", in which the ""experts"" of the European Commission (EC) in Brussels issue ""recommendations"" for each government, directly from the neoliberal canon, regarding their expenditures, their revenues and the ""reforms "" (on health care, education, pensions) that must be obeyed."
26125	89	So elections in every single EU member country are absolutely meaningless. The heads of national governments - Macron, Scholz, Draghi - are mere executors. No democratic debate allowed: “Democracy” as well as “EU values” are nothing more than a smokescreen.
26125	91	The real government is exercised by a group of apparatcik chosen through a compromise between the executive powers, who act in an extremely opaque way.
26125	93	The EC is totally beyond any kind of control. This is how an astonishing mediocrity like Ursula von der Leyen – formerly modern Germany's worst defense minister – was catapulted up to become the current Fuehrer of the EC, dictating her foreign, energy and even economic policy.
26125	95	What do they represent?
26125	97	"From the point of view of the West, the Tin Curtain, with all its eerie Cold War 2.0 overtones, is just an appetizer before the main course: the hardcore confrontation in Asia-Pacific - dubbed ""Indo-Pacific"" - a copy Ukraine's racket coal designed to contain China's BRI and GDI."
26125	99	As a counter-move, it is illuminating to observe how the Chinese Foreign Ministry is now detailing the contrast between the BRICS - and BRICS+ - and the imperial combination AUKUS/Quad/IPEF.
26125	101	The BRICS represent de facto multilateralism, attention to global development, cooperation for economic recovery and improvement of global governance.
26125	103	"The US-engineered racket, on the other hand, embodies the Cold War mentality, exploitation of developing countries, coalition to contain China, and an ""America-first"" policy that enshrines the monopolistic ""rules-based international order."""
26125	105	It would be misleading to expect the G7 luminaries meeting in Bavaria to understand the absurdity of imposing a price cap on Russian oil and gas exports, for example. If that really happened, Moscow would have no problem cutting energy supplies to the G7 completely. And if other nations were left out, the price of the oil and gas they import would rise dramatically.
26127	2	We are not under the NATO umbrella. We are the umbrella of NATO
26127	4	"I apologize for bringing bad news, but to all those who continue to say that they ""Feel Protected Under the NATO Umbrella"" I fear it is necessary to reveal a bitter truth."
26127	6	Dear friends, don't be offended, but you didn't get it right.
26127	8	"We are not ""under the NATO umbrella""."
26127	10	We ARE the NATO umbrella.
26127	12	And in case you are not accustomed to the use of rain covers, I have to remind you that the umbrella is precisely the part that takes all the rain.
26127	14	"So, dear friends, do you really ""feel safe"" thanks to the fact that in Italy we have 60 American military bases with 70 nuclear warheads, enough to wipe Europe off the face of the earth?"
26127	16	Here, take a map. As you can see, Italy is the NATO aircraft carrier in Europe, stretching east towards Russia and south towards North Africa and the Middle East. We are therefore the first line of the front with respect to any conflict in which NATO is really called to act.
26127	18	"If, as usual, it's just a question of dropping a few ""smart bombs"" (and polite) on Libyan or Iraqi or Serbian cities, don't worry, except that we have booked ourselves a place in the group of shameless hypocrites, for the rest we take other risks."
26127	20	But the day in which a real war were to break out, of those for which NATO would have been instituted, the Italian territory, and specifically the US military bases, with attached atomic bombs, would be the FIRST target to be hit, because they represent the first threat against any enemy.
26127	22	"Once transformed into a nuclearized desert, however, we will have the significant satisfaction of having protected, as a valid rain cover, our American ""ally"" at the other end of the planet, who will thus have the time and leisure to alert his own territorial defences."
26127	24	And be glad that American gratitude will not fail to express itself: in Hollywood they will make beautiful films in our memory for years (and there are already those who are whispering about Nicolas Cage as Draghi and Morgan Freeman as Mattarella).
26129	1	China, Covid tracking app used to prevent protests
26129	3	"Dozens of people from all over China had traveled to the city of Zhengzhou to protest the freezing of their savings in four Chinese rural banks. These institutes are controlled by the commercial bank ""Xuchangm"", currently under investigation for alleged corruption of managers. Arriving in the capital of the Henan region Zhengzhou, to protest against the blocking of their accounts, they saw the health code of the Chinese Covid-19 contact tracing app turn red, despite having had no contact with a positive."
26129	5	Protesters were placed under immediate isolation for 14 days. The suspicion is that Henan authorities have abused the covid-tracing system to avoid potential unrest. In fact, the scandal involved hundreds of thousands of people: it is believed that more than 39 billion yuan, about six billion dollars, have been frozen.
26129	7	The Case of Non-Protester Tom Zhang- The owner of a textile company in eastern Zhejiang Province, Tom Zhang was stopped by the Zhengzhou police and held in a local library for about 12 hours. He saw his app code turn red while on a train from a city where there had been no positive cases. “Code red was definitely used to restrict us account holders,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview. He and hundreds of other savers had planned to file a complaint with Henan province's banking regulator on Monday, June 13, after being unable to withdraw their money for months. As he made his way to the airport, his health code suddenly turned green.
26129	8	Covid tracking app, the relatives of account holders are also victims
26129	10	"– It is not known how many were affected, but Chinese reports indicate that the problem has occurred in several towns and villages in the same region. Among those affected, many appear to be relatives of bank customers. ""I'm not a customer, it's my father who deposited money in a bank and now he can't get it out,"" said a woman residing in Zhumadian, a city 200 km from Zhengzhou, taken to the hotel for mandatory quarantine one once its status turned red. “Currently those who have had their code turn red can only contact their community managers to change their status. After taking two Covid tests within three days, their status can be changed again,” said the Chinese health commission official."
26129	12	Violation of the laws – The issue has caused a stir in Chinese social media, where many have pointed out the possible abuse of power by the authorities. “Health codes should only be used for pandemic prevention purposes,” said Hu Xijin, a popular Chinese commentator and former newspaper editor. Using health codes to restrict the free movement of people would clearly be a violation of pandemic prevention laws.
26130	1	Government of the Republic between legitimacy and legitimacy (lost)
26130	3	The 5 Star Movement, with its team of Ministers, is dissolving like snow in the sun despite constituting the relative majority party following the result of the political elections of 04 March 2018. Now, beyond the respect of the constitutional norms on the occasion of the formation of the Conte II (2019) and Draghi (2021) governments and, therefore, of their legitimacy (we remind you that, by Constitution, the Government of the Republic is not elected, but appointed), it is undeniable, after several electoral rounds (European, regional and administrative), that the Executive currently in office is supported by a delegitimized political movement within the electorate and, more generally, within public opinion.
26130	5	"Given this ""huge gap"" that separates political representation and representativeness, we wonder with what courage this government continues to operate. Of course: this is not a legal problem, but a political one and it seems to us that no one (voluntarily and with full conscience) intends to address it."
26130	7	Yet, on the basis of this delegitimization, all the measures we know about the health emergency of national importance were adopted (vaccination, Covid-19 green certification, etc.), it was decided to send arms to the Republic of Ukraine, effectively leading our country to be a co-belligerent when it could have played a role of mediation as Turkey is doing, etc.
26130	9	In the situation described, the President of the Republic (it is a school hypothesis) could also dissolve the Chambers in advance, having consulted their Presidents, pursuant to art. 88 of the current constitutional text, but certainly he will not opt ​​for this solution. This should make us reflect, despite the always open question of the electoral law, both on the possible modification of our form of government (we are supporters of the presidential model), and on the need to build a valid political alternative in the face of the overt failure of the five-year term ( 2018-2023).
26132	1	"Ius scholae? No. For Khaby Lame there is the ""ius Tik tok"""
26132	3	Not only ius soli, ius sanguinis and ius scholae, evolution of the ius culturae. It is always said that Italy is retrograde, that it has no vision of the future... And instead Italy seems to be the first country in the world to introduce the ius Tik tok. Curious, isn't it? During the pandemic, a 19-year-old boy named Khaby Lame is fired (like many) from the factory where he works as a worker and since he cannot look for another job, given that Italy is in lockdown, he decides to try this new social network that everyone was talking about a few months earlier: Tik tok. She has time to waste and it takes. In a few months he becomes popular, his followers grow dramatically and he becomes famous? The reason? Who knows. Lame simply makes fun of web video but the reasons many become known are inscrutable. Sure, he has a marked expressiveness but the virality of the contents often defies logic. And this is an example of that.
26132	5	"Khabi Lame was born in Dakar 22 years ago but has lived in Italy for 21 years. He spent most of his life in our country and attended school here. At 18 he could have applied for Italian citizenship which, after the necessary bureaucratic process, would not have been denied. He didn't do it and it was he himself who explained the reasons just a year ago: ""I'm Italian, I've always felt it. It's not just me saying it. I read: 'Khaby, the most followed Italian in the world'. So I say to myself: see, I'm Italian, I don't need a sheet of paper to know it"". Thus spoke the tiktoker in an interview with the Sette insert of the Corriere della Sera. And yet, the do-gooders didn't like those words. Khaby Lame has been criticized and pressured on social media to take a clearer position in favor of ius alone."
26132	7	"Everything went smoothly until a few days ago. The discussion on the ius scholae flared up and he simultaneously became the most followed tiktoker in the world. And at that moment, as if by magic, a tweet from Carlo Sibilia, Undersecretary of the Interior arrives: ""I wanted to reassure you that the decree granting Italian citizenship was already issued in early June by the Ministry of the Interior. You will soon be contacted by the local institutions for the notification and the oath. Good luck"". Leaving aside the fact that Khaby Lame didn't seem all that worried about not having Italian citizenship, how many other young people does the undersecretary himself write to communicate the granting of citizenship? that then on social networks it was all a ""Khaby Lame must be Italian"" or ""It's a shame that he's not Italian yet"", is another matter. Also because, in spite of the leftist solons who live in a parallel world, the tiktoker already considered himself Italian regardless of the passport."
26132	9	Thinking badly makes you sin, but you are rarely wrong. And the timing of the communication would seem to be on the side of those who suspect that an instrumental use has been made of Khaby Lame. The ius Tik tok has broken down the doors of Italian populism, let's see what other amazing tricks will be found in the coming days.
26133	1	Di Maio also changes his mind on Erdogan: what he said in 2019
26133	3	"There is no doubt that Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio is facing a period of great confusion. After the split with the 5 Star Movement and the march of the ""dimaiani"", who with the new small party to date could probably only count on the vote of their families, for the former pentastellato it's all a run-up after the Premier. It is certainly not a secret or a crime that his positions are aligned with Mario Draghi but, rather, the pretext - probably - to give up that dying movement that has been dragging on for months now without a goal and the drive to create ""Together for the future ”, the new entity made up of 60 parliamentarians – who already want to change the name – even if, at the moment, it does not seem to have a horizon studded with successes ahead of it. But Di Maio seems skilled at mending relationships, breaking patterns, patching up old disagreements: in short, the Minister really seems to be ready for anything out of a lust for power, even denying his own principles by calling into question those decisions taken to protect the country."
26133	5	This happened for the negotiation between Turkey and NATO on the occasion of the decision on the annexation of Sweden and Finland. Critical points are the requests that Erdogan had vetoed the Scandinavian countries: the extradition from the northern countries of those who are considered terrorists and the end of the arms embargo. A very complex choice, if you look at history, but which for European states and for Italy seemed like a walk in the park.
26133	7	At the center of attention are the Kurds who, today, go unnoticed in the run-up to the spasmodic enlargement of a NATO which, blinded by hatred for Russia, always wants more, at any cost.
26133	9	In fact, it was 2019, when the Foreign Affairs Council on Syria and the Kurdish crisis took place in Luxembourg where it was decided to stop the sale of arms to Turkey after the Kurdish forces, in fact, had been involved in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014 , making themselves indispensable for the coalition's offensive against Daesh in Syria.
26133	11	"On that occasion, Di Maio in one piece reassured Italy by stating: ""A very important Council in which the position on Italy's request was a commitment by all European states to block the export of armaments to Turkey because we cannot accept what Turkey is doing. All states condemn what Turkey is doing and all member states have undertaken to block arms exports: this means that Italy will also sign in the next few hours""."
26133	13	It is clear how, at a European level, the Kurdish forces have been abandoned by all the former Western allies during the Turkish military operations in the Syrian Kurdistan region, but even more clear, looking at our home, is the shameful change of Luigi Di Maio.
26133	15	Indeed, just yesterday he issued a statement in support of Turkey, in line with the directives of the last NATO Summit in Madrid where Erdogan, together with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts, confirmed that there are no longer any national arms embargoes.
26133	17	"""Turkey is a key country - says Di Maio - We greatly appreciated the attempts at mediation between Russia and Ukraine and the Ankara summit will also be an important step to encourage dialogue between the parties and restore peace""."
26133	19	A man at the mercy of Draghi, bewildered by his lack of experience but with the cunning to juggle power games: this is how the Foreign Minister appears. And if the Ukrainian conflict arouses more concern every day, looking into our buildings is probably even less reassuring and to understand this, just think of the new friendship with Erdogan.
26133	20	The missiles, for now, remain at the front but the West is full of snipers: everyone shamelessly preparing their own future.
26135	1	The lies of the left on the anti-environment right
26135	3	Francesco Giubilei is the living demonstration of how much a recent joke by the secretary of the Pd, Enrico Letta, represents a dangerous prejudice against those who are not of the left. In a recent interview, Letta shamelessly stated that the left and the right do exist, precisely on environmental issues. And on this nothing to complain. But then he continued: the left makes concrete proposals, such as the cancellation of internal combustion engines by 2035 and has the planet at heart, the right only makes slogans and loves fossils. Nothing more false.
26135	5	Take precisely Francesco Giubilei and his new work, Energetic sovereignty (Giubilei Regnani editore), subtitle. «From the errors of the ecological transition to the war in Ukraine». There is a rich strand of the right, not only liberal but also conservative, who care about the environment, but hate climate change, who think about the future, but without throwing the past in the trash can. Energy sovereignty is a great book and manages to capture even the latest European follies, such as the directives that provide for the death of a piece of European industry, that of the automobile. Giubilei writes: «If Europe does not acquire the necessary awareness that the issue of energy has an impact in every sphere of society, tackling it with a pragmatic vision, it is destined to succumb to other powers, starting from the Asian nations.
26135	7	"In this sense, two concepts such as the ""geopolitics of energy"" and ""energy security"" will acquire an ever increasing weight in the coming years, also in light of the developments of the ecological transition. The choices made in this historical period will influence the following decades and the consequences of wrong political decisions will have an impact not only on citizens and businesses but on the internal Italian and European socio-economic system. This is why we are facing an opportunity from various historical points of view; the possibility of achieving energy sovereignty. If we fail today, we will pay the consequences for decades to come."
26135	9	Yet the political decisions of the European Union continue to go in a direction that condemns us to a loss of autonomy, as demonstrated by the vote of the European Parliament in favor of stopping the registration of cars with internal combustion engines (petrol, diesel and hybrids) starting from 2035. The stated objective is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but the consequences will be devastating from an economic point of view, especially for Italy where there is a strong automotive sector. Eliminating the endothermic engine means bringing hundreds of companies operating in the components and related industries to their knees with serious socio-economic consequences in a historical moment in which the sector is already suffering».
26136	1	The US is throwing its tentacles towards Russia and China through the uprisings in Central Asia
26136	3	“The Hand of the State Department”
26136	4	The influence of Americans in Central Asia is quite large, Boris Volkhonsky, an associate professor at the Asia and Africa Institute at Moscow State University, told PolitExpert. The United States has created a huge number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - this means that they have long been preparing to organize unrest in the region (color revolutions?).
26136	6	“The work of non-profit organizations was started from the very beginning of the separate existence of the countries, after the exit from the USSR. With his denunciation, Lukashenko did not say anything new. The fact that the conflict between Beijing and Washington can erupt anywhere in the world is a fact. All eyes are on Taiwan. But Central Asia also occupies a rather important place in the plans of the West. Especially after leaving Afghanistan. Because this is the closest place: under the belly of Russia and a region close to China. It supplies the People's Republic of China with energy carriers,” stressed the PE interlocutor.
26136	7	Long-term US plans
26136	8	"The United States has long been planning an operation to expand influence and ""set fire"" to the situation in Central Asia, Volkhonsky said. The riots are organized first in one country, then in another. In 2020 they were in Kyrgyzstan, in January 2022 in Kazakhstan, now in Uzbekistan."
26136	10	"“The region is not very stable because it is rather poor. There had never been much wealth there. But there is a great social stratification. The rich are very rich and the poor are practically very poor. The standard of living of the Central Asian elite causes extremely violent dissatisfaction among ordinary ""peasants""."
26136	11	Therefore, there is a social basis for the unrest there. And so – the region is the center of Eurasia. Anyone who has his bases and his influence there will be able to spread his tentacles. In China, Russia and the Middle East. Geostrategically, this is a core region,” the political scientist believes.
26136	12	Protests began in Uzbekistan over constitutional reform on 1 July. It is planned to remove the provisions on the sovereignty of the Republic of Karakalpakstan and the right to secede on the basis of a general referendum from the basic law of the state.
26136	14	Demonstrations in Kazakhstan began on January 2, 2022 after the country changed the calculation of the cost of liquefied gas according to the market. The price of fuel has risen sharply, causing a wave of discontent in Almaty, Aktau, Aktobe. The president made concessions and introduced state price regulation, and on January 5 he dissolved the cabinet of ministers, but this did not stop the demonstrations. Protesters began seizing government buildings, attacking security officials and calling for the resignations of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and former head of state Nursultan Nazarbayev. At the request of the head of state, the CSTO Collective Security Council decided to send a peacekeeping contingent to Kazakhstan.
26136	16	"The notorious Center for Corruption and Organized Crime Research (OCCRP) has released the first part of its investigation into Central Asian countries. Expert and independent journalist Sergei Yezhkov has previously spoken out about who is behind the new ""dumping of compromising evidence"" against local elites."
26136	18	The instigation of riots and riots in the country is increasingly evident. The hand of Washington's services seems equally clear.
26137	1	Young immigrants responsible for one out of two crimes. That's who they want to give the ius scholae to
26137	3	"Young immigrants and crime. While the glittering-eyed local left tries to dish out the law on the ius scholae, ""battle of civilization"", panacea for all social tensions - we have seen, in fact, how the French model has benefited the social tensions beyond the Alps - the Libero newspaper rattles off an exciting series of numbers on crime in Italy and how closely it is linked to the younger sections of foreigners who stay there. Spoiler: minorities bearing cultures of identity and at the same time difficult to assimilate to ours do not come out very well. And certainly giving Italian citizenship to these individuals - without having earned it through a path of ""good citizenship"" - will not mitigate this disconnect from our social fabric and the feeling of aversion towards our culture."
26137	5	Young immigrants and hatred towards Western society
26137	7	"Libero begins with a survey conducted by Ifop for the Montaigne Institute, in which it is estimated that 50% of French Muslims ""aged between 15 and 25 would like to replace the French constitution with sharia"". Numbers corroborated by a further 2018 report presented by the essayist Hakim el Karoui, in which 32% of the students of the Islamic faith interviewed profess an absolutist vision of religion. If you cross the Channel, the statistics do not improve: according to a survey carried out by state authorities in 2018 and cited by the CDDF Foundation, ""23% of English Muslim immigrants believe that sharia should be applied in their communities, while 32% ask for the penalty of death for anyone who offends Mohammed""."
26137	9	Italian numbers
26137	11	We finally arrive in Italy. Before starting, some numbers to circumscribe the phenomenon. According to an Istat survey, immigrant residents aged between 14 and 17 are just 9.6%. Well, in that 9.6% of the population lurks those who carry out 65% of the total muggings (committed in Italy by all residents of that age group), 50.2% of thefts, 48.1% of robberies, 47.7% of sexual violence, 40.4% of beatings.
26137	13	In the age group between 18 and 24 (of which foreigners represent 11.2%) the situation does not improve, on the contrary. 89.7% of crimes involving the exploitation of prostitution, 55.8% of sexual violence, 52.6% of robberies, 52.4% of thefts, 43.6% of intentional injuries age group is committed by immigrants. Not to mention the second generation Italians, who are not included in the research. From the subsequent brackets, the incidence of crime tends to decrease, and this is particularly true in the bracket of immigrants aged between 45 and 54 (11.8% of the population in that age bracket) and later. Perhaps due to greater integration due to a greater period of time spent in our country, the percentage of crimes is around 16.7%.
26138	1	The elections in France and the sensational flop of the parties that govern the EU
26138	3	"To record the sidereal distance between the dynamics of Brussels and real Europe, a macroscopic figure was provided by the French presidential elections. It is a ""lateral"" element, according to most of the information, with respect to the Macron-Le Pen challenge but in reality it says a lot far beyond who will lead the Elysée for the next five years."
26138	5	"We speak of the ruinous implosion of the Ppe and the Pse: represented in the French hexagon by the Republicans and the Socialists. Together, the two parties that ""govern the EU"" obtained 7%: a flop so sensational that only the hasty adhesion of its leaders to the Macronian cause - i.e. the constitutional arc against Le Pen in view of the second round – was partially able to screen."
26138	7	"Yet the evidence cannot be hidden: in the second European power, after Germany, the two ""system"" parties represent practically nobody. Undermined and drained by the technocratic populism of Emmanuel Macron – a bit of the right and a bit of the left: perfect GMO – and unable to reformulate, on the right as on the left, a minimum of political agenda in the face of the excellent performances of Marine Le Pen and of Meléchon or in the face of the arrival of an identity outsider like Zemmour and the first sign of life of the Greens."
26138	8	It will be said: it is an entirely French problem.
26138	10	"Absorbed within its borders and with Macron capable of providing a ""Europeanist"" levee in any case. To a small extent yes. But largely not. Starting from the fact that the Macron operation does not combine perfectly - far from it - with the unionist project and with the molasses of the grand coalition: it is, rather, the attempt of a French enarch - endowed with the right amount of Bonapartism - to occupy the void left by Angela Merkel at the helm of the EU. Leaving aside Macron's dreams of grandeur, the novelty determined by the presidential elections confirms an ongoing trend present in all the major EU and non-EU realities."
26138	12	"It will not have escaped, for example, that precisely in the natural homeland of the ""grand coalition"" - Germany - the Popular-Socialist pact has broken down: with the Populars who have dramatically lost the scepter after Merkel's very long season. Not only that: now the Social Democrats govern with the support of the Greens and the liberals. A very hard blow for the ""immovable engine"" of the EPP: the German CDU. Elsewhere, then, there is no room for scaled-up repropositions of the Brussels alliance: in Spain, for example, the logic of alternation is so deeply rooted that (unlike what happens here) we go back to voting every time that a majority in Parliament is not clear. In Poland and in all the Visegrad countries, then, the stability is ensured by ""conservative"" governments - the majority of which are represented precisely by the ECR plus the former EPP Orbàn - which have nothing to do with the ideological syncretism taking place between popular and socialists: let alone with broad understandings. The same goes – in reverse – in the Northern Nations, where social democracy governs without structural mediation."
26138	13	"So where is the scheme that governs Europe going wrong? As we have seen, in the three main nations: in Germany, with the collapse of the populars, in France, with the disappearance of Gaullists and socialists and in Italy. Already, in the Belpaese broad agreements - a technocratic attempt to borrow the Brussels model without going through the elections - the crisis of the ""Euro-opera"" parties is plastically represented by Forza Italia, inexorably slipping as the third leg of the centre-right, by a Pd that is unable to dictating a real agenda in the progressive camp and by the absolute lack of a structured offer from the centrist bushes."
26138	15	What emerges, however, is the fully bipolar proposal, planted in the field of the government right and recognized by all the most accredited observers as such: that of the Brothers of Italy. It is no coincidence that it is the political force – in the name of the ECR – that works the hardest in Europe to dismantle the EPP-PSE agreement which over the years has led the popular parties to de facto submission to the degrowth and liberal utopianism of the socialists and to the triumph of “woke” fanaticism. The result of this system can be seen in the disaffection, in the abandonment, round after round, of the electorate towards the families of the popular and socialists who claim to represent the European unionist project. The concrete and confederal alternative proposed by FdI on a continental scale, on the contrary, mounts, feeds on suggestions on which it can claim foresight and extensive literature - energy independence, food sovereignty, common foreign policy - and will have its litmus test in Italy .
26139	1	NO VAX OR PRO VAX?
26139	3	It is now a fact that the places available in intensive care in our province are saturated. Serious and alarming news that must raise the level of attention.
26139	4	But the data that makes you angry is that 90% of the seats are occupied by NOT VACCINATED.
26139	5	I know this post will trigger endless comments and discussions, but believe me, without any controversy, the numbers speak for themselves: the vaccine has significantly reduced the pressure on hospitals and intensive care units. No one has ever said that it immunizes us but it is saving the lives of many, which is a precious asset and one to be defended.
26139	6	Let's take our country for example: very high percentage of vaccinations 90 infected 0 hospitalizations.
2614	3	"Open and close. Accepting a few and rejecting many. Inside the Ukrainians (especially the Orthodox ones) and outside all the others (especially the Muslims). It is the Greek model wanted by the very conservative premier Kyriàkos Mitsotakis: the flagship is the migrant camp of Samos, the ""Multi purpose reception and identification centre"", a very selective, certainly very strict ""reception"" structure. Everywhere barbed wire, video surveillance systems, double doors, steel bars, reinforced concrete and scanners. Most of the irregulars (seven out of ten) from neighboring Turkey are concentrated on the small Aegean island. Here it is foreseen the identification, the assessment of the requirements of asylum seekers and the rejection of those who are not entitled. Without appeal."
2614	5	Obviously the NGOs of all latitudes and their reference politicians cry out to the scandal. In their opinion, the camp acts more as a springboard for rejections than as a gateway to the old continent and they accuse the Hellenic police of brutal methods or even of employing groups of migrants as auxiliaries in the hunt for illegal immigrants.
2614	7	"True, probable or false whether the Greek government cares. With the money of the European Union (about 276 million euros…), the government of Athens is now building another four structures (in Lesvos, Chios, Kos and Leros) and is continuing undeterred in its project. ""Our absolute priority is effective border protection"", reiterates the Minister of Migration Notis Mitarakis crunching the numbers: in one year, landings in the Aegean islands have decreased by 96%. In addition, the Mitsotakis government presents the undoubted improvement in the living conditions of the ""guests"" as a success: instead of the miserable slums of the past, today asylum seekers are housed in structures with controlled access equipped with running water, toilets, separate areas for families and greater safety. A way according to Mitarachi to restore ""lost dignity to people seeking international protection and meet the necessary conditions of containment for illegal migrants who must be repatriated"". At the same time, at least as long as the war lasts, doors are open to Ukrainian refugees."
2614	9	"In the background, however, the problem of Turkey remains, for the Greeks a terribly cumbersome and invasive neighbor. It is no coincidence that the border remains deliberately porous, resembling a shutter that lifts or closes according to the fluctuations and internal needs of the Ankara government and in the end everything boils down to a very profitable business. Step back. In 2016 Turkey had signed an agreement with the European Union promising to reduce irregular immigration to Greece (in exchange for money: 6 billion euros, officially to guarantee a welcome to millions of Syrian refugees on its territory). Then in 2020 a new crisis and President Erdogan declared that he was ""no longer available to maintain the closure of the borders with Europe"" given the growing pressure of the masses coming from Asia and Africa. Except then graciously ""accepting"" a refinancing of 485 million euros from the European Union."
2614	11	"In short, migrants cynically employed as a ""weapon of political pressure"" or, if you prefer, as a super ATM. To the point that Greece has repeatedly accused Turkey not only of ""not having done enough to stem the phenomenon"" and has repeatedly documented the bizarre complicity of the Anatolian Coast Guard in the trafficking of the desperate. In turn, Ankara has repeatedly accused Athens of having illegally rejected migrants in an ""inhumane way""."
26140	3	From Calderoli to Zaia, passing through many councilors: those who have a pulse of hospitalizations send the no vax to hell
26140	5	There is a League which, in Rome, is holding back on compulsory vaccination. There is Salvini who certainly cannot be defined as a champion in the awareness campaign in favor of anti-Covid immunization. And which, indeed, with more than a few ambiguous statements, seemed to wink at the vaccine skeptics. And then there is the other League. That of the territories, which every day has to face the bulletin of hospitalizations due to the virus. The one of those who have seen many of their fellow citizens die from the first wave of Covid and have no problem coming to confrontation even with their own party mates. And that of those who know how much the virus can hurt and for this reason try to 'convert' the no vax. Just broaden your gaze a little, go beyond the Council of Ministers and Salvini's statements, to see that this second League is gaining more and more ground. And, even if no one openly exposes himself, he looks at Salvini's line with some annoyance. Too wavering and ambiguous according to those who have understood that Covid must be fought primarily by protecting as many people as possible.
26140	7	In the front row, among the Northern League supporters in favor of the vaccine, is Roberto Calderoli. The vice president of the Senate told Corriere today that he spent the Christmas holidays between the fear of being infected and an attempt to convert non-vax relatives. Five times out of seven he succeeded. “Anyone who persists in not acknowledging reality – he says – I would force him to see what happens in the hospital wards”. A very clear line from him, which certainly clashes with that of those who - with his own card in his wallet - are instead ambiguous or even opposed to the vaccine and the green pass. The most recent example on this front concerns two brothers from Sassuolo, both councilors, both Northern League supporters. They have decided to resign because they are against the vaccine and, therefore, without a super green pass. The choice doesn't move Calderoli one millimeter, who replies: “The world will go on anyway. We will find two more responsible councilors”.
26140	9	To find Northern League supporters who have repeatedly exposed themselves in favor of vaccines - even at the cost of ending up in the crosshairs of no vax - just look at the Regions. Massimiliano Fedriga and Luca Zaia, both leading members of the Carroccio, were at the forefront of the vaccination campaign. “I have an obligation to tell the truth to citizens. I don't have it with no vax but getting vaccinated is the solution. We cannot continue to spread the alibi that this virus is cured at home. That's enough. 93% were treated at home, but without pneumology and intensive care many would have died,” the president of the Veneto region said in December. And this is just one of the many utterances of him that have gone in this direction. Massimiliano Fedriga was no less. The governor of Friuli Venezia Giulia was among the first to invoke a differentiated regime between vaccinated and non-vaccinated, in case the epidemiological situation worsened. As indeed it was then. His exposure cost him the threats of some no vax. And the stash.
26140	11	Understanding why those who administer the territories have a very clear line in favor of the vaccine is quite simple if you listen to the words of Pierpaolo Roberti. Councilor for local autonomy and the public function of Friuli Venezia Giulia, in November he was the protagonist of a question and answer on Twitter with Claudio Borghi, a member of parliament of the League who is very critical of the rules on the green pass. The reason for the clash was the increase in Covid cases in Friuli Venezia Giulia, due to the conjunction between no vax demonstrations and the low percentage of immunized people. Returning to that story, Roberti tells Huffpost: “As from Trieste I can say that the difference in sensitivity on the subject is not only the prerogative of the League. We who administer the territories, however, in addition to having a privileged observatory, have a different role. We are the ones who see the bulletin of infections and hospitalizations every day. And the percentage of vaccinated ”. If you touch things firsthand, if you see the numbers, that's the sense of his reasoning, one can only take one fact for granted: the vaccine reduces serious cases, cuts down on hospitalizations. And if someone is still skeptical on the subject, Roberti replies with the most recent data: “Right now in Friuli Venezia Giulia we have 40 people in intensive care. Thirty-five are unvaccinated”.
26140	13	"The commissioner has repeatedly exposed himself on social media against no vaxes, and does not hide that he has received more than a few attacks: “But I don't even pay attention to it. It's not even worth wasting your time. I am a minority. Very noisy, but still a minority."" In the same way, he is convinced that trying to change the mind of the no vax hard core is now ""a losing battle, fought in the name of what is now an ideology"". Could the extension of the vaccination obligation, which Salvini does not like at all, be a solution? “I can't imagine a real form of obligation - concludes Roberti - and I would like to remind you that the no vax have even accepted to lose their jobs, I don't think they would stop in front of the obligation."
26140	15	In the group of pro vax Northern League supporters there is also the deputy from Bergamo Cristian Invernizzi, the protagonist of a heavy bickering in the Chamber, with his colleague from the Carroccio Golinelli, on the rules on the super green pass. Heard in the following days, he toned down the tone, but reiterated - he who has seen many fellow citizens die and his father feel very ill due to the virus - the importance of vaccines.
26140	17	"That there is a double line, and some annoyance for the positions of the boss, is now evident. But those directly involved are careful not to make it manifest. Also because if you expose yourself too much, you risk disciplinary proceedings within the party. This could be the fate of Giantonio Da Re. Veneto Eurodeputy del Carroccio, on 6 January, in an interview with Corriere, launched a very harsh attack on Salvini: ""The ambiguity of my party and my secretary is putting me at discomfort for a long time. It has always been unjustifiable, now it has become untenable,” he said. And the thud of a stone would have made less noise. The next day Alberto Stefani, commissioner of the Venetian Liga said that he would like to bring Da Re's position before the regional executive. ""Da Re had already been warned - he said, according to what the via Solferino newspaper reports - one does not go out in the newspapers arguing against the federal secretariat"". Everything suggests that all the other dissatisfied with Salvini's line on vaccines will be careful not to use the same tones as the MEP. But the discontent is there. It is enough to line up facts and words to understand that the opposite cannot be said."
26141	1	But science is not a dogma
26141	3	"It's not just typical of No vax rhetoric, many Pro vax are also falling into error. People who accuse the government and science of lying for the simple fact that they have changed their approach as the context has changed. For example: «You said that the vaccine prevents contagion, but instead». True, it had been said. But it was said when the possible contagion concerned the Alfa variant, which in any case, and this was also said, had at least a 10% chance of ""piercing"" the vaccines. And, after the Alfa, it was said for the Delta variant. It wasn't fake, it was real. How true that Omicron is different from the Covid variants that preceded it: in fact, it also infects the vaccinated. It makes them less contagious than the unvaccinated, for less time and almost completely avoids hospitalizations. But it infects them. Is this a sign that governments are lying? Is it proof that science has nothing to do with truth? No, not everything is predictable. Things change, just as scientific evidence changes. The philosopher Karl Popper wrote important pages to clarify how the search for scientific truth consists in the progressive elimination of errors. The assumption is that the error is difficult to avoid from the outset. Therefore Popper argued that in the scientific world, as in everyday life, everything is true until its opposite is proved to be true. This is the liberal method. Why do we Italians struggle so much to accept it? Because we are naturally inclined to a dogmatic view. If we weren't, we wouldn't have been divided for fifty years between the strongest followers of the Communist Party and those of the Catholic Party in the West. Two Church-parties, consequently dogmatic. If we weren't, those compatriots of ours called ""cathocommunists"" would not have considered it natural to add two dogmas rather than eliminate them. There is, therefore, an anthropological fact that explains the reluctance of many to accept the complexity of life and the fallacy of the Word. A certain inclination to messianism, prejudice, conspiracy theory and blind faith follows. The same blindness of those faced with intensive care 80% full of that 15% of unvaccinated fellow citizens find it difficult to sum up. But in this case the harmful effects of a school system not inclined to transmit to the men of tomorrow the rudiments of logic and mathematics of all time are added to the anthropological data."
26144	1	Children safe if parents are vaccinated: new data on Covid
26144	3	The Omicron variant does not even discount children: in January alone, as many as one million newly infected (one in three) are under the age of 18. In addition to vaccinating them directly, it would be good if their parents were also pro vax, the situation would be totally different.
26144	5	What the numbers say
26144	7	"The latest numbers of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità photograph the situation without giving rise to misunderstandings: hospitalizations continue to increase in the 5-11 age group since only 32% were vaccinated with the first dose and 13% with the second. Very low numbers considering that the Pfizer anti-Covid vaccine, for the pediatric range, has now been administered for over a month and a half. In this case, however, there is a combination of faults: many parents who do not want to vaccinate their children are the first to be no vax. In fact, the Italian Association of Pediatric Hospitals (Aopi) observed that, among the very young in the unvaccinated ward (76%), 69% of them had both parents without the vaccine. ""It is very common for father and mother to agree in refusing the vaccine"" even if ""there is no shortage of disagreements in the family. In front of a hospitalized child, it happened that the vaccinated parent blamed the other "", Alfredo Guarino, professor of pediatrics at the Federico II University of Naples, head of the Covid treatment hub of the Naples hospital, told La Repubblica. University and member of the Italian Society of Pediatrics (Sip)."
26144	9	What is family immunity
26144	11	This is not surprising given that statistics have always shown that most infections occur within the home. An Israeli study published in the journal Science confirms the AOPI numbers: the risk of contagion between parents and children under the age of 5 is reduced by 71% if both parents are vaccinated. It's easy to understand: the more barriers the virus encounters (vaccines, vaccines, vaccines), the less it will be able to circulate. Conversely, it is almost impossible to escape Omicron given its rapid diffusion. And then, even in the presence of symptoms, vaccines prevent hospitalization, which has not happened for those children who are now in hospital. After the various herd immunities and innate immunity that we have often talked about on Giornale.it, there is a third type that is talked about too little and it is family immunity, i.e. vaccination coverage for all members of the nucleus familiar (3-4-5-6, etc.), essential to avoid bad surprises due to Covid-19.
26144	13	We treat children of no vax
26144	15	"For many months we have treated newborns of unvaccinated mothers, with very serious consequences. The phenomenon has only recently begun to decrease, underlines Guarino. ""During pregnancy, a woman's immune defenses decrease. Not protecting yourself is a very bad idea"". Not only that: as often happens in the best families, feelings of guilt arise in retrospect for not having been immunized or not having done so with one's children. ""I have seen parents repent once they arrive with the children in the hospital"" she adds, who has recounted sentences such as ""if I had known, if I could go back, I would not have imagined all this"". In short, everything has changed with Omicron and we have known it for two months now: children's hospitals are bursting, for a teenager who enters one leaves because, fortunately, in the vast majority of cases the disease passes thanks to hospital treatment and the less aggressiveness of the variant. ""We treat them in the best possible way, but it is clear that we need to find a different solution"", underlines the pediatrician. The solution to which he alludes is only one: to immunize children between 5 and 12 years of age, who often do not have the power to decide for them. ""The real choice is between getting the vaccine or catching the virus. On the one hand, we have yes and no 10 deaths, perhaps even fewer. On the other, in Italy alone, the victims of the virus are 145 thousand. More needs to be added. ?” he concludes."
26145	1	"Carola Rackete: ""I challenged and won Salvini"" / ""Ramming? Sea Watch was against it”"
26145	3	"Carola Rackete returns to the events of 2019 after the second filing against her: ""I challenged and won Salvini. On the ramming, my NGO Sea Watch did not agree"""
26145	5	"CAROLA RACKETE: ""I WON OVER MATTEO SALVINI"""
26145	7	"He openly challenged him, he opposed him, in fact he ""won"" him but not everyone in his NGO agreed with his actions: the words of Carola Rackete - the former captain of the ship Sea Watch 3 who in the summer of 2019 brought hundreds of migrants rescued at sea to Lampedusa – they remain valid against Matteo Salvini for two main reasons. The political nature of the tug of war held with the Interior Ministry 3 years ago; and also the internal division of the German NGO Sea Watch regarding the famous ""ramming"" of the Italian ship of the Guardia di Finanza."
26145	9	"After the second dismissal of the charges against him - precisely for entering the port of Lampedusa with 40 migrants on board - Carola Rackete tells ""La Repubblica"" all the satisfaction for the political battle completed: ""in the end Salvini lost . We knew when we set sail that the decree had been approved, but we didn't expect to end up in a conflict with the Italian state. After the recovery of the shipwrecked at sea, it was clear that there would be no political solution: everyone was refusing us the port of disembarkation. It was there that I convinced myself that I had to have the courage to challenge your government precisely on the field prepared by Salvini with his decree ». The very little ""nice"" language used against him by the then Minister of the Interior (""German Mint"", ""terrorist"") is today greeted by Carola with very specific political accusations, ""That language of the minister demonstrates how easily one slips from populism towards authoritarianism. Public discourse is toxic against women, against migrants, against young people, against the environment. If there had been a male at the helm of Sea Watch 3, Salvini would not have behaved like this. And I was heartened to know that after my arrest dozens of people protested against sexism."
26145	11	BACKGROUND ON THE RAMMING OF THE ITALIAN SHIP
26145	13	"Against the Italian government and in particular against Matteo Salvini, but in reality also against his own NGO leaders: in the same interview with ""Rep"" in fact Carola Rackete recounts what happened in the dense exchange of messages with Berlin in the ""very hot"" days of the arrival in Sicily after the recovery of migrants in the open sea. «I remember the many internal conflicts at Sea Watch. On the one hand there was me, the head of mission Philipp and the chief doctor on board, on the other the back office in Berlin»; for the former captain, the choice to enter Italian territorial waters and also the forced blockade of the navy in Lampedusa saw her go ""against the recommendations of the back office. We didn't have an established agreement or a common strategy. I made a decision that was opposed by a part of the NGO». Why, however, did it only come to light today that Sea Watch hadn't given the go-ahead for the ""ramming"" of the Italian ship? For Rackete, the reason is very simple: «In public, Sea Watch was on my side and helped me deal with the investigation, but I would have liked Lampedusa's consent too. There was incredible pressure on me and I was the only one able to make the decision. The internal conflicts have been more difficult to manage than the conflict with the Italian government»."
26146	1	Terni, radical left in the streets against Putin, against NATO and against the Draghi government. No to arms shipments to Ukraine
26146	3	The acronyms of the so-called radical left, the Communist Party, the Communist Refoundation, Potere al Popolo, the Cobas, took to the streets in Terni to protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine but also against NATO's interventionism in the East and against the decision of the Draghi government to send weapons to Ukraine. A demonstration was held this afternoon under Palazzo Spada.
26146	5	“A garrison against the war that is bloodying Ukraine but also against NATO because – says Valerio Tobia of Potere al Popolo of Terni – its expansion to the east was one of the main causes of this war and NATO remains a military instrument in the hands of the United States to establish its dominance in the world. United States that played a decisive role in the coup that overthrew the legitimate Ukrainian government in 2014, which had the defect of being pro-Russian. To carry out this coup, the USA did not hesitate to finance openly Nazi gangs. We are also in the square - adds Tobia - to say no to the sending of 3,400 Italian soldiers to the Russian border decided by the Draghi government and to say no to the sending of weapons, voted by the whole Parliament, to Ukraine.
26146	7	"Facts - according to Tobias - that testify to ""the subordination of all political parties to the will of the United States and the European Union""."
26146	9	"""For us - adds the representative of Potere al Popolo - Putin and NATO represent two sides of the same coin, they represent the capitalist system that can only lead us to war""."
26146	11	"Tobias himself called Russia's war on Ukraine ""a criminal aggression"". ""We can say it - he added - not those political forces that fill their mouths with the word peace but then vote to send soldiers and weapons to Ukraine, throwing fuel on the fire for a possible third world war""."
26147	1	The umpteenth penultimatum from Conte to Draghi: “Weapons to Ukraine? We have already given”
26147	3	"Giuseppe Conte asks the government to stop sending arms to Ukraine: ""Italy has already given and now it must be at the forefront of peace"". Draghi will be in the Chamber on May 19 for a report"
26147	5	"Listening to Giuseppe Conte's latest statements on talk shows, it seems that the 5 Star Movement could give the government a break at any moment. And even if President Grillo made it clear last night in Porta a Porta that he ""doesn't want to bring down"" the executive, but that his battle over Italy's position in the conflict in Ukraine is aimed at ensuring that ""the contribution of the 5 Star Movement is respected and listened to and can direct the solutions of Palazzo Chigi”, the formation of an ever wider front among those opposed to the sending of arms to Ukraine increasingly agitates the majority. “After a third decree, do we want to make a reflection? After a third shipment of weapons - which for us must be neither heavier nor more lethal - shall we have a discussion? After the third sending, I believe that Italy has given its contribution. Italy has already given and now it must be at the forefront of peace,” he told PiazzaPulita. In fact, even the League has begun to beat on this point, making Conte feel less isolated. “I would not allow myself to jab at Draghi – added the former prime minister, specifying that he had not ‘made peace’ with the owner of Palazzo Chigi – but I have raised serious political questions on which I am discussing with the relative majority party. In my opinion, after two and a half months, a government of national unity facing a war emergency has a duty to continue to speak with Parliament. We need a political direction, we have to clarify it”."
26147	6	The umpteenth penultimatum from Conte to Draghi on arms to Ukraine
26147	8	"The executive has so far continued to act on the basis of the resolution voted by the majority of the Parliament shortly after the invasion by Russia. “Today – Conte wonders, however – it seems to me that everyone in Italy is starting to think about the possibility that the strategic interests of the European Union cannot be perfectly superimposed on those of the USA”. A ""process of reflection"" is also underway in the Democratic Party: just yesterday Letta met the 5-star leader to try to soften his positions on the government. Government that according to what the Conte himself declared in Piazza Pulita ""goes ahead by itself, deciding from time to time what to do and how to position itself"". To meet the new needs of Parliament, Draghi will be in the Chamber on May 19 for a report, which will therefore not be followed by a vote. The pentastellate parent company in the Senate Mariolina Castellone had asked the premier to express himself through ""communications"", at the end of which - contrary to the information - a resolution is expected. The request did not pass because the other parties, including the League, did not join the queue. A passage with one vote, according to Conte, would have been ""an element of clarification also for the political forces""."
26148	1	All humanity under attack
26148	3	EDITORIAL
26148	5	"Other than «No war, no Nato», as I happened to have to read on a banner circulated in the streets of Parma in recent days. Here the only slogan to shout at the top of the lungs is ""No war, no Putin!"". The frightening images of the gigantic explosions in the capital Kiev and other cities with which the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, subjected to a concentric land, air and sea attack launched from the South, East and North, they already speak for themselves. As well as the figures of the first victims which already number in the hundreds. In his hallucinatory night speech, Putin called it a ""special military operation"". But what is special about this tragedy with unimaginable consequences is only the iron premeditation with which the Russian dictator implemented what he had decided to do for some time. Just seeing him a few nights ago sitting sideways behind the desk while with an air halfway between contemptuous and bored imparting ""his about him"" lesson to the whole world, gave me chills. Dictators, like bosses, have always communicated in the same way. Giving the impression of being recounting something so obvious and banal that it does not allow for doubts or replies of any kind."
26148	7	"«Ukraine is ours, from the Russian Empire!», the former senior KGB official had hissed at the time when the Berlin Wall was still standing and «the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century» (i.e. the collapse of the USSR, again according to him) had not yet been completed. Scanning that face made even more icy by the robust botox injections, the shivers had soon given way to memories and I found myself thrown back into the middle of Georgia in the summer of 2008. Among dozens of burnt and razed villages and rivers of civilians fleeing the armies sent by Tsar Vladimir to ""protect"" the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republics of Ossetia and Abkhazia. It's hard to forget that elderly peasant woman who stared at me silently holding the key to her forever lost house in her hands like a relic of hers. Or the empty eyes of the child destined to become the symbol of the ""Georgia calls Parma"" campaign that I would launch on my return to Italy. Equally indelible is the memory of the interminable odyssey lived with the director of the Georgian Caritas, Father Witold, to reach Gori, the birthplace of Stalin. With the trunk of the off-road vehicle full of baskets of bread for the inhabitants who hadn't touched food for days and the dozen Russian checkpoints passed (goodness them) only thanks to that special ""pass"". Until arriving in the central square of Gori under the huge statue of Josif Vissarionovič Džugašvili: the only one to observe satisfied the carousel of Red Army tanks overloaded with soldiers triumphant for the lightning victory over the Lilliputian Georgian defenses swept away in a handful of days."
26148	9	"Now, however, the gangster scheme used 14 years ago in Georgia by the Russian dictator and replicated with carbon paper in Ukraine (just replace Ossetia and Abkhazia with the two equally self-styled ""republics"" of Donetsk and Lungansk and armed like the previous ones always from Moscow) has turned into the invasion of the second largest country in Europe! And history - the hard, dirty and evil one of bombs and unarmed civilians used as pawns, not the aseptic and nebulous one of analysts who promptly took the place of virologists - repeated itself but this time with enormously larger proportions. Thus putting the West - it is useless to hide it from us - dramatically with its back to the wall. In fact, no one, from Washington to Brussels, from Paris to Berlin via Rome, Madrid and London, is or will be willing to ""die for Kiev"". As for sanctions, it would have been enough to listen to the recent words of the Russian ambassador in Sweden - «We don't give a damn about sanctions!» - to understand that in this damned game the cudgel - that is, the gas and not only that - has been had by the tsar since the beginning. Not to mention the ill-concealed sympathy of substantial sectors of Western politics and public opinion for Putin as dictator as long as you want. But for this very reason capable of being respected and, therefore, even worthy of being admired (just 48 hours ago Trump even called him a genius). Proof that the sinister fascination historically exercised by such characters never dies. Not even to explain and re-explain a thousand times what happened to Europe after British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain let himself be duped by Hitler in 1938 in Munich."
26148	11	Despite that ruinous precedent, in fact the concept that it was better not to pull too much with the tsar has passed. While the catastrophe that has just begun tells us that it was only the eternal self-deception of those who continue to live in a world - the post-Cold War world kissed by the dream of a future without limits of peace, democracy and progress - which no longer exists . Replaced by a world in which modern authoritarian regimes armed to the teeth who have decided to divide it up lead the dance.
26148	13	As they have already begun to do scientifically: Putin with Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and even the Mediterranean now permanently furrowed by the most modern Russian battleships; the Chinese dragon with the rest of Asia and Africa and even with Latin America, waiting (at most for a few years) to dig its claws into Taiwan's back.
26148	15	"Even more so, the comments of those who, even in the face of the terrible spectacle of Ukraine in flames, insist on portraying a China opposed to the Russian invasion are simply pitiful. Beijing hasn't condemned anything, just invited all the parties involved to ""keep calm"": it is difficult to maintain it for the unfortunate Ukrainian people subjected to an uninterrupted rain of missiles and with 200,000 Red Army soldiers stationed on their doorsteps with the order to stay there until they have finished ""denazifying"" the entire country."
26148	17	"In his unbridled display of omnipotence, Putin also threatened to hit ""anyone who tries to interfere in the operations"". A direct threat to America, Europe and NATO. I mean, all of us. As in the film of the Star Wars saga, therefore, the empire has struck again. And by now it should also be clear to the deaf and the blind that he could do it again: tomorrow with the Baltic States also bordering Russia and already members of NATO, or by setting fire to the Balkans, as has already been suggested."
26148	19	"All humanity and not only Ukraine is under attack. The UN said it, Europe and NATO said it, the Pope also said it in his own way with his unheard prayer to preserve the world from the madness of war. In the darkest hour since the end of the Second World War, all that remains is to prepare (if it goes well) for another Afghanistan fought this time in the heart of Europe since the only chance left for the Ukrainians is to fall back on a long and bloody resistance . The damage is in some ways minor, when compared to the immanent risk of a Third World War and a nuclear holocaust. That ""genius"" Putin brought us to this. A genius yes. But bad."
26149	1	Putin is out of missiles. Now Kiev can win
26149	3	"A big bluff that can still hurt. According to Pavel Luzin, Putin's verbal threat of a ""lightning response"" with ""weapons never seen before"" would actually cover up a disastrous situation on the ground: bare-bones missile reserves, serious strategic shortcomings and tired, poorly trained troops , who trudge at the mercy of an increasingly equipped and convinced Ukrainian counter-offensive. But be careful, warns the analyst of the Russian armed forces from Perm: Moscow, if worn out and cornered, could resort to extreme solutions."
26149	5	So Putin's threats are just a bluff?
26149	7	“The possibility of using nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out, but it should not be overestimated. Even if Putin were to give the order, there is no guarantee that the order will be carried out (so, in that case it would mean that he would lose command). Moreover, resorting to the atomic bomb would certainly spell the end of his personal life, the lives of his circle and their families, as well as the end of Russia itself ”.
26149	9	You said that Russia has already used between “80 and 90% of the available medium and long-range missiles”. What does it mean militarily?
26149	11	“It means that Russia is no longer capable of causing strategic damage to Ukraine through conventional missile strikes. However, another bridge or fuel depot hit by another pair of Russian cruise missiles can hardly change the difficult situation on the ground.
26149	13	Is this why Moscow is struggling in the Donbass?
26149	15	"“Russian troops are tired, demoralized and demotivated. In addition to being poorly trained, the truth is that they are simply unable to act faster and more effectively. In practice, they limit themselves to avoiding/preventing the threat of the Ukrainian counter-offensive. However they shouldn't be underestimated, because they can continue to hurt ""."
26149	17	So could Ukraine, increasingly supplied with offensive weapons from the West, have a chance?
26149	19	“Definitely, Ukraine can do it. She can eliminate the threat of Russia in a long-term perspective or even forever and can restore her territorial integrity, if armed by Western allies. Of course it depends on the developments on the battlefield and the internal political situation in Russia. But Kiev can win”.
26149	21	In Mariupol, however, the Russians continue to bomb Azovstal. Exasperated by the Ukrainian resistance could they use chemical weapons?
26149	23	"“Unfortunately I cannot rule out this criminal scenario. However, the price to pay would be so high that I doubt Russia could survive the consequences of this extreme choice."""
26149	25	Fires, explosions, train derailments, suspicious deaths of businessmen. Strange things have been happening in Russia in recent days. What's behind it?
26149	27	“It could be Ukrainian sabotage activities, but also forms of protest by the Russians themselves. Many people are against war, but Russia, coming from a century of totalitarianism, has no tradition of mass political protests. However, it has an ancient tradition of resistance and sabotage from below. Many Russians have their relatives and family roots in Ukraine, so some of them may even have acted in isolation to stir up trouble for the Kremlin. As for the deaths of the oligarchs, it is difficult to say: they could be as much suicides of demoralized representatives of the Russian elite as the extreme measures taken by Moscow against traitors to show others what the price is to pay.
26149	29	And, instead, how do you explain the attacks in Transnistria?
26149	31	"“I don't know how Russia can attack Moldova and think they can get away with it. However, we cannot rule out that Moscow is trying to escalate the conflict by involving other countries. I believe that the incidents in Transnistria are more part of a psychological warfare with which Moscow aims to distract part of the Ukrainian forces concentrated on the southern and eastern fronts, where Russian troops are trying to advance""."
26149	33	When will Putin stop?
26149	35	“Putin's goals have not changed since 2014: a) to destroy the Ukrainian state and national culture; b) disintegrate transatlantic unity; c) create a new global order and rules beneficial to the Kremlin”.
26149	37	To achieve this, could it hit Kiev's supply lines within NATO countries?
26149	39	“An escalation is possible even under the current circumstances. Russia could involve NATO members in a direct confrontation in order to test the ability and defensive compactness of the allies. And, not having many chances to win on the field, she could raise the bar more and more ”.
26149	41	So cornered Putin will use tactical nuclear weapons?
26149	43	"“He could, but without any guarantee that his order will be carried out (the chain of command and control in this case is very complex). Then, in doing so he would also put his own life at risk. Before moving on to nuclear weapons, I think he can attack the Baltic states, Poland and Romania."""
26149	45	Putin is out of missiles. Now Kiev can win May 5, 2022 - 10:36
26149	47	"The Russian analyst Pavel Luzin holds back on the use of the atomic bomb: ""Putin would give the order, but it does not mean that it will be carried out"". But he warns: ""If cornered, he will attack NATO countries"""
26149	49	"A big bluff that can still hurt. According to Pavel Luzin, Putin's verbal threat of a ""lightning response"" with ""weapons never seen before"" would actually cover up a disastrous situation on the ground: bare-bones missile reserves, serious strategic shortcomings and tired, poorly trained troops , who trudge at the mercy of an increasingly equipped and convinced Ukrainian counter-offensive. But be careful, warns the analyst of the Russian armed forces from Perm: Moscow, if worn out and cornered, could resort to extreme solutions."
2615	1	"Salvini-Berlusconi against the ""Amerikan"" Mario Draghi: background, so the war can blow up the premier"
2615	3	One is surprised that the League, with great prudence, and even Forza Italia are distancing themselves from Draghi's flat and indefinite adherence to Biden's strategies. Why wonder? They are pressed by the deep feeling of their constituents. Draghi for them is a lucky accident of history. But seeing our premier wedded by the US democratic president as a perfect ally, to the point of choosing him as the first European leader called with all honors to the White House occupied by the Obamas and Clintonians (May 10), is a bit much. He smacks of servile acquiescence to the I-can-command of an Atlantic Pact whose choices are decided by an Anglo-Saxon summit that doesn't care about our national interest. In fact, the weaker we are, the better off we are.
2615	5	"Obvious: the League moves as if it were walking on eggshells. The accusation of having hidden plots with Moscow immediately jumps out as soon as any of its exponents dare to plead the policy of ""more weapons, more sanctions"" which is the mantra of the ""sincere anti-fascist"". That's why he can't indulge the feelings of his people except at a low volume. This also applies to the Berlusconians, and listen hear - for militants and sympathizers of the Brothers of Italy. The latter certainly don't discuss Meloni's line, they understand the political convenience in terms of future government of the even exaggeratedly pro-Atlantic position decided by Giorgia, but in their hearts they don't believe it one bit. It's a sad price paid at customs clearance. Not that Meloni's tears for the killed children are false. It is another thing to get confused with the single belligerent thought."
2615	7	"Anyone, as it happens to me, receives or explores a chat frequented by the diverse center-right people can only testify to it: the center-right people do not trust Biden at all, they have no intention of being involved in an endless war with the The goal is to unleash the long ""struggle of democracies against autocracies"", as the American president claimed during Margareth Albright's funeral. These non-leftist people are with the Ukrainians, they want to support these poor people, they are in the front line in welcoming refugees into their homes and in supporting the Ukrainian mothers and children who arrive bloodless and afraid among us, but I am against the war where by now the inhabitants of Kiev and Odessa are casually implicated as cannon fodder. And if it goes on like this, in the future we fear we will too."
2615	9	However, there is a mainstream blackmail for which this popular sentiment does not find political leaders who know, indeed can give it political dignity: they would be ousted from the civil assembly whose enclosure was ideologically built by the so-called big newspapers and the news. Fear of anathema. In fact, the thoughts of any center-right MP or executive cannot be found in the aforementioned chats: fear of being associated with those who express their doubts, and therefore of being crucified as cowardly and indifferent accomplices to Putin's brutality. Bales. Those who launch outlandish accusations of pointillism know this very well. People simply do not accept the idea of ​​a military escalation that America and with it Great Britain have: a geopolitical war and supremacy of the Anglosphere of which the threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine is ultimately a mere pretext.
2615	11	"This ""struggle between democracies and autocracies"" looks too much like the one that has produced at least six wars with massacres of civilians, such as the very unfortunate ones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and Libya. First with Bush, who at least had his justifications, and then with Obama, who only had plans to destabilize the Mediterranean and the Middle East to plant his ideological flag there. Those wars have also caused victims and done enormous damage to Italy, and oh well, what has happened. But the one against the ""Russian autocracy"" is a completely different story in terms of risks, even of economic and existential survival of our country. Even a child understands it: it is one thing to bomb an Islamic state, another is to give a mandate to the Ukrainians to fire our missiles against an atomic state."
26150	1	Become a zombie with propaganda: the no war journalist's attack on Russia
26150	3	Marina Ovsyannikova is the Russian no war journalist who presented herself in front of the cameras of the evening news of the Russian state TV Channel One a few days ago with a placard against the war in Ukraine. She was arrested for this gesture but her case raised a huge international case, so much so that the journalist was released after the trial and forced to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles, about 220 euros. This evening she presented herself in front of her cameras Che tempo che lei fa for an interview in connection with Fabio Fazio, during which she did not spare herself and expressed her concerns about what is happening in Russia.
26150	5	Of course I'm afraid, I'm a normal person, a resident of Moscow and I have two children that I bring up alone and I'm more afraid for them than for myself. I fear they may be attacked at school, or on the street, there are people who think differently and I'm afraid, she revealed on Rai 3, underlining that after what happened she was isolated and now she is completely alone. “After this incident on television, no one called me, only one person wrote to me and sent me a word of support, but among the people closest to me, no one called me,” said Marina Ovsyannikova. There is great fear in Russia, dissent is punished with very severe penalties and there are few who have the courage to expose themselves.
26150	7	"Indeed, the situation in Russia is very complex. The country is experiencing one of its darkest moments for 30 years now and the isolation from the rest of the world helps to plagiarize the minds of the inhabitants who are unable to have access to other sources of communication. The results are those exposed by Marina Ovsyannikova: ""According to the latest sociological surveys, 50% of the Russian population supports this war and 50% is against it, and these are independent surveys. But if we look at the surveys carried out by national centres, the picture is different and there is talk of 70% in favor of this intervention, but we must remember that they are people who have been brainwashed by national propaganda"". The journalist then added: ""Now from morning to night we have political shows where Ukraine is spoken ill of and where it is said that this country must disappear. People are 'zombised' by this propaganda"""
26150	9	"In recent days, Marina Ovsyannikova announced that she had quit her job but has publicly declared that she does not want to leave Russia, so much so that she has declined the offer of asylum from France. Inevitable the machine of the mud against her by the Russian disinformation, which now accuses her of being a ""spy"" in the pay of the British. You case that the London government firmly rejects."

26151	9	"The Russians ""are using these words again, 'the final solution', in relation to us, the Ukrainian nation,"" he prefaced. And he adds that the invasion of Russia ""is aimed at destroying the people of Ukraine and that is why it resembles what the Nazis did to the Jewish people during the Holocaust""."
26151	11	"Zelensky increases the dose: the Russians ""use the terminology of the Nazi party, they want to destroy everything. The Nazis called this the 'Final Solution' of the Jewish question"". Hence the exhortation to ""make a choice"", recalling that Israel has not yet imposed sanctions on Moscow or supplied arms to Ukraine."
26151	13	"The Ukrainian president then continues to ask for a meeting with Vladimir Putin and raises his tone, fearing an extension of the conflict: ""We must use any opportunity to be able to speak with Putin. If these attempts fail, it will be World War III. I am ready to negotiate, without negotiations cannot put an end to this war""."
26151	15	"A sign of hope in this sense comes from Ankara, with the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu who made it known that ""the parties are close to an agreement"" and ""the negotiating momentum is progressing""."
26151	17	"Again according to Turkey, the parties are negotiating on six points: neutrality, disarmament and security guarantees for Ukraine, ""denazification"", the removal of obstacles to the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, the status of the separatist region of Donbass and the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014."
26151	19	"The boulders of Donbass and Crimea are the most controversial points, as confirmed by Zelensky himself: ""There are compromises for which we are not ready as an independent state. Every compromise related to our territorial integrity and sovereignty has been made clear by the Ukrainian people"" ."

26154	7	On the one hand there are those who rejoice at the gesture of a few (it is 5 players from a single team) and pretend that it represents the thinking of most of the people who live on planet Earth. On the other hand, there are those who remember - as has already happened in the past - how discrimination is not in line with Christian-Catholic thought and, in some ways, refers to an ideology historically defeated during the Second World War. And so Paola Turci lashed out against the Northern League senator Simone Pillon for one of her social posts.

26154	15	It all started with a social card shared by Senator del Carroccio. A post in which he commented on the decision of some Tampa baseball players to refuse the rainbow logo to take the field during Pride month. And Pillon cheered writing:
26154	17	"“Horn the Tampa baseball players who refused to wear the gay pride logo in the name of their Christian faith. LGBT ideology is radically against the faith, as demonstrated by the blasphemous parades of these days. Opposing the gay agenda is an act of faith. It's expensive, and I know something about it, since I've been on trial for almost 8 years, but it's worth it. Without hating or despising anyone, but faithful to the truth""."
26154	19	The news is real, but it doesn't have the scope indicated by the Northern League senator. In fact, it was only 5 players who play in the Tampa Bay Rays franchise. The rest of the team, on the other hand, joined the initiative – which took place on June 4th – on the occasion of Pride night.

But Paola Turci's attention against Pillon is based not on the news, but on the words used by the Carroccio parliamentarian:
26154	27	"""How unchristian (and very fascist) all of this is, including the manifesto""."
26154	29	The singer, who has always supported the rights of the LGBT community, for this judgment ended up in the crosshairs of Pillon himself who wanted to dedicate another social post to her:
26154	31	“Paola Turci defines me as un-Christian and very fascist for having supported the players of Tampa (Florida) who refused to wear the colors of Gay Pride. By now we've reached the point of absurdity that it's not enough to passively tolerate LGBT vulgarities: it's mandatory to join Pride, under penalty of excommunication reserved for faxists...

26157	1	The homophobia of the patriarch of Moscow has revealed the criminal nature of the Russian invasion
26157	3	Thanks to Kirill, the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Moscow and all Russia, international public opinion has discovered the serious reasons which led Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine with the aim - as they once said - of making a desert and to call it peace.
26157	5	In his sermon at the end of the Divine Liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, the Patriarch indicated, urbi et orbi, the real enemy: the gay lobby.
26157	7	Basically, according to the Holy Man, in the Kiev government there are not only drug addicts and Nazis, but homosexuals (indeed - given the context - let us take the liberty of returning to the decades-old repertoire of Italian comedy: fags, fags, queers , busoni, culatoni and so on), regardless of what has become politically correct in the West of gender identity.
26157	9	"And how would the oppression of the Russian-speaking populations of Donbass manifest itself? With weapons, discrimination, genocide? No; gay parades were forcibly imposed on them, because according to Kirill these parades ""are designed to demonstrate that sin is one of the variations of human behavior""."
26157	11	"""That's why to join the club of those countries (the EU? The Atlantic Alliance? Ed) it is necessary to organize (whether it is a reserved clause of the Maastricht Accords? Ed) a gay pride parade""."
26157	13	Not to make a political statement ''we are with you'', not to sign agreements, but - continued the Patriarch - to organize a gay parade.
26157	15	"“And we know how people resist these demands and how this resistance is forcibly repressed. This means that it is a question of forcibly imposing a sin condemned by God's law, and therefore, of forcibly imposing on people the denial of God and of the truth about him""."
26157	17	We didn't know it, but it seems that in those tormented lands, in the midst of populations all home and family, strictly heterosexual and God-fearing, the Kiev government sent tanks to protect the colorful gay pride parades and forced the Russians to help you helplessly.
26157	19	"""If humanity recognizes that sin is not a violation of God's law - Kirill observed again - if humanity agrees that sin is one of the options for human behavior, then human civilization will end there""."
26157	21	The Russian invasion is therefore not, as we had believed, a question of borders, areas of influence, national security, imperialist vocation but a struggle against the models of life promoted by gay parades. Reading carefully the proscription lists drawn up by Putin, one might doubt that Italy is not included in them for having joined the sanctions and the shipment of weapons to the Ukrainian demo-Nazis-toxic-gay.
26157	23	If the tsar, the new defender of the faith, took advice from Kirill, he could demand from us the commitment - perhaps through an amendment to the Constitution (which by now has seen everything) in favor of the natural family - that Parliament will not never definitively approve the Zan bill.
26157	25	"Was this, perhaps, the promise Putin expected from Mario Draghi's announced visit to Moscow? Western public opinion marveled when Vladimir the Terrible. he spoke of a peacekeeping operation, without realizing that his intentions were precisely to make good customs travel on the tanks and to adorn the cannons with rosaries. And to free Ukraine from sinners against nature, gravediggers of ""human civilization""."
26157	27	Basically a crusade to re-invert – Kirill docet – the inverted. Too bad the devil always sticks his tail in it. In the extermination camps that in the last century a genuine Nazi had scattered throughout Europe, homosexuals were also locked up in addition to Jews and gypsies (and political opponents).
26158	1	The exhibition that recounts the season of Italian bi-populism
26158	3	Italian populism is in a phase of regression. Perhaps it is the Draghi effect, that is, what can be read in the data on the economic recovery, in the numbers of the vaccination campaign against Covid-19 and, from a strictly political perspective, also in the weakening of the populist leaders themselves, who at the last electoral round – that of the administrative ones – have not managed to move the electorate.
26158	5	"When this executive was born, Italy was going through a double crisis: the sudden one due to Covid-19 and the political one that has characterized the last decade, made up of anger against the ""caste"", of shouted sovereignty, of preposterous anti-Europeanisms, of institutions to be opened like a can of tuna."
26158	7	"The fight against Italian populism was expressed in many ways during the two days of the Linkiesta Festival at the Franco Parenti Theater in Milan. Also through photography: last Friday 12 November, at 7 pm, the photographic exhibition ""The Years of Populism"" was inaugurated, a photographic reportage with shots by Gianni Cipriano who put almost a decade of Italian political history into the lens through the faces and postures of Beppe Grillo, Luigi Di Maio, Matteo Salvini and other exponents of Italian populism."
26158	9	"""I wanted to photograph a decade of politics, with its particularities, its protagonists and its exceptional nature, from the growth of the 5-star Movement to the years in which the League was very strong"", said Cipriano, recounting the exhibition and its genesis. A cross-section of Italian history with the rise and - hopefully - fall of anti-system political forces, a time span that goes from the beginning of the 1910s to today. A rather long time in which there were several significant moments to frame."
26158	11	«Over the years – explains Gianni Cipriano – my approach has also changed: between 2013 and 2016 the perception of populism was different, I myself preferred to photograph the socio-economic condition of Italy by looking at the citizens, at their difficulties, and for this was more passion and perhaps even more anger in my work. But at a certain point I thought of turning 180 degrees and looking at the politics that created this condition, and perhaps it was at that moment that I decided to give the project the definitive shape that we see on display today: I turn my attention towards who politics is made not by those who suffer it».
26158	13	"Gianni Cipriano's black and white snapshots alternate shots in a wide field and details, wide angles and minute details. There is Luigi Di Maio's thumbs up and Matteo Salvini is in the crowd, there is a deserted Parliament and Virginia is in the foreground. ""Sometimes a large image - said Cipriano - can allow you to quickly explain an entire day, but in other cases a detail tells a sensation, a moment, a story better than many words""."
26158	15	For the author, this political phase is difficult to understand and explain, but it is not necessarily unprecedented in Italy: «The singular aspect – explained Gianni Cipriano again – is that some particularities of our politics have a sort of cyclicality. There is a parallel with Silvio Berlusconi's entry into the field in 1994, after Tangentopoli and the massacres, then the crisis of the traditional parties and the arrival of a new protagonist who imposes himself and the people who seem to kiss the ground as the new messiah. In the last decade we have seen the emergence of the Cinquestelle and Beppe Grillo, which are in part the result of that culture, of the enhancement of a policy that has less content but more entertainment capacity, the theatrical aspect. So the policy that becomes less concrete and more show.
26158	17	"The exhibition ""The Years of Populism"" is a selection of a larger project, entitled ""Politico"", which tells the story of the latest political season and its distortions through iconic images."
26158	19	The shots are also present in the new issue of Linkiesta Paper on the years of populism (it can be ordered here, it arrives in two days), or it can be purchased at newsstands in Milan and Rome. The leaflet and format of Linkiesta Paper enhance the black and white of Gianni Cipriano's shots, which are accompanied here by an essay by Francesco Cundari.
26159	1	Ukraine can win the war, let's help it now
26159	3	Now that we have helped the heartfelt Ukrainian people not lose the war against Russia, we must help them win it.
26159	5	"To many it seemed impossible that Kiev could resist the invader and now to some it might seem naive to imagine a victory of the Ukrainians against the Nazibol army of the Kremlin. It is not so. Ukraine can win and will win, because the Ukrainians know that, as painful as it is to count every day the number of their heroes who died in defense of their culture (""heroiam slava""), the fate of their nation would be even more dire in the case they let the tanks through with the Russian imperialist Z."
26159	7	They saw it in Bucha two months ago, where the Russians cold-blooded everyone they came within sight of, and in other areas of the south where they launched an obscene de-Ukrainization campaign. Three hundred thousand Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since February 24 to speed up the program of ethnic cleansing and forced assimilation.
26159	9	Above all, Ukrainians have experienced Russian savagery first-hand during more than a century of persecution, repression and starvation planned by successive occupants of the Kremlin.
26159	11	What is certain is that the Ukrainians will fight to the bitter end to stop the Russians from wiping out their culture and their country.
26159	13	Now it is up to America and the countries of the European Union to put them in a position to fight with the weapons necessary to drive the Russians out of Europe's door.
26159	15	If the Ukrainians have arrived this far, despite the delays in delivering weapons, adequately equipped they would be able to face the Russian army more effectively and lose fewer men on the front, contrary to what the self-styled experts of Italian television and newspapers say.
26159	17	After all, the self-styled experts have not got one right on this war or, better, they have always amplified all the facets of Russian propaganda: first they said that Russia had no intention of attacking Ukraine, ridiculing the only newspaper that had written three months in advance (Maurizio Molinari's Republic), then that Putin would conquer Kiev and gut Ukraine in a few hours with a succession of bullshit ever more acrobatically aimed at justifying Russian imperialism and picking on the Americans and treat the Ukrainians who died under the bombing as Nazis or as pawns in a geopolitical game that didn't concern them.
26159	19	And instead, the Ukrainians are anti-Nazi, they are democrats, they are European, they resisted courageously despite the belated Western aid and forced the invader to retreat from Kiev and the north of the country. At that point, the self-styled experts elaborated the thesis, always dear to the Kremlin, according to which Putin's objectives were actually other, more limited ones, or the one according to which the stupid Ukrainian resistance would really anger Putin or that the supply of arms in Kiev would certainly hastened the end of Ukraine.
26159	21	They went so far as to spread false news first about Joe Biden and then about Europe, according to them ready to abandon the people attacked, but exactly the opposite happened: while the experts polluted the Italian political debate even more with their fake news, Biden authorized an additional $1 billion in armaments for Ukraine, and top three European leaders, followed the next day by Boris Johnson, went to Kiev to back Ukraine.
26159	23	In short, Russia has already lost the war and has lost it in a catastrophic way, despite militarily having conquered a few cities in the east and south of the gigantic Ukrainian territory.
26159	25	Putin imagined he would be greeted with roses in the East and put a puppet government in Kiev in a matter of days, but he got stuck in the Donbas because he underestimated the independent spirit of the Ukrainians and underestimated the West's willingness to react. Putin was used to that anti-American scoundrel Donald Trump, who if he had been re-elected, Hillary Clinton told the Financial Times on Saturday, he would have left NATO with many greetings to the Europe we know.
26159	27	Russia has lost the war because it has become the rogue state par excellence, the pariah of any international context, the country to keep away from in order not to be guilty of complicity in an ongoing genocide. Nobody wants to deal with the Russians anymore, except the Italian TVs.
26159	29	Putin will never again be accepted as an interlocutor by anyone in the West, his henchmen have their accounts, properties and yachts blocked and soon also seized and invested for the reconstruction of Ukraine. The Central Bank of Moscow has frozen foreign assets (thanks to Mario Draghi), the European states that depend on Gazprom for energy are equipping themselves with supplies from other countries and with alternative energies to Russian gas (Italy today is already without 50 percent of Russian gas and in the winter of 2022/23, Eni's CEO Claudio De Scalzi told Repubblica delle idee, he will also be able to do without the entire supply from Moscow).
26159	31	Meanwhile, Ukraine has started the formal process of joining the European Union, Finland and Sweden have officially asked to join NATO, while the attempts of Putin's Italian friends to leave the euro, to weaken Europe and abandon the NATO have been foiled, despite resisting in the self-proclaimed independent republics of the 7 and Bianca Berlinguer.
26159	33	Russia has politically and strategically lost the conflict it unleashed, but now it is up to the free world to help the Ukrainians defeat it militarily as well, without worrying about offending Vladimir Putin's susceptibilities or offering him ways out that he does not need since he manipulates internal reality at will.
26159	35	In short, we must help Ukraine even more, accelerating the decision on its entry into Europe and above all by providing all the weapons it needs to repel the Russians and force them to negotiate from a position of weakness.
26159	37	"""Slava Ukraini"", glory to Ukraine, is a very nice slogan to pronounce with a Western accent as a sign of solidarity with the Ukrainian people in the fight against the invader, but to deliver them - immediately, now, today - the tools and technologies to to win the war, to save the country and to defend liberal democracy is the right thing to do."
26159	39	"Saying ""Slava Ukraini"" and answering ""Heroiam slava"" warms the heart, but that's not enough. What Ukraine and the Ukrainian heroes are asking us is «Ne svolikajte!», Hurry up!"
2616	1	Illegal immigration to the rescue: the evil that nobody wants to solve
2616	3	Illegal immigration is a form of slavery. A commodification of human beings with double damage, as by now anyone who is at least sensible should recognize. A direct damage both to the departure populations, who constantly empty their lands of possible workforce, and to those of destination, attacked from practically every point of view (cultural, economic, ethnic) and slowly led to destruction. Of one's rights to work and to the support of the State one belongs to, but also of one's possibility of existing as a community. In fact, extinction would be more correct, if we pay attention to the fact that Italians haven't had children for decades now, but this doesn't seem to matter, because ceasing to exist is a problem only when it concerns others, and not ourselves.
2616	4	Landings tripled compared to 2020, when the rise of a destructive phenomenon that no one really wants to stop had already started again. When someone - like the then Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, without forgetting the already good results of his predecessor Marco Minniti - stops it and reduces it by 96%, it is to be considered an exception. Culturally and even judicially hampered.
2616	6	"We have known the dynamics of what is happening for years. We know of the ""recovery"" of the illegal immigrants already on the Libyan coast (proven by all the salt analyzes carried out at the time by Gefira and relaunched by the youtuber Luca Donadel now some time ago). With the momentary opposition of the Conte I government we know, we know by heart their stubbornness in waiting near the Italian coasts for even weeks in order to necessarily disembark in Italy (cases of Aquarius, Sea Watch, and many others observed in the summers of 2018 and 2019) , despite the alternative proposals of other possible ports (in Tunisia, but also in Spain)."
2616	8	"For years, we have known everything. We know that we are not talking about migrants (a word ""invented"" for the purpose) but about illegal immigrants. And for heaven's sake, we can't even call them that, although they are, and indisputably so. But we don't react. Or rather, a certain political and cultural part that literally has this country in its grip does not react. Not only does he not react, but he encourages."
2616	9	An unheard cry
26161	3	Nicknames, mocking, refusals between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. The Telegram General Svr channel, managed by an accredited former Russian lieutenant, tells of tense nerves between the Russian president and his Chinese counterpart.
26161	5	Today's post reads that the Japanese press confirmed that on June 15, during a telephone conversation, Xi Jinping harshly and decisively refused the invitation of the Kremlin's number one to pay an official visit to Russia in the midst of the invasion in Ukraine: “Although the Kremlin hastened to refute this information, it is the absolute truth. But that's not all, there are other details. Putin has spoken unflatteringly towards the Chinese leader for refusing to help him bypass the sanctions. He also gave him a sarcastic nickname that the Chinese leader has now learned about ”.
26161	7	"According to General Svr, Xi Jinping felt disappointed in Putin and for this reason denied him a face-to-face meeting that was intended to dispel doubts and differences. But the media bomb, the Telegram channel finally releases: ""By the way, the president of Russia also has a nickname, in the Chinese leadership Putin is called 'puppy'"". Truth or propaganda to insinuate suspicions and split the Bear-Dragon front?"

Within a couple of weeks, assures Fabrizio Curcio, head of the civil protection department, a state of emergency will be decreed. This is the time needed, two weeks at the most, to ""clarify the measures to be applied"". ""We are working on it with the Regions which help us understand the measures"" necessary in the most affected areas, he explained in an interview with Sky Tg24. ""Water rationing during the day"" cannot be ruled out, he added. «This year we had to bear 40-50% less water and drought is a widespread problem throughout Italy. We need to understand the measures to be put in place to mitigate it. We are working with the Regions. The state of emergency must be declared after having defined them », he added."

""If the situation goes on like this - said the governor of Friuli Venezia Giulia - a state of emergency will be proclaimed"". Fedriga said he was concerned about the situation in his region: ""I think we have never seen a situation like this here"". The risk of rationalization is real, as explained by Stefano Patuanelli, Minister of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies. «The water resource is scarce and there is a need for conscious and diversified use of water, identifying which priorities are already clearly identified by the law: civil use in the first place, secondly use for watering animals, agriculture and then the industrial part,” he says. The level of the Po is at -3.4 meters compared to the hydrometric zero, over half a meter lower than in August a year ago, with the drought affecting the crops, from rice to sunflower, from corn to soybeans, but also crops of wheat and other cereals and fodder for animal feed, at a time when it is necessary to ensure full production with the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Po appears unrecognizable with a large expanse of sand that occupies most of the bed of the river which is essential for the ecosystem of the Po Valley where due to the lack of water."

""The request we have made is to Switzerland as regards the Ticino and the water that flows from their hydroelectric basins"". Some relief should arrive in the northern regions as early as today. From the early hours, in fact, there will be the passage of a disturbed front that will affect the northern regions and upper Tuscany, with heavy storms, hailstorms and associated gusts of wind. The ventilation, from the western quadrants, will lead to a progressive drop in temperatures, first in the North and, subsequently, also in the Centre-South. On the basis of the available forecasts, the Civil Protection Department, in agreement with the regions involved - which are responsible for activating the civil protection systems in the territories concerned - has issued a notice of adverse weather conditions. The weather phenomena, impacting on the various areas of the country, could determine hydrogeological and hydraulic criticalities which are reported, in a national summary, in the national criticality and alert bulletin which can be consulted on the Department website (www.protezionecivile.gov.it). The warning forecasts from the early hours of today scattered to widespread rainfall, mainly downpours or thunderstorms, even of strong intensity, over the Aosta Valley and Piedmont, extending during the morning to Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano, Veneto and northern Tuscany.

26164	3	An endless question and answer, not only in the military field but also in terms of communication and the media. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky do not seem to want to find common ground. Indeed, they continue in their reciprocal broadsides. In response to the Kremlin leader's speech during today's parade in Moscow's Red Square, the Ukrainian president again compared his archenemy to Hitler.
26164	5	"“Only a madman can hope to repeat 2194 days of WWII conflict”. These are the words spoken by Zelensky during a video shot while walking in the center of Kiev, in which he countered the usual accusations made by Putin on Russian Victory Day. Making matters worse, he then reiterated the disturbing parallel between himself and the perpetrator of the extermination of millions of people during the Nazi period: ""Today he is repeating the horrific crimes of Hitler's regime, following the philosophy of the Nazis and replicating everything they did . He is doomed. Because he was cursed by millions of ancestors when he began to imitate their killer. And then he will lose everything ”. He never mentioned his name, perhaps as a sign of the deep contempt he feels for him. But he still remains very clear who he was addressing."

26165	1	"Salvini attacks the Ius Scholae again: ""True Italians are illiterate"""
26165	3	– Portu Cunnu(Ts) The political controversy over the provision that provides for the acquisition of the right to citizenship by foreign minors who have attended Italian schools for at least five years does not seem to subside. And it is not surprising that the harshest words come from Matteo Salvini, considering that the law would touch on one of the most identifying issues of the League since its inception: fomenting meaningless racism and xenophobia to get more votes.
26165	5	"Salvini spoke on the subject during a rally in Portu Cunnu, a municipality in Trieste, host of the 125th stage of the ""2022 Lammerda electoral tour"", which the leader is carrying out throughout the region, and which will see him reach the record number of 7534 dates , between municipalities, villages, bathing establishments, restaurants, discos and chiringuitos. The Captain dedicated only a short passage to the theme of the Ius Scholae but, thanks to his usual lucid argument, he managed to make it emerge even in the vast sea of ​​sewage that he usually vomits during his public speeches."
26165	7	“The Ius Scholae is just left-wing propaganda and does not solve the problems of Italians. We are in favor of giving citizenship to those who deserve it, without distinction: we don't care which underdeveloped country they come from, or what color their scabies is - Salvini yelled calmly - but going to school, being educated and speaking well Italian are not part of our traditions and our values. True Italians are semi-illiterate back and forth, being ignorant is now in our DNA. Not to mention the Christian roots: Jesus taught us to pray, not to read. If I got to 30% of votes, I'll know what I'm talking about, or not?”
26165	9	The intervention was greeted with the thunderous applause of hundreds of hands without opposable thumbs, and the ovation would have been much more thunderous, if 70% of the sympathizers present had not missed contact between the right and left hands. Also in the subsequent reactions of the main allies, Salvini registers a warm approval, seasoned however with a few digs, to indicate that the well-known discontent within the center-right has not yet been resolved.
26165	11	Giorgia Meloni declared: “On the Ius Soli Salvini is right, on the other hand we at the Brothers of Italy already said these things 300 million years ago, before the great mass extinction of the Permian, also caused by illegal immigration. In those days the trilobites mocked us because of the alleged stupidity of our arguments, today we are happy to see that all the center-right has finally reached an IQ lower than that of arthropods“. The mediation attempt by Silvio Berlusconi is also predictable, as an alternative to the Ius Scholae he proposes the Ius Mammarie for all minors who can demonstrate that they have at least a third of a bra.
26165	13	Gianni Zoccheddu
26167	1	Draghi's bow to the Sultan
26167	3	"Everything is resolved with a bow to the Sultan. “With dictators you have to be frank but cooperate,” Draghi said last year referring to Erdogan and opening a diplomatic case. Since 2021, with the war in Ukraine, the Libyan chaos and tensions in the eastern Mediterranean in the middle, the Italian prime minister has taken a step forward: now we not only cooperate with the dictator, we have become ""friends"" as Draghi said yesterday in Ankara. So also accomplices."
26167	5	Italy and NATO, in order to get Sweden and Finland into the Alliance, have sold out the fate of the Kurds to Erdogan, and yesterday Draghi went to Ankara, in the company of five ministers, hat in hand to ask for support on the gas (Tap and Tanap), on the offshore concessions in Cyprus (obstructed by Turkey) and on Libya, where in Tripolitania Erdogan leads the dance between the factions and Italy with Eni does not extract the oil and gas it would need .
26167	7	"In return we offer Turkey arms - this meant the presence of defense minister Guerini in Ankara - an increase in trade (currently at 20 billion euros) and we are therefore preparing to close our eyes to Erdogan's misdeeds against the Kurds and internal opponents . It would therefore be time to stop raving about ""Western values"", given that we supply Erdogan with Agusta helicopters to strike the Kurds both in Syria and in Iraq. Draghi in Turkey demonstrated Western hypocrisy on democracy and human rights and his visit, preceded by the Madrid agreement, strengthens the regime in its war against the Kurds: a few days ago a Turkish drone killed the commander of the Forces in Raqqa anti-ISIS Syrian Democrats Mizgin Kobane. All this in the silence of that West which just a few years ago acclaimed the Kurds as ""our heroes"" against the Caliphate and posted photos of the Kurdish fighters on social media."
26167	9	It is against the background of these events and the war in Ukraine that Draghi was welcomed to the presidential palace in Ankara with great fanfare for the meeting with Turkish President Erdogan. The Italian premier was preceded by a procession on horseback while the national anthems played. Together with the Turkish president Draghi he walked on a blue carpet escorted by the presidential guard in full uniform to the entrance to the building. Draghi and Erdogan were awaited by a delegation in the costumes of the armies of the 16 Turkish states founded before the republic: in short, a great opportunity for a show marked by the Turkish leader's neo-Ottoman ambitions.
26167	11	"This scenographic apparatus, defined by Draghi at the press conference as a ""warm and splendid welcome"", was certainly not accidental. It served Erdogan to reaffirm his role as Sultan of NATO before an interlocutor with whom he had had acute diplomatic friction which over the last year he was able to smooth out thanks to the common interests of the two countries and above all to the submissiveness of the Italy. Here is an example of how we have already given in to Turkish demands: we recently asked Ankara for permission to exercise with ENI vessels the vested right to drill in the Greek part of Cyprus, which naturally infuriated the Greeks. And yesterday Erdogan did not miss the opportunity to brand ""Greece as a threat to Italy as well"", also referring, among other things, to the dispute over migrants. Statement remained without reply from the Italian side."
26167	13	"Imagine when we will have to discuss the exclusive economic zone drawn up between Turkey and Libya by Erdogan in 2019, who then saved the Tripoli government from the troops of General Khalifa Haftar at the gates of the capital. That Libya where the protests that erupted last ""Friday of anger"" have dramatically put on the international chessboard the risk that the country will sink into chaos and anarchy while the Gaddafis re-emerge."
26167	15	And it is certainly no coincidence that Turkey is always in the midst of mediating between the factions of Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi and Tobruk, where Italy has not touched the ball for some time now. How we are at the mercy of the Turks in this part of the Mediterranean that they consider the Blue Homeland, a strategic concept that from the Aegean Sea, where the Turks collide with Greece, they want to expand to North Africa and even further, to the Gulf, where they their military stationed in Qatar. Too many ambitions? Yes, perhaps, for a country that is also experiencing a severe economic crisis, but Erdogan is also playing a double game in the war in Ukraine, as mediator with Putin and supporter of Zelenski's government.
26167	17	"By comparison, Italy appears very evanescent even if we take a look at what was signed in Ankara in concrete terms: agreements on small and medium-sized enterprises and the reciprocal protection of industrial data. And if there is anything strategic - weapons, gas and maritime borders - it has been left in the folds of the memoranda of understanding. We will probably have more information in the next few days but one thing is certain: Draghi's Italy does not reproach the Sultan of NATO and that title of ""dictator"" that he reserved for him last year will remain as an irrelevant footnote page."
26168	1	"The massacre of Jews and Poles becomes a ""hero"""
26168	3	German journalist Tilo Jung did not have to push hard to get Ukrainian ambassador Andrij Melnyk to give him a detailed version of his thoughts on Stepan Bandera, the nationalist and pro-Nazi leader who eliminated tens of thousands of Jews and Poles with his militias in the Second world War. Last week, when he asked him why the whole world recognizes Bandera's crimes except for Ukraine,
26168	4	"Melnyk replied candidly: “There is no evidence that Bandera's men killed hundreds of thousands of Jews. No evidence. This is a narrative advanced by Russia and supported by Germany, Poland and Israel. I don't know where they got that data, but I'm ready to confront the Jewish community objectively, as long as they don't just repeat what has been said for decades."""
26168	6	"At that point the journalist reminded him of the difficulty one should try to call a murderer of Jews and Poles a ""hero"". Indeed, only on the basis of a childish form of relativism can Bandera be considered a ""hero"" and his followers ""partisans"". But Melnyk once again answered without hesitation: ""Bandera was not a murderer of Jews and Poles."" The interview, which aired on Jung's hugely popular YouTube channel, is unsurprisingly sparking violent protests far beyond Germany, the country where Melnyk has represented Ukraine since 2014."
26168	7	"The Israeli embassy in Berlin called Melnyk's unfortunate words ""a distortion of historical facts, a way to trivialize the Holocaust and an insult to those killed by Bandera"". Furthermore, according to the Israeli embassy, ​​those statements ""undermine values ​​that we all love, and also the courageous struggle that the Ukrainian people face to live in peace"". The reference to the confrontation with Russia is evident and significant in this phase. Melnyk responded almost grotesquely to the note. On his Twitter profile he published two photos in which he smiles alongside representatives of the Jewish community, with a message that says: ""Anyone who knows me knows, I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest terms""."
26168	9	"The Polish government was also tough, asking the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to formally distance itself from its ambassador. A realistic account of the thoughts that pass through Warsaw was provided by the notist Jerzi Haszczynski in the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. ""After the Russian invasion we tried to put aside historical issues that could have damaged relations with Ukraine"", wrote Haszczynski, according to whom ""Melnyk's words cannot be canceled as if nothing had happened: they are a wound for Ukraine at a time of extreme suffering for its army and strong pressure from the West to end this war."
26168	10	Melnyk, according to sources in the German press, could soon be recalled to his homeland. An important position in the ministry would be ready for him. It is not clear in cases like this whether it is a promotion or rather a system to limit his territory. It is true that the aggressive approach with which Melnyk has conducted relations in Germany, in particular on the supply of weapons to the Ukrainian army, has brought him extreme popularity in Kiev. It cannot be excluded that the same is true with the latest and raving statements about the Second World War.
26168	12	"In Ukraine, the Bandera cult definitively emerged from ultra-nationalist circles after the 2014 revolution. So much so that even Melnyk, a refined diplomat serving in the most important European capital, now feels compelled to defend his obscure legacy. This process is undoubtedly amplified by the military invasion that the head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, ordered in February precisely under the pretext of ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Obviously, it would be foolish to think that the war represents a response to the positions expressed by Melnyk and shared by a substantial part of the Ukrainian political class. But sooner or later Europe will be forced to respond to those positions"
26169	1	"Covid, Vaia: ""New Omicron variant punctures vaccines, useless lockdown"""
26169	3	"The new Omicron variant of the covid, more contagious, ""is as if it were a new virus and holes vaccines that are not updated"". The general manager of Spallanzani, Francesco Vaia, says so in an interview with Corriere della Sera. ""The daily bulletin no longer makes much sense, with a positivity rate that marks 13% one day and 28% the next - underlines the expert - It only contributes to creating a climate of alarm stress against the Covid adversary and if united to the fear of war and that of rising inflation, only weakens the immune system"". And the reasons for the increase in cases “are not simplistically attributable either to the rock star concert at the Circus Maximus or to the football match at the Olimpico, to which people are entitled. Anyone who talks about the new lockdown is wrong, the country must go on. And never go back."""
26169	5	"According to the director of Spallanzani, the new leap in infections is in fact due “to the greater contagiousness of the new Omicron variant which is as if it were a new virus and which pierces vaccines that are not updated. The fact remains that it is a fundamental tool to protect against serious forms of the disease“. Don't panic anyway, explains Vaia: ""At Spallanzani we no longer see interstitial pneumonia just as we no longer see young people in the ward"". The hospitalized are “over 70 with comorbidities. Many of whom would not even need to stay in the hospital”."
26169	7	"Vaia then goes on to list the fundamental objectives for the autumn: ""In addition to updating vaccines, we must also focus on concrete responses from the Italian system: first of all, mechanical ventilation in all places of sociality, starting from schools and by public transport. I can't expect to see children in class with jackets for another year because the windows have to stay open. A good mechanical ventilation system is three times more effective than a mask, which has also been a fundamental tool in the pandemic""."
26169	9	"The director of Spallanzani then says he agrees with the councilor of the Lazio D'Amato region, in favor of a lowering of the age threshold for undergoing the fourth dose of the vaccine: ""we must anticipate the virus and not chase it. The frail and the elderly must be made safe as soon as possible with the fourth dose ”. ADNKRONOS"
26170	1	Water emergency? It's also the fault of vegetarians
26170	3	"Science is doubtful. The positive scientific method proceeds from the formulation of hypotheses which are verified on the basis of empirical data. But often methodological positivism does not consider the ""fallibility"" of the premises, the existence of unverifiable postulates and statements of principle, and attributes a scientific value to theories that are not scientific. With the paradox, very Enlightenment, of a science that becomes metaphysics, if not religion."
26170	5	"Climate change or rather the current global climate trend, with the rise in temperatures and the related atmospheric phenomena, is there for all to see. However, the causes are not so clear: ""it is man's fault"", thunders the international environmentalist, from Greta to Pope Bergoglio."
26170	7	"There are many scientists who continue to question themselves, avoiding the comfortable endorsement. According to Antonino Zichichi, ""man affects the climate for 5%: 95% depends on natural phenomena linked to the sun"" and ""it should be noted that climate change and pollution are two completely different things. Binding them means postponing the solution. Pollution can be fought immediately without problems, by forbidding the introduction of poisons into the air. Global warming is something else altogether."""
26170	9	"Another famous physicist, Franco Prodi, goes beyond the anthropic origin of ""global warming"", convinced that ""if we analyzed the climatic history of our planet we would discover that it is made up of continuous changes, even when there was no industrialization""; and again: “at the moment, no scientific research establishes a certain relationship between human activities and global warming. Therefore, to say that we are responsible for climate change is scientifically unfounded."""
26170	11	Leaving aside reflections on large systems, water is scarce in vast areas of the planet these days and, without going too far, it is also missing in our parts. There are many, too many watercourses dried up by the prolonged lack of rainfall, as well as by abuse and waste.
26170	13	The world of agriculture is also in the dock. Consumption and water dispersion are exorbitant precisely in the context of agricultural uses, more than in the civil uses of drinking water. Many experts, including militants of radical ecologism, complain about the spread of intensive agriculture which has also led to an unsustainable waste of water in Italy.
26170	15	"The fanatics of ""green"" alter-globalism take it out on capitalism and the usual ""logic of profit"", but they fail to remember that the free market is governed by a very simple rule: the law of supply and demand. Supply and demand need each other like Siamese twins. And if intensive agriculture is rampant, this means that there is a corresponding demand for agricultural goods, among which magna pars belongs to fruit and vegetables, sacred foodstuffs for health enthusiasts, naturists and, above all, vegetarians."
26170	17	"According to the latest Report on the State of the Green Economy, Italian agriculture is growing, especially in the organic sector which takes up about 15% of the arable agricultural area. However, the ""intensive"" remains prevalent and despite the ""critical consumption"", many vegetarians also contribute to the persistence of forms of agricultural soil exploitation, increasingly dominated by dewatering crops."
26170	19	"In short, we doubt that, beyond those atmospheric phenomena that do not depend on human behavior, the serious water shortage of these days also depends on the ""Friday for future"" activists, perhaps with very ""veg"" eating habits ."
26170	21	"It is worth remembering, not only to them, what the biologist Lierre Keith wrote, a former vegetarian and profound scholar of the perverse link between food and environmental sustainability: ""I have been vegan for almost twenty years, animated by noble reasons and by the desire to save the planet, its wildlife, endangered species […]. I didn't want eating to mean killing animals. […] Now however, I have opened my eyes. And I understood how the life cycle works, and how fair it is, but also cruel. I understood that agriculture, far from being the solution, is the most destructive activity that human beings have imposed on the planet and involves the destruction of entire ecosystems.” In short, water is a precious commodity for man and for his activities, starting with agricultural ones. But a more sustainable use of water resources is also possible by opening one's eyes to reality and overcoming the dogmas and contradictions of the green religion."
26170	23	"Science is doubtful. The positive scientific method proceeds from the formulation of hypotheses which are verified on the basis of empirical data. But often methodological positivism does not consider the ""fallibility"" of the premises, the existence of unverifiable postulates and statements of principle, and attributes a scientific value to theories that are not scientific. With the paradox, very Enlightenment, of a science that becomes metaphysics, if not religion."
26171	1	A 2007 article exposes Greta's climate lies
26171	3	Is global warming really man-made? We re-propose this article by Carlomanno Adinolfi
26171	5	Rome, 7 Oct - Denialism is known, it is an ugly beast. This ignorant and populist habit of pitting scientific data against the messianic faith that was written and revealed only for our good is truly annoying. On the other hand, it is well known that the 500 scientists who write to the UN after Greta's speech are just puppets in the hands of the multinationals. Not like Greta, whose campaign is funded by One, Open Society, Bill Gates, Ebay and singer company only for philanthropic purposes. And let's face it, the 500 scientists have a meager curriculum that didn't pass the Open selections.
26171	7	Rubbia and Zichichi treated like plague victims
26171	9	"Rubbia? Only a politician, he is in parliament (as a senator for life, appointed by Giorgio Napolitano). Zichichi? As soon as he tried, the campaign started to demonstrate that he is a scoundrel and therefore it is clear that in all these years in which we have praised him in the media as a great scientist and the pride of our country, in which we have promoted campaigns to give him the Nobel, I am you are just a blunder. Now it's even the turn of a certain Franco Prodi. Who is he? Only a world-renowned climatologist and physicist, who had the audacity to explain from the pages of the Huffington Post, that Greta's campaign is anti-scientific, that global warming is not caused by man, that climate change is cyclical, have always existed, that there is such a multiplicity of data to consider and that, therefore, it is impossible to make certain long-term predictions, that the most important thing to consider is solar activity and that therefore the entire Fridays For movement Future ""channels in the wrong direction, ie the fight against global warming, what is actually a right urgency, ie the protection of the planet""."
26171	11	The connection between solar activity and global warming
26171	13	But what can an atmospheric physicist know more than a sixteen-year-old girl shouting at the politicians who stole her future? We're not kidding, come on. It is right that anyone who questions the dogma should be pilloried, we are in the 21st century, after all, not in the Middle Ages where the obscurantists and populists want to bring us back. And it would be wrong, almost subversive one would say, to do like the Winston Smith protagonist of Orwell's 1984, who by doing a press review accidentally discovers how the news of the past is simply rewritten or forgotten in the light of the new truth to be spread. And so you avoid looking too far into the past. As for example in an article from August 2007, found casually wandering around that cesspool that is the internet which still can't censor itself via social media, which tells of how NASA has found a warming not only planetary but also globally of Solar System.
26171	15	Climate change on other planets
26171	17	"Is the Earth warming up? Are we noticing increases in temperatures on our planet? Of course, this is impossible to deny. Too bad it is also happening on Mars, whose temperature has risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius in just 20 years against 0.7 in about 150 years on Earth. And on Jupiter, whose temperature in recent decades has started to rise again after a cooling cycle, just as happened in the same years on our planet. But also on Triton, Neptune's moon, whose surface temperature has increased by 2 degrees. Simultaneously with NASA, MIT also collected the same data on Pluto and our Moon. The cause? An intense solar activity, which in addition to global warming also has effects on the increase in rainfall in East Africa and on other episodes linked to the famous ""climate change"". Exactly what scientists say today."
26171	19	But then it was only 2007, Greta was only 3 years old and hadn't yet started dealing with the climate, the new energy transition policies hadn't yet come to fruition and therefore no one had yet in mind to invest in them, the apocalyptic scaremongering the end of the world was still in its infancy and therefore the fact that a new messiah would have saved us by revealing the dogma had not yet been thought of. The funny thing is that the article is from Repubblica, a newspaper that is now at the forefront in favor of the Greta dogma and against denial attempts. And that probably never, ever would publish such a study today. But obviously for our own good, to protect ourselves from denialism and from those heretics who still persist in seeking uncomfortable truths, which came out when they weren't uncomfortable yet. And if the climate is changing on Mars, we just have to invite sixteen-year-old Martians to demonstrate with us against the Western and above all European lifestyle. Maybe even giving them the vote for their civic engagement.
26173	1	"Doctors accuse: ""Migrants come to Italy to be treated for free"""
26173	3	"Italy recognizes a preferential, reserved and exclusive lane for ""foreigners illegally present"" on the national territory, in which treatments and services that Italians can only dream of are guaranteed."
26173	5	"A card (Stp) is enough and the road is paved in accessing the services of one of the best healthcare providers in the world, especially with a ""wide-sleeved"" doctor or the help of more or less ideologically committed voluntary associations. And it's not just about urgent or life-saving interventions, as would be understandable, and in line with oaths and ethics."
26173	7	"It goes much further than ""urgent or essential outpatient and hospital care"", explains the doctor who decides to talk about it. He has had direct experience of it. And he explains what he is talking about: ""For example, a visit to the diabetologist for blood sugar, or chest x-rays, or dental care""."
26173	9	Free prostheses, glasses and all medical aids, not to mention the complete exemption for the purchase of medicines. The card is called Stp (Foreigner temporarily present) and can be requested from any Local Health Authority.
26173	11	The card is valid for 6 months but «renewable. The card can be issued without indicating the name and surname. You don't want to disturb the privacy of the stowaway.
26173	13	"And the Ministry of Health assures illegal immigrants: «Access to health facilities cannot involve any type of reporting to the public authorities. However, keep in mind that in some cases (public order reasons or for other serious reasons) the public authority will be able to obtain the report, as also happens with Italian citizens""."
26173	15	In short, don't worry, dear illegal immigrant, you can get new teeth at the expense of the Italians. And no one will ever sue you. Then, you can go to the Baobab tent city and rape.
26173	17	«Through the emergency room it is possible to access any treatment – ​​explains a doctor -. The acute emergency is guaranteed to everyone, but here we are talking about trivial services, rendered to explicitly irregular people, while the Italians pay for them, or give up having to choose whether to treat one or the other of several pathologies ».
26173	19	“These people have everything – he continues – and many demand it, with arrogance, and doctors generally give everything, so as not to be accused of racism. Appointments, short waits, white recipes, they have understood everything and are primed by voluntary associations».
26173	21	AND HEAR THE TESTIMONIALS OF A DOCTOR IN MILAN
26173	23	Milan 9.30 am cardiology clinic. Two young veiled Egyptian women appear, one of whom is pregnant, who appear at the door of the room with a request for a cardiological visit.
26173	25	"They enter, not a word of Italian, you try to make yourself understood. «Madam, why are you making this visit?». With gestures he shows you the belly and the health card, as well as an identity document with the inscription: family reunification. You try to ask, ""How is he? How long has it been here? Do you take any medicines?' Nothing. With the mobile phone they call a man, according to them the husband who in broken Italian tells you: «My wife is here to give birth». She confirms that ten days after giving birth they came to Italy. And a few months before another visit. Back and forth from Egypt."
26173	27	Another case: an elderly Romanian woman whose daughter has been living in Milan for some years. They discover her mother has heart disease in Romania and take her to the emergency room with us. She is hospitalized with a subsequent cardiac surgery opinion which confirms the indications for an operation. Explain to the relatives that the lady must have the mandatory health card, but they absolutely refuse to go to the consulate because they waste their time there and the file costs 40 euros. The patient is operated on.
26173	29	There are many cases that we see more and more often in our hospitals of people who, in a more or less congruous or cunning way, exploit the so-called folds of the law: if they are here we can't do anything about it, we have to intervene. And what about the ever more frequently used STP codes (temporarily present foreigner, or more simply foreigners not in compliance with the residence permit) that many immigrants use for services?
26173	31	Premise: as a doctor and a Christian I am for solidarity, but I am not willing to close my eyes to the tricks that are now becoming a practice. Because we need to realize that it is no longer possible for our health system to support a workload and expense that increasingly weighs on the coffers of our public service and therefore on our pockets as citizens.
26173	33	Choices are needed to regulate and rationalize all of this, especially in our Region because Lombardy is very attractive for users, but at the same time it sees the waiting lists for our citizens getting longer and longer.
26173	35	"Healthcare workers do their utmost, very often they do much more than what would be in their job description, but the institutions can no longer refuse to put a stop to this ""tourism of childbirth"" or ""tourism of operations"". There is a limit to everything."
26173	37	Stephen Carugo
26173	39	Director of the Cardiology Department of the San Paolo Hospital in Milan
26173	41	When you're in line at the emergency room, when your elderly parent is left suffering for hours on a stretcher, when you need months and months of waiting list to operate: you know who you have to thank.
26173	43	Reunions are a tragedy. Schengen abolishing borders with still second world nations is a tragedy. The abolition of visas with Albani is a tragedy. Because it makes these abuses too simple: why have surgery in Timbuktu, when you can do it for free in Milan?
26173	45	To put a stop to this haemorrhage of resources, the Lombardy Region has intervened:
26173	47	In Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, the Democratic Party does not want to intervene.
26174	1	"Erdogan: ""All migrants want to come to Italy"". Draghi rejoices"
26174	3	"Confirmations arrive from the Turkish front: after Malta, Athens' migration policy is also based on ""refoulements"". «Greece's migration policy is now starting to become a danger for Italy. Irregular migrants now want to take refuge in Italy"". Erdogan makes reality official: the Italian government is the only one that welcomes illegal immigrants. Draghi and Lamorgese have turned us into the dumping ground of Europe."
26174	5	“Migration management must be humane, fair and effective. We try in every way to save the migrants in our seas. Our effort is extraordinary, we are among the most open countries but we must also understand that we cannot be open without limits, otherwise the welcoming country can no longer take it. Perhaps we are the least discriminating country and as open as possible, but we too have limits and now we have arrived there».
26174	7	A moron. It prides itself on being the government that lets foreigners rape the territory. We are the country with the population most hostile to immigration, and the most open government: democracy.
26175	1	"Draghi vs Putin, Meluzzi: ""I'll explain the relationship between Italy and Biden"""
26175	3	"It is an open clash between Italy and Russia after the words of Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Putin's presence at the next G20 in November. ” Vladimir Putin will not come to the G20 scheduled in Indonesia on November 15 and 16 in Bali – Draghi said speaking to reporters at the end of last week's G7 meeting in Germany – Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who organizes the event, he was categorical. What could happen is a remote intervention, we'll see"". From Moscow the reply was not long in coming. “It is not up to Draghi to decide. He has probably forgotten that he is no longer the (G20) president,” Yury Ushakov replied from the Kremlin. On 30 June Joko Widodo, on a visit to Moscow, personally delivered his invitation to Putin, demonstrating that he has no intention of letting the West dictate his agenda. An invitation that has also been extended to Ukraine. Now we have to ask ourselves why Draghi is exposing himself in such a virulent way towards Russia, what interest can he have? Try to explain it Alessandro Meluzzi, psychiatrist, commentator, writer and former parliamentarian."
26175	5	"How do you explain the Italian premier's ""aggressive"" attitude towards Russian president Putin, complete with a request to exclude him from the G20?"
26175	7	"“We have reached the paradox of having a more aggressive Draghi than Biden, and this says a lot about the degree of submission of the Italian premier towards the US president, replacing him and almost becoming a sort of official spokesperson in Europe. In the end Draghi proves to be more realistic than the king. After all, he is playing a role admirably, that of having Italy commissioned, depriving Parliament of power, playing the hawk of NATO and proving to be more pro-American than the Germans, who cannot afford it, and the French who are carving out margins of autonomy. Simply put, Draghi is transforming Italy into what Bulgaria was in the Warsaw Pact. The Bulgarians, who were the weak link in the Soviet bloc, were however sent forward against the Hungarians, the Czechoslovakians, the Poles, in short, they were the ones who in the end acted as hawks on behalf of Moscow""."
26175	9	How do you judge Russia's response that dismissed Draghi by saying that he is not the one deciding participation in the G20? Even more after the Indonesian president personally invited Putin?
26175	11	“I would like to see Draghi decide who can or cannot intervene at the G20. What title does he have to do that? Russia has responded with the obvious I would say and it also seems right to me that Indonesia does not allow itself to be conditioned by Western demands. The role Draghi is playing risks being extremely dangerous for Italy, but also for NATO and the United States, and let us not forget that tragedies like the one in Sarajevo also resulted from attitudes like these ”.
26175	13	What does the fact that in Parliament no one calls Draghi not to exaggerate with provocations that could harm Italy?
26175	15	“But why, is there still a Parliament in Italy?”
26175	17	Theoretically yes
26175	19	"“There are only the remnants of an old legislature that no longer reflect the will of the people. Talking about the existence of Parliament frankly seems to me a utopia""."
26175	21	What do you think of the controversy triggered by Draghi's alleged phone call to Grillo, denied by Palazzo Chigi but which Giuseppe Conte confirms there was, with an annexed request to remove the former premier from leading the Movement by virtue of his positions against the sending of weapons to Ukraine?
26175	23	"“This reconstruction seems credible to me, given that Grillo and Draghi actually already met at the time of Panfilo Britannia. I believe they are related by relationships not entirely known to us. After all, I believe that no one is more willing to believe that Grillo created the M5S out of nothing and against the system. Conte has been placed in charge of what today is only the remnant of a Movement that no longer votes for anyone, precisely because it is organic to the system and contiguous to those powers that he said he wanted to overthrow. The fact that Conte responds to other powers other than those to which Grillo responds shows that there is no longer politics, but only a struggle between opposing groups ""."
26175	25	Can the policy be recovered?
26175	27	"“I'm afraid not, and I am convinced that they won't let us vote before the summer of 2023, until all the issues on the table have been resolved, economic crisis, inflation, appointments, vaccines, war. In my opinion, Italy today is now a commissioned country that no longer responds to any true democratic form""."
26175	29	Meanwhile, NATO is expanding by incorporating new countries ever closer to Russia. What does this mean?
26175	31	"“Which continues the strategy of aggression against Russia with worrying results. Bear in mind that in this match the winners are neither Sweden, nor Finland, nor even NATO. The real and only winner is Erdogan who is proving to be a true statesman right now. He will be able to sink the Kurdish cause before everyone's eyes and we will helplessly witness yet another violence authorized to allow the achievement of Western geopolitical interests. But Turkey must be acknowledged for having been able to demonstrate that it is a sovereign country and of knowing how to defend its interests ahead of everything, unlike Italy which is behaving like the last of Biden's personal colonies ""."
26179	1	Europe's attempt to confront Russia fails and backfires
26179	3	Jul 11, 2022 Europe's attempt to confront Russia fails and backfires
26179	5	Since Wile E Coyote's repeated failures to capture the Road Runner (Bip Bip and Coyote in French), we have not seen a debacle like the one we are currently seeing in the UK and Europe following their ill-fated attempt to destroy Russia.
26179	7	The German economy is on the edge of a precipice. With an economy dependent on imported oil and gas from Russia, German Prime Minister Olaf Scholz thought it would be a good idea to isolate itself from its main supplier. That couldn't be a problem, could it?
26179	9	In the Netherlands, the government waged economic war on its farmers (inspired by the government's desire to go green) and was surprised to find that the farmers produce food. Who would have believed it? Look at the empty shopping shelves in the Netherlands!
26179	11	They wanted to go green but now they are hungry. Apparently, not all food items arrive fully packaged from Amazon!
26179	13	Boris Johnson from the UK (no relation to me) can be counted on to put on the biggest clown show in the circus. The British economy is about to repeat the sinking of the Titanic:
26179	15	“The UK is slipping into a recession. A strong recovery was expected just six months ago, but the impact of the pandemic, the slow return to pre-Covid forms of work and runaway inflation caused by the invasion of Ukraine have depressed the economy. …
26179	17	Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned last week that Britons risk a deeper and longer recession than other major industrialized nations. He also said that inflation would be more severe and harder to control. »
26179	19	Instead of staying at home and at least trying to pretend to deal with growing political problems, Boris preferred to boost his loyalty account miles by multiplying his trips to Kiev to visit his new crush, Zelensky the actor. Boris Johnson's abandonment of the home front came to a head today as he faced a tsunami of resignations from his cabinet. Boris imitated Helen Keller beautifully by adamantly refusing to acknowledge the dramatic erosion of support she enjoyed or listen to calls from his own team to resign. He continues to stagger, at least for now, angry and stubborn. We haven't seen this level of blindness since Hitler holed up in his bunker,
26179	21	According to the press, Boris considers himself a reincarnation of Winston Churchill. This means that we can add one more Self-Deception Medal to Johnson's list of achievements during his tenure. It seems that BJ is guided by one of Churchill's iconic quotes: “This is not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. News flash for Boris: it's the end of the journey. It's time for you to leave.
26179	23	Russia and the war in Ukraine are the leitmotif of the political chaos unfolding in the UK and the rest of Europe. High hopes that harsh economic sanctions would bring down Putin turned out to be the biggest fairy tale of the 21st century. Putin and the Russians are doing very well. It is the Europeans who, as in the case of Wile E Coyote, are destroying themselves.
26179	25	If the European economy buzzed like a Ferrari on the motorway, Europeans, especially the British, would be willing to pass on the lies and incompetence of their leaders. But the Ferrari is out of gas and stuck in the desert. This does not make voters happy and patient. Instead, they tend to get a little restless and unruly when they have to forego dinner.
26179	27	I imagine Vladimir Putin is listening to Sky News, sitting in a big recliner, munching on a bag of popcorn and having a beer or two while watching the show by Boris Johnson, who has been reimagined as the Captain of the Titanic. Boris ties to the mainmast. He will go down with the ship.
26179	29	The deteriorating situation in Ukraine complicates the situation for Boris Johnson. Sir Hew Strachan, in the Daily Telegraph, set the record straight:
26179	31	“But when it comes to Ukraine's real needs, NATO has offered little more than warm words. He then highlighted the deep gaps between the Alliance's understanding of its own security and Ukraine's immediate needs. …
26179	33	Time is not on Ukraine's side. The country is losing lives and undergoes massive destruction: for Kiev the economic costs are greater and more immediate than for Russia. However, NATO behaves as the Taliban have done in the past, as if Russia has the clock but NATO has the time. NATO does not seem to realize that time would be up if Ukraine were defeated before next summer. …
26179	35	By then, at best, the alliance will have provided the Ukrainians with the necessary equipment and training to enable them to mount counterattacks. But NATO's strategy depends on Ukraine's resilience in the coming winter and the resilience of its own constituents. »
26179	37	Here's my prediction: by the end of August, Boris Johnson and Olaf Scholz will no longer be in power and Vladimir Putin will be there.
26180	1	Brussels has to come to terms with reality: it's time to deal with Putin or it will be a recession
26180	3	Now no more joking. The Russian gas cut is about to pass on the cost of the war in Ukraine to Italian families and companies, condemning us to years of recession. This is why it is time to come to terms with reality and not with illusory strategic analyzes based on war propaganda rather than facts. For this reason it is right to ask whether a negotiation with Vladimir Putin is not morally more acceptable than the continuation of a lost war. A war that protracted uselessly will cause further scars of human lives, will accentuate the risk of a world conflict and will condemn Italy and Europe to economic disaster. The three data from which to start are the military, the economic and the political ones.
26180	5	"On the war front, the data is clear, the winners are the Russians and not the Ukrainians. The 150 killed and 800 wounded a day suffered in recent months have deprived Kiev of its best fighters by transferring front lines and logistics to the hands of hastily trained recruits. This, in addition to nullifying the effectiveness of the weapon systems promised by NATO, makes the hypothesis of an offensive for the reconquest of 20 percent of territories already in Russian hands illusory. It is no coincidence that US Deputy Defense Secretary Kathlee Hiks doubts Kiev's ability to resist ""for five or ten months""."
26180	7	The economic reality is even more painful. While Moscow bears the sanctions without disabling consequences, Italy and the EU suffer the boomerang effect. While Jp Morgan already sees the price of crude oil at 380 dollars a barrel, the governor of Bank of Italy Ignazio Visco foresees two years of recession in the event of a total cut in Russian gas. Two years that would throw our companies on the pavement, facilitating the penetration of a China ready to establish itself as the real winner of the Russia-NATO confrontation. Not to mention the migrant risk. The wheat crisis moves hungry masses from sub-Saharan Africa to Libya and heralds massive exoduses towards a beautiful country that already hosts 145,000 Ukrainian refugees.
26180	9	"On the political front, the unsustainability of the conflict is even more evident. The specter of a defeat in the mid-term vote in November on the wave of energy costs and inflation is cracking Joe Biden's determination. All while London, Paris, Rome and Berlin are facing crises capable of making the Ukrainian challenge irrelevant. And Germany hints at breaking the blockade of sanctions in order to guarantee itself Russian gas. Precisely for this reason, a wise old man like Henry Kissinger should be listened to, convinced of the need to deal with the Kremlin by the end of July, that is ""before insurmountable tensions and uprisings arise"". If we don't negotiate now, he seems to be saying, it will be difficult to do so when, having conquered Donbass, Putin will look to Odessa, putting us in front of an even more devastating crossroads. On the one hand, the hypothesis of stopping it with direct intervention. On the other, that of bringing us to Europe a defeated Ukraine, economically bled and condemned to live on our aid."
26182	1	Russia counts its allies
26182	3	"Since the end of the Cold War, there has never been a more delicate moment in relations between Moscow and the West, with the US and the EU continuing to ""provoke"" Russia diplomatically, militarizing Ukraine despite not being part of NATO - and asking Putin instead to withdraw troops from its national border -, insisting on political/economic sanctions and despising the Kremlin's peace proposals."
26182	5	Moscow for its part, if on the one hand it does not give in to bullish provocations, on the other it is strengthening its alliances with anti-NATO countries, in view of a war that it will not be the one to start but from which it will certainly not back down.
26182	7	This is when the alignments begin to emerge more and more.
26182	9	Lukashenko, president of Belarus, wanted to clarify his position in the speech to the nation and to the Parliament given yesterday:
26182	11	"“Will there be war or not? Yes, there will be but only in two cases: if Belarus suffers direct aggression or if our ally, Russia, suffers direct attack […] For the West, it is important to drown the Russian-Ukrainian brotherhood in blood, we are fraternal Slavic peoples, we come from the same baptismal font. Our roots go back centuries and this must be preserved, whatever the cost. Our unbreakable bonds are the foundation of our safety and survival. We will return our Ukraine to our Slavic brotherhood."""
26182	13	Signs of military cooperation are also arriving on the Moscow - Havana axis, with the Russian ambassador to Cuba who in an interview with RIA Novosti said:
26182	15	"“Military cooperation with Cuba is proceeding actively and does not depend on the situation, new contacts are expected in the technical-military sphere. The deployment of military infrastructure in Cuba is a sensitive subject, we cannot make it public""."
26182	17	"Meanwhile, since yesterday Moscow has banned several European Union officials from entering the country, some of whom are ""personally responsible for spreading anti-Russian policy"" in the West."
26183	1	How Brazil is saving the world from a catastrophic food crisis
26183	3	The author of the article, Augusto Zimmermann, is professor and dean of the Faculty of Law at the Sheridan Institute of Higher Education in Perth. He is also president of the Western Australian (Wa) Legal Theory Association and was a member of the Wa Law Reform Committee from 2012 to 2017. Zimmermann is an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame in Australia and has co-authored several books, including Covid-19 Restrictions and Compulsory Vaccination: A Rule of Law Perspective (Connor Court).
26183	5	Brazil is the fourth largest food producer in the world and is completely self-sufficient in basic food products: it ranks as the world's leading producer of bananas, cocoa, cassava, coffee, corn, rice, soybeans and sugar. And while most of these products are consumed domestically, a considerable proportion are also exported, including oranges, palm oils, garlic, peanuts and tea, but much more besides.
26183	7	However, the problem is that Brazil needs a constant supply of fertilizers to fuel its powerful agricultural industry. And the country's largest international fertilizer supplier is Russia, accounting for 44 percent of the total used by Brazil each year.
26183	9	"Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said his country would remain neutral. Bolsonaro met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on February 16 and on that occasion he declared: «We are eager to collaborate [with Russia, ed] in various fields. Defense, oil and gas, agriculture. Brazil is in solidarity with Russia."""
26183	11	As can be expected, this visit to Russia was heavily criticized by the US government because it came amid Western tensions with Russia over Ukraine. However, Bolsonaro has not backed down.
26183	13	The Amazon is a huge bank of infinite natural resources for Brazilians. It has the most significant percentage of fresh water, precious minerals and oil globally. Unsurprisingly, global elites are appealing to environmental issues in a bid to undermine Brazil's sovereignty over the region. In reality, environmentally protected areas in Brazil amount to an impressive 25% of its entire territory, 50% of which are in the Amazon alone. However, we constantly see a disinformation campaign about the deforestation of the Amazon.
26183	15	On the other hand, it is also true that Brazil has yet to import 97 percent of the approximately 10 million tonnes of potash it uses annually for agricultural production, making it the world's largest importer. So, the fundamental question is: where could Brazil get more fertilizers from?
26183	17	Potash reserves in Brazil are mostly found on its indigenous lands in the Amazon region. According to Márcio Remédio, director of the Geological Survey of Brazil, a state company of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, “These reserves are world-class. They have the potential, if not more, than those of the Urals produced by Russia and Belarus, and also Saskatchewan in Canada.
26183	19	"Only 3 percent of Brazil's indigenous lands are deforested – a lower rate than public and private lands. The Brazilian Constitution defines indigenous lands as those traditionally occupied by Brazilian Indians, as well as ""those used for their productive activities, those indispensable for the conservation of the environmental resources necessary for their well-being and their physical and cultural reproduction, according to their uses, customs and traditions"". . So broad is this description that a prominent constitutional law professor, Manoel G. Ferreira Filho, quipped that it would be easier if the Constitution defined what land non-Indians could occupy."
26183	21	Federal law in Brazil authorizes the exploration of mineral wealth in indigenous lands. A share of the profit must be transferred to the relevant indigenous community occupying the region, which cannot be removed from the ground except in extraordinary cases of catastrophe or epidemic. Even so, these Indians retain the right to return to the land as soon as the risks are over.
26183	23	By making a deal with Russia, Brazil has prevented the extraction of potash that could harm the Amazon and violate indigenous rights; even if it could potentially save the world from a catastrophic food crisis.
26183	25	“If Brazil were to downsize next year due to a lack of fertilizers, it would definitely be bad news in the event of a global food crisis,” says Joseph Schmidhuber, an economist who has studied the impact of conflict on food, for l 'Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
26183	27	The war in Ukraine, combined with economic sanctions from the West, has put world food security at risk. These sanctions were meant to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but they are seriously jeopardizing the world's ability to feed itself.
26183	29	"In this vein, the Brazilian government recently presented a critically important proposal to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which excludes fertilising products from any sanctions imposed on Russia. Brazilian Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias called on countries to find an international solution to the problem, warning that a shortage of fertilizers would cause ""food inflation and potentially undermine food security""."
26183	31	To conclude, the Brazilian government has not only averted a food crisis by replenishing the country's stockpiles with Russia's help, but has also played a leading role in finding international solutions to an emerging food emergency which, at worst hypothesis, it could see millions of people die of hunger, especially in the poorest countries.
26183	33	That being the case, the world should hope that President Jair Bolsonaro is duly re-elected by Brazilians in the upcoming presidential elections in October this year.
26184	1	'Russia's international isolation has failed'
26184	3	02 Mar 2022 “Russia's international isolation has failed”
26184	5	Why did the West fail when it tried to isolate Russia?
26184	7	MOSCOW, March 1, 2022, RUSSTRAT Institute.
26184	9	"One of the elements of the information confrontation between Russia and the collective West is the myth of the ""international isolation"" of the Russian Federation. Communicating with people who are under the influence of Western media, as well as with their domestic clones – foreign media agents, one often hears the phrase: “The whole world is against us”. How true is this thesis? Are we really “condemned by the entire world community”?"
26184	11	"In answering these questions, we must remember that in the propaganda lexicon of our opponents, the ""world community"" is understood exclusively and only as the collective West. And today he is the one who insults Russia and acts in the best traditions of a shitty racket of the 90s. The West closes the skies to Russian aircraft, freezes Russian foreign exchange reserves and expels our athletes from the competitive space. But the rest of the world watches the West's actions with mixed feelings: from ill-concealed surprise to harsh condemnation."
26184	13	China has expressed full understanding of what Russia is doing now. In the statements of Chinese officials, the culprit of the drama unfolding in Ukraine is clearly indicated - this is the United States of America.
26184	15	"The Indian authorities speak more cautiously, but also refuse to join the initiatives of the West and vote against the anti-Russian resolutions at the UN. In the country, thanks to which mathematics and chess appeared in the world, they are well aware that global security is impossible without Russia. Delhi is also aware that all attempts by proper leaders, the West, politicians and military to build a dialogue with Russia are blocked by the global ""deep state""."
26184	17	The last episode unfolded before our eyes. The commander of the German Navy, Vice Admiral Kai-Achim Schönbach, was ousted from all posts in disgrace after his speech in India, where he spoke about Russia's role and importance.
26184	19	Solidarity with Russia has been expressed by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Even under former US President Donald Trump, the conservative Bolsonaro was led by the United States and considered Washington to be his main ally. But after the Democrats came to power, he became disillusioned with America, which was destroying traditional values, and started paying more attention to the BRICS format. His support for Russia at this dramatic moment is the symbol of the radical change taking place in Latin America.
26184	21	The leader of another largest Latin American country, Argentina, also refused to condemn Russia. He recalls how Great Britain, with the support of the United States, occupied part of its territory, the Malvinas Islands (Falklands). President Alberto Fernandez, in defiance of the West, demonstrates his willingness to develop relations with the Russian Federation, he was one of the first to sanction mass purchases and the use of the Russian Sputnik vaccine.
26184	23	"Probably the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf, which are the richest and most technologically advanced part of the Islamic world, do not consider themselves part of the ""world community"". At a meeting of the UN Security Council, the UAE also refused to condemn Russia and vote in favor of the anti-Russian resolution on Ukraine."
26184	25	Finally, Israel clearly does not want to take an anti-Russian position, which has become a world leader in innovative technologies in recent years. The Jewish state treats the Ukrainian regime with ill-concealed disgust, as it considers the executioners of the Jewish people, Petlyura and Bandera, its founding fathers.
26184	27	"And this list of countries is far from exhaustive. Therefore, it was not Russia at all that ""isolated itself"", but it was the collective West that found itself alone in its pathological hatred of Moscow. The rest of the world – the world community without quotation marks – continues to regard Russia as its full member."
26184	29	We must now be realistic and realize that many of the opportunities for economic and humanitarian partnership with the West that existed before have been closed today for a long time, if not forever, and through no fault of our own. However, at the same time, both new options for cooperation at the international level and new options for Russia's development are opening up.
26184	31	The modern West is only a small part of humanity. Its monopoly on cutting-edge technology, not to mention cutting-edge ideas, is a thing of the past. We must move forward and seek our place in the future, which no longer belongs to the West.

26186	9	The President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, President Ramaphosa, President Bolsonaro, Prime Minister Modi, ladies and gentlemen,
26186	11	To begin with, I would like to join the previous speakers in thanking the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping and all our Chinese friends for their proactive efforts this year to promote our strategic partnership within the BRICS.
26186	13	The countries that make up this group have sought to intensify their cooperation on all global and regional issues. The BRICS format has steadily increased its international prestige and influence. This is an objective process, since the five BRICS countries, as we all know, have immense political, economic, scientific, technical and human potential. We have what it takes to work together and deliver results to ensure global stability and security, sustained growth and prosperity, and improved well-being for our peoples.
26186	15	I think the theme of today's meeting, “Promoting a high-quality BRICS partnership, ushering in a new era for global development”, is very relevant. Considering the complexity of the challenges and threats facing the international community and the fact that they transcend borders, we need to find collective solutions. The BRICS can make a significant contribution to these efforts.
26186	17	We have repeatedly stated that challenges such as conflict resolution, the fight against terrorism and organized crime, including the criminal use of new technologies, climate change and the spread of dangerous infections, can only be tackled through joint efforts.
26186	19	And, of course, it is only on the basis of honest and mutually beneficial cooperation that we can look for a way out of the critical situation that has arisen in the world economy due to the thoughtless and selfish actions of some states which, using financial mechanisms, they are effectively offloading their macroeconomic policy mistakes onto the rest of the world.
26186	21	We are confident that today, as never before, the world needs the leadership of the BRICS countries to define a unifying and positive path for the formation of a truly multipolar system of interstate relations, based on the universal norms of international law and on the principles key to the United Nations Charter. In this context, we can count on the support of many states in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which are trying to pursue an independent policy.
26186	23	I am confident that, as per tradition, the current BRICS Summit will be substantial and effective and that we will be able to hold a frank and detailed exchange of views on all major global and regional issues and on the various aspects of the strategic partnership, including in the format of expanded BRICS+ dialogue.
26186	25	Let me emphasize that: Russia stands ready to continue promoting close and versatile interaction with all BRICS partners and contribute to strengthening the group's role in international affairs.
26186	27	Thank you for your attention.

But what are you talking about! They are incompetent, crazy and dangerous."
26187	1	Brazil: no to sanctions against Russia, or there will be world hunger. The real economy beats the paper one
26187	3	The blockade of Russian exports also risks having heavy falls in world food levels, above all because they are linked to an essential agricultural product such as fertilizers.
26187	5	In response to World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's call on Brazil to increase food exports on Tuesday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro asked the WTO not to disrupt trade flows with Russia . He said that there are 27 Russian ships carrying fertilizers to Brazil, essential products for South American agricultural production.
26187	7	Now, why would Bolsonaro go against the wishes of US and EU politicians to eliminate trade with Russia, causing among other things a worldwide famine?
26187	9	Well, the South American country imports more than 85% of its fertilizer demand. Russia is its main supplier and Belarus supplies 28% of the total.
26187	11	Limiting the consumption of fertilizers would be absolutely disastrous, reducing crop yields and threatening global food security. The country is a major exporter of coffee, sugar, soybeans, cassava, rice, corn, cotton, edible beans and wheat.
26187	13	This is further evidence that G-20 countries such as Brazil, India and China, widely known as the BRICs, are ignoring US pressure to stop trade with Russia. Many of these countries depend on Russia and Belarus for raw materials. In one graph, here is Russia's commodity reach:
26187	15	The rebel G-20 countries imply that the old economic order, in which the dollar's centrality in global trade remains king, is fading. Numerous countries are already operating outside the dollar system because Western sanctions have isolated Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. This gave rise to commodity-based currencies.
26187	17	If the United States and the West really wanted to go back to being central to the world economy, they would have to stop dealing only with banks and finance, and also go back to being producers of raw materials on a large scale. The real economy should be relaunched against the paper one and the mountain of blah blah products from Brussels. Obviously the elites will oppose this transformation in every way.

26188	1	The tentacles of NATO from Europe to Latin America
26188	3	Strategika - The Beginning of the End for the Ukrainian Army?
26188	5	Often, and understandably, international analysts are asked whether there will be a change in US foreign policy depending on whether a Republican or a Democrat president rules the White House. Given that, for a Marxist, it is always good practice to avoid Manichaeism and look at the concrete situation in its historically determined class relations, to point out that, at the international level, the essence of US foreign policy does not present effective discontinuities, it is not a ideological stance.
26188	7	"""Everything changes so that nothing changes"" is a scheme that fits well with US strategy in the world. Whether it is cloaked in a free-range Trumpist rhetoric or a more persuasive Biden-like ""multilateralism"", the founding idea of ​​armed supremacy remains at the basis of the US political model in the world. A paradigm that feeds on and nourishes the interests of the industrial military complex, supported, relaunched and updated by its ideological engines, schools of thought and the media."
26188	9	On this basis, the US believes itself to be the gendarmes of the world, legitimized in an arms race to protect itself from an everlasting danger, both within and in its own areas of influence, which therefore are teeming with military bases with stars and stripes. An apparatus that needs, from time to time, to put itself to the test, to demonstrate to the allies-subjects that it is worth paying to guarantee peace through the vicarious prestige of that armed supremacy.
26188	11	"On this basis, the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the confrontation with an economic and thought model that placed peace with social justice at the center and could thus also inspire the pacifist demonstrations against the aggression against Vietnam, the North American war adventures, moved by reasons of internal politics, have consolidated the consensus of the elites around the concept of North American ""democracy"" as a vaccine for the world: leveraging on the double key of military and economic supremacy, but if necessary also on a presumed moral and cultural superiority capable of coagulating globally consonant interests."
26188	13	A concept increasingly questioned by the growth of a multicentric and multipolar world, crossed by a globalization that weaves interests between divergent poles, as can be seen in Latin America where China has solid commercial relations even with far-right governments like the Brazilian one. On the other hand, it can be remembered that the technical-scientific cooperation pact with Argentina, which led to the establishment of a radar station in Patagonia, signed in 2014 by the then president Cristina Kirchner and then confirmed by the entrepreneur Mauricio Macri, friend of Trump, who succeeded her to the presidency, dates back to 1980, when the anti-communist military dictatorship was in government.
26188	15	In any case, if one year after the assault on Capitol Hill the structural flaws of US bourgeois democracy have highlighted the crisis of US hegemony also in terms of their ability to attract, the United States is still the leading world power, well supported by an alliance, that of NATO, with new expansion plans.
26188	17	We are seeing this with the new conflict in Ukraine and with the failure of the meetings that took place in Brussels between Russia and NATO. The Atlantic Alliance, which is preparing the June summit in Madrid, Spain, has rejected all of Moscow's proposals to contain the expansion of North American supremacy eastward, which the accession of Ukraine, the last nation to ask for it, would dangerously expand . In thirty years, the number of NATO member countries has grown from 16 to 30, many of which belonged to the former Warsaw Pact.
26188	19	The allies of these 30 countries are now deployed along the Russian borders, but Putin is once again being accused by bombastic Western propaganda. The media, however, are careful not to disseminate the contents of the dialogue platform and the draft treaty, proposed in December by Moscow, and rejected by Washington. All the points put forward by Russian diplomacy concerned a peaceful settlement of the disputes, the commitment of the two parties not to undertake actions harmful to security, to guarantee respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter by all military organizations and alliances to which Russia and the United States accede, and not to use the territories of other States to organize or carry out an armed attack against either side.
26188	21	"Russia also asked the United States not to establish military bases on the territory of other states of the former Soviet Union that are not already members of NATO and to avoid further accession of former Soviet states to NATO. This being the case, the Russian diplomacy said, ""if there is not at least some margin of flexibility on serious matters"", Moscow ""sees no reason"" for new meetings with the United States and their allies."
26188	23	"The Atlantic Alliance said it was available for other meetings because ""the risk of an armed conflict in Europe is very concrete and it must be prevented"", and in the meantime it has moved all the European pawns to support the thesis according to which Putin would like to invade Ukraine and would use gas, through the state-owned Gazprom, as a political weapon in ongoing disputes with Western countries."
26188	25	"""The risk of war in the OSCE area is higher than in the last thirty years,"" said the current President of the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, in opening of the OSCE Council, which includes 57 countries, including the United States, Ukraine and Russia. ""There will be no negotiations on Ukraine under military pressure from Russia"", said the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, referring to the Russian troops present in Crimea."
26188	27	"Meanwhile, a group of 25 Democratic senators, led by Bob Menendez, has presented a bill on the ""Defense of Ukraine's sovereignty"" in the event of an attack by Russia. The plan includes sanctions against Putin, the premier, military officials, and executives of the banking sector. Sanctions against a head of state - commented the Kremlin spokesman - are a measure equivalent to a break in relations, ""they would go beyond a limit""."
26188	29	"US Senator Menendez, who chairs the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is known for spearheading campaigns against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. In 2019, he pushed for then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to apply sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua over their relations with Russia. In December 2021, he made Biden sign the Ley Renacer, to tighten sanctions on Nicaragua, ""guilty"" of organizing the presidential elections on November 7, 2021, won again by the presidential ticket Daniel Ortega-Rosario Murillo."
26188	31	The senator also worked to ensure that the unilateral coercive measures were also adopted by the European partners of the United States and Canada and were accompanied by other sanctions of an economic nature, aimed at reviewing the loans granted to the Nicaraguan government by international organizations and at reconsidering the participation of the Nicaragua to the free trade treaty which unites various Central American countries to the United States, the first world power and the first market for Nicaraguan exports.
26188	33	The elections in Nicaragua and the participation of Latin American countries in President Ortega's assumption of office have also been the subject of friction within CELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States which includes 33 American countries (32 since Brazil of Bolsonaro withdrew), except the United States and Canada. On 7 January, the body's summit focused on the resumption of continental integration, despite the differences of views that move the right-wing governments subordinate to the USA, was held in Buenos Aires and attributed the pro-tempore presidency to 'Argentina.
26188	35	"Nicaragua's initial opposition to Argentina's candidacy has receded thanks to the mediation of Cuba and Venezuela. The Sandinista government had protested because, on November 8, the Argentine government had issued a statement calling for a boycott of the ""fraudulent elections"" in Managua and, on November 13, it had then endorsed a draft resolution at the Organization of American States (OAS). , wanted by the United States and 8 other countries. Then, however, the government of Alberto Fernández had decided to send its ambassador back to Managua, who was also present when Ortega took office, and the conflict had subsided."
26188	37	"The Celac summit, which once again raised its voice against the illegal unilateral coercive measures, also denounced how some of the countries present, Colombia in the first place, were there on behalf of third parties, ie on behalf of the United States. Colombia, which is teeming with US military bases, has joined NATO since 2018 as a ""global partner"", effectively breaking the declaration issued in Havana in 2014 by the continental body, which declared CELAC a ""peace zone"" ."
26188	39	By joining the Atlantic Alliance, the Colombian government (before Manuel Santos and now Ivan Duque) has effectively paved the way for any NATO maneuver both from its coasts in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and from the borders with Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador and Panama.
26188	41	"At the Buenos Aires summit, the representative of Colombia defended the role of the OAS and criticized the ""dictatorships"" of Ortega and Maduro. “We believe that multilateralism offers the best choices,” she said referring to US policies. Then, shamefully keeping silent about the massacres that take place in the shadow of the Colombian narco-government, you reaffirmed the importance of respecting human rights in the region and maintaining good relations with the United States and Canada."
26188	43	"Venezuela, through Foreign Minister Felix Plasencia, reiterated the proposal to create a general secretariat of CELAC ""to give even more impetus to trade between all the countries of the region"", and supported Argentina's claim against the International Monetary Fund to get rid of the debt contracted by the previous Macri government. The summit proposed 15 points to work around in the following months. These include the post-pandemic economy, space cooperation, educational integration, institutional strengthening and the fight against corruption."
26188	45	"""Let's make a clean slate and open a new file, and let's go forward dear Nicaraguan brothers, building peace to fight poverty, building peace so that there are roads"", Daniel Ortega said in Managua as he assumed his fifth term as president, after being was elected with 75% of the vote. A further step towards the strengthening of the Bolivarian Alliance for the peoples of our America (Alba-Tcp) and of Petrocaribe, in the framework of counter-hegemonic relations that design a multicentric and multipolar world."
26189	1	You quoque Iran! Putin risks being abandoned even by Tehran
26189	3	In the vote of the UN General Assembly which yesterday condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine, only five countries expressed themselves in favor of Moscow. In addition to Russia, Syria, Belarus, Eritrea and North Korea voted against the resolution. Not exactly heavyweights on the international chessboard. There are dozens of allies, friends and clients who have turned their backs on the Tsar; the defection that must have made Vladimir worry the most is not so much that of his former friend Bolsonaro or of China, which is trying to meddle as little as possible in the conflict, but that of Iran.
26189	5	"Ah yes, the Iran of the ayatollahs, America's sworn enemies, whose foreign minister tweeted as soon as the first tanks had crossed the borders of Ukraine denouncing the ""provocation by NATO"", in the end abstained, leaving my friend Vladimir more and more alone."
26189	7	"The reason for this about-face could be traced to a piece of news that has not circulated so far, namely that the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi will be in Tehran on Saturday ""for meetings with senior Iranian officials"". Officially the talks only serve to resolve some controversies on Iranian nuclear activities, but the legitimate suspicion arises that the West is thinking of bringing Iran (and its almost infinite reserves of gas and oil) on its side, leaving Putin without the only weapon of deterrence it can play against Europe. Atomic aside, of course."
26189	9	"Since Donald Trump imposed very heavy sanctions against Iran, effectively eliminating exports of crude oil to the ""free world"", the country has only been able to sell to China, exploiting its resources far below its possibilities. Things could change right now that the rogue state par excellence has become Russia, and it seems that Europe is already ready to ""forgive"" Iran in the name of the holy alliance against the Russian despot."
26189	11	"For example, Chancellor Scholz has already flown to Israel - for obvious reasons the country most concerned about a rehabilitation of the Shiite regime - to explain that an agreement on nuclear power must be found as soon as possible. An agreement could in fact convince the Americans to cancel the sanctions, ""liberating"" the enormous Iranian gas reserves, the second in the world. If this were to happen, it would be a very heavy blow for Putin, who just over a month ago welcomed Iranian President Seyed Ebrahim Raisi to Moscow to establish the contours of a strategic cooperation agreement that was supposed to relaunch trade between the two countries. The problem is that Iran and Russia have very little to exchange, being two petrostates whose economies depend almost exclusively on the export of energy sources. The meeting served more than anything to create the basis for an anti-Western axis, but it is possible that the Western Euros (and dollars) can convince the Iranians to immediately renounce the agreement with the Russians, who from a financial point of view have very little to offer, especially now that over half of central bank assets are frozen."
26189	13	If the betrayal were to occur, Iran would become, even in the long run, Russia's natural commercial adversary on the very rich European market. The bill for the Ukrainian adventure is getting more and more salty.
26190	1	"China Daily: ""Economic Pain Coming to Europe"""
26190	3	Strategika - The Beginning of the End for the Ukrainian Army?
26190	5	"Since January 2, our Facebook page has been subjected to an unjustified and grotesque block by ""fact checkers"" belonging to newspapers competing with us. Help us get around their censorship and subscribe to the Telegram Channel of the AntiDiplomatic"
26190	7	I am publishing an article that appeared today in China Daily on the economic impact of the Ukrainian conflict for the EU. The picture that the Chinese analyst gives is devastating. I invite you not to watch TV or read newspapers, we have been very weak for 30 years because we have destroyed the internal market and we continue thanks to exports, not having raw materials.
26190	9	The Chinese analyst subtly underlines it between the lines, does not put a knife in the wound, perhaps out of respect or diplomacy, but has a precise picture of the situation.
26190	11	Yesterday the economist Guido Salerno Aletta posted this note on FB: “The West, the USA and the EU, is the real Comecon… a closed economy, one of underdevelopment. The USA has a net external debt of 13 trillion dollars. They import in debt, they produce nothing but services, they depend on China for all manufacturing. Europe has no energy independence and survives only with exports to the USA, China and Russia. The BRICS are complementary economies, which need neither the dollar or euro. They have raw materials, land, manufacturing, population and consumption capacity.”
26190	13	You will not find these words in any European media, all silent. I know of very worried entrepreneurs, as well as analysts, but they are silent, they don't want to expose themselves, they are waiting for events, for example the American Mid Term. Yesterday at the UN China and India abstained on the resolution deploring Russia. Brazil is missing (for the BRICS), but Bolsonaro is there. But Pakistan also abstained, four days ago it signed an agreement with Russia for a gas pipeline. A world that emerges, another world that sinks. To suffer the consequences are the populations, European, and by this I mean also Ukrainian and Russian. Western imperialism does not want to pass the hand, or at least, coexist with other actors who are now very strong. A rabid dog, therefore dangerous. But let's read what they think about our economy in China. Enjoy the reading.
26190	15	----------------
26190	17	Economic pain coming to Europe
26190	19	According to analysts, the European economy could bear the brunt of the spillover effects of the Ukrainian crisis in the form of even higher energy prices and reduced business confidence. Tian Dewen, deputy director of the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the world is a global village where countries are economically interdependent and any crisis that occurs can affect the lives of people everywhere. An immediate impact of the Ukrainian crisis is the blow to Europe's economic recovery against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The impact of a conflict or firefight between Russia and Ukraine is bound to ripple across Europe and beyond, with knock-on effects on the global economy,” Tian said. Russia is the world's third largest oil producer and one of the world's leading exporters of natural gas, while Ukraine is the world's leading food exporter.
26190	21	Russia accounts for about 40% of the European Union's natural gas imports and about 30% of its crude oil imports, according to Eurostat, the bloc's statistics agency. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Russia's largest banks and its elites and have frozen central bank assets held outside the country. They also took action to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, the payment system used for most international financial transactions. Tian said energy problems will directly affect European countries, given the dependence of many of them on Russian supplies. Ukraine is a major transit hub for Russian oil and gas. Austria, Italy and Slovakia import natural gas from Russia, mainly transported via Ukraine. Some of the natural gas supplied by Russia also reaches Germany and Poland via Ukraine. Energy prices have soared over the past year in Europe and the Ukraine crisis will make matters worse, Tian said. “For many countries, it is difficult to find alternative energy solutions in the short term,” she said. Tian said that a feature of the EU economy is that, for the most part, its raw materials are supplied from outside the bloc and local capital- and technology-intensive enterprises are concentrated. Furthermore, its markets lack growth momentum and many of the region's products have to be sold outside Europe. “That is why uncertainty in the world economy will have a greater impact on the EU economy,” Tian said. “Soaring energy and raw material prices and supply shortages, as well as global supply chains that have not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, are all negative factors for the recovery of the European economy ”.
26190	23	Corporate confidence: Tian said investors and capital generally avoid exposure to conflict, and uncertainty will hurt business confidence and consumption. This would have a big impact on the European economy, he added.
26190	25	Chen Fengying, senior researcher on the world economy at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that considering the EU's dependence on Russian energy, there are indications that Western countries may not touch the energy sector in their actions against Fly. But the Russia-Ukraine conflict will further fuel inflation in Europe. Aside from energy bills, food prices look set to soar, Chen added. Russia and Ukraine together account for 25 to 30 percent of global wheat exports and about 80 percent of global sunflower seed shipments, according to London-based consultancy Capital Economics. Chen said many countries are already paying higher prices because of the conflict. Within the EU, Germany is likely to suffer the most. Its economy is growing more slowly than many other EU countries. Germany is sticking to a plan to phase out nuclear power this year and has relied on Russian energy. But on February 22, the country announced it would suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is worth about $11 billion. Chen said that if the conflict in Ukraine eases soon, there are grounds for optimism that its economic effects will gradually diminish.

26192	1	"Coronavirus, Bolsonaro: ""Many people die in Italy because it is a country of old people"""
26192	3	"Coronavirus, Bolsonaro: ""Many people die in Italy because it is a country of old people"""
26192	5	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro recently commented on the coronavirus emergency underway in Italy, highlighting the high percentage of the elderly population in Italy.
26192	7	The nationalist leader stressed the link between an aging population and the spread of the coronavirus during a recent meeting with green-gold journalists, focused precisely on the measures that the government of the South American giant would soon put in place to combat Covid-19 . The conservative president himself, in recent days, underwent the anti-disease test as a precaution, which then revealed Bolsonaro's negativity to contagion. However, just this Tuesday, Brazil had to mourn its first victim of the pathogen that is bringing the international community to its knees.
26192	9	"Speaking during a press conference held in Brasilia, the green-gold head of state, SkyTg24 reported yesterday, tried to dilute the growing concern of his compatriots regarding the spread of the indicted disease in the Latin American country. In fact, he tried to reassure local public opinion by stating that the epidemic would mainly affect ""old"" nations, such as Italy, according to him."
26192	11	Bolsonaro, quoted by the broadcaster, then stated: “Italy is a city… a country full of old men. In every building there is at least a couple, as in Copacabana. For this reason there are so many deaths ”.
26192	13	The president, reports AdnKronos, later added: “The elderly have other diseases, but they say they die from the coronavirus. The coronavirus that comes to an end does not kill them, those people are already debilitated ”.
26192	15	The attempts of the conservative leader to play down the coronavirus bomb, combined with his propensity to accuse anyone who denounces the danger of the pandemic as hysteria and to criticize the Brazilian governors and mayors who have introduced restrictive anti-contagion measures, are not arousing, according to SkyTg24 , great popular consensus.
26192	17	"For example, last Tuesday, according to the same television network, the citizens of many large cities in the country launched a curious protest initiative against the head of state: throwing pots off their balconies, symbolically against the exponent nationalist, shouting ""out of Bolsonaro""."
26192	19	"The exit of the green-gold president on Italy as a ""land of old men"" immediately provoked strong criticism from the politicians of the Belpaese. One of these, i.e. Andrea Romano, deputy of the Democratic Party and member of the Foreign Affairs commission in the Chamber, addressed the following harsh words to Bolsonaro, also reported by SkyTg24: ""We wish our Brazilian friends, even those of a certain age, not to never go through what Italy is going through. But we demand that the Brazilian presidency respect Italy and its suffering, refraining from delusional and offensive statements such as those of Bolsonaro""."
26193	1	Russia-Ukraine war: Bolsonaro's Brazil remains neutral. But the president is pro-Russian
26193	3	“We want peace and we don't want to attract negative consequences for us. For this reason, in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia we will help according to our possibilities in search of a solution“.
26193	5	"These are the words of the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro who declares his neutral position on behalf of the country. The far-right head of state also stressed that Brazil ""depends a lot"" on Russian fertilizers."
26193	7	Questioned during a press conference in Guaruja, in the southeastern state of São Paulo, he reported a conversation with Putin that lasted more than two hours. “I spoke to President Putin recently about many things. Of course he said something about Ukraine, but I'm keeping it to myself without going into details,” he said.
26193	9	Relations with Russia therefore need to be protected. Just three days ago Bolsonaro claimed for himself the exclusive right to express the country's position on the crisis in Ukraine. The declaration had come following the criticisms of his deputy, Hamilton Mourao, against Moscow.
26193	11	“Whoever talks about these issues is only the president, and the president is called Jair Messias Bolsonaro – said the head of state -. It is not his responsibility ”.
26193	13	Bolsonaro's clarification, repeated several times during the live broadcast, accentuates the distance with Mourao, already excluded from his re-nomination for the role of vice president in the October elections.

26194	3	"Rome, 21st April. The ""very cordial"" meeting between Matteo Salvini and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Urbán ended after an hour. The conversation took place at the Hungarian Academy in Rome. It was an opportunity, explains the League in a note, above all to take stock of the international situation also in the light of the Ukraine crisis and after the meeting between Orbán and the Holy Father. Salvini ""congratulated the prime minister for the recent electoral success and above all for the words of Pope Francis who praised Budapest for its commitment to welcoming Ukrainian refugees"". The leader of the League underlined ""the appreciation of his own party for the Pope's wisdom, in particular with regard to the invasion of Ukraine to urge an end to the conflict"". Among other things, Orbán illustrated his economic policies at protection of families and young people, with targeted loans for those who have children and tax advantages. Salvini recalled that there will soon be administrative elections in Italy and, in a year, the policies: ""I am convinced that the center-right will win,"" he said. The head of the Foreign Affairs Department was Lorenzo Fontana with the Northern League secretary. Salvini highlighted the ""total harmony"" with Orbán as regards the fight against illegal immigration, the need to reduce the tax burden for families and businesses, to work on a European centre-right project that is clearly an alternative to the socialists, to ""defend the values ​​and the roots of the West"". The League reaffirmed the feelings of friendship that unite Italy and Hungary and which - according to Salvini - will have to foster ever greater collaboration also on the front of international cooperation."

26195	5	The M5s is finished. Mannheimer, the poll-shock: here's where they collapsed (and who takes their votes). Here everything changes
26195	7	Reality is debunking a dominant thesis of the progressives at the helm of the mainstream media, namely: the Russian invasion of Ukraine will knock out the nationalist right in Europe. For years Le Pen, Salvini and Orban have been playing the useful idiots of the evil dictator Vladimir Putin - so the reasoning goes - and now they will pay the price. Unfortunately, by progressives we mean, they are not paying in any way. On the contrary. The European nationalist right, or populist if you like, is doing better now than before the war. This truth didn't stop Francis Fukuyama, the American historian famous for having mispredicted the end of history in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, from proclaiming on his American Purpose website: «The invasion has already caused enormous damage to populists around the world.
26195	9	"Joe Biden, the ""hysteric"" who can blow up the world: ""Putin more lucid than him"", who sinks the president"
26195	11	"Let's go back to the real world... In Hungary, Viktor Orban - according to the first electoral data - is heading for re-election for the fifth time. In France, Marine Le Pen (20%) is closing in on Emmanuel Macron in the polls (28%), despite a photo in her election brochure depicting her with Putin in 2017. In Italy, Fratelli d'Italia remains at the top (21, 5%) and the League despite Matteo Salvini's pro-Putinian t-shirts is in stasis but always in third place. The nationalist right - more or less - has historically backed Putin because he saw him as an ally in the existential war to defend the Judeo-Christian world from the threat of both progressives and globalists as well as Islamists. Of course, she doesn't see it that way anymore. But it remains unharmed primarily because the Russian invasion of Ukraine reveals the difference between bad nationalism (the imperialist one of Russia) and good nationalism (the patriotic one of Ukraine). The bad nationalist wants to impose his way of life on third parties - the good nationalist wants to defend them from third parties. The courageous patriotic resistance of the Ukrainian people has transformed the word ""patriotic"" from an ignoble thing into a noble one."

26195	21	"In short, this war brings the raison d'être of patriotic parties such as the Brothers of Italy and the League back to the center of the political stage. Second, the war reveals the dishonesty of the media (almost all abroad if not in Italy) when every time they talk about a nationalist party they label it ""anti-immigrant"" or ""anti-refugee"". Nope! These parties are insisting on taking in Ukrainian refugees. For one reason: there is a big difference between Ukrainian refugees (almost all women and children) and African ""refugees"" (almost all single men). Poland has taken in 2.3 million Ukrainian refugees - half that. This government has granted all these refugees the right to welfare, health services, and schooling. Pure Orban has taken in more refugees than any other country except Poland - 350,000. Therefore, it has now become somewhat forced to portray Polish and Hungarian nationalists as xenophobes who close their borders to refugees when reality blatantly denies it. As Giorgia Meloni told Corsera: «The images of women and children who flee tell what real refugees are (...) Instead we have been told the tale of the drama of alleged refugees... of boats full of men looking for a job"". We are witnesses, as we follow Putin's atrocious war, the power of the passion of the good nationalism of the Ukrainian people, based on love for their homeland. Surely it won't be the patriotic parties that risk sinking because of this war but the progressive ones and their supranationalist projects. Let's face it: how many people would die for the European Union and its insipid flag?"

26197	5	"There is no doubt that firmness, to Giorgia Meloni, is suggested by that Guido Crosetto who knows him very well in the Ukrainian dossier, and watches his evolution closely: he who, as president of Aiad, the Confindustria branch that concerns defense and aerospace, plays a not exactly hidden role in the negotiations involving the Italian government in recent days to define the new supply of machinery and vehicles in support of Kyiv. Or maybe there is, more simply, what Ignazio La Russa defines as ""historical coherence"", and defines it humming: ""The world has stood by and watched, sitting on the edge of the grave""."

26197	9	"The boys of Buda, Western indifference in the face of Soviet tanks in Hungary. The fact is that at Palazzo Chigi the reversal of roles is now considered a done deal. Since Meloni, now more than two months ago, assured Mario Draghi ""full availability"" regarding Italy's commitment on the war front, the talks between the leader of the Brothers of Italy and the Prime Minister they remained constant, and almost always cordial. To the point that if an unknown factor remains, in view of the communications to Parliament for the next European Council at the end of June, it concerns, if anything, Giuseppe Conte. “What does he have in mind?”, Try to understand Draghi, asking the not many grillini he trusts, and from which he receives vague answers: “And who knows?”. Yesterday, to say, among the advisers of the former prime minister it was all about fomenting the rumors about the centrist maneuvers aimed at Draghi bis, and which would also involve Luigi Di Maio: ""Write it down: that's what everyone is aiming for, except us""."
26198	1	Washington refuses to listen to Russia and China
26198	3	Jan 19, 2022 Washington refuses to listen to Russia and China
26198	5	Moscow has been waiting all week for a response to its proposed peace-guarantee treaty. Washington never mentioned it. Instead, he accused Russia of preparing to attack Ukraine and planning a false flag operation to justify it. Russia can no longer withdraw, but any action by her risks opening a third world war.
26198	7	The Western press does not follow the relations between the big three (China, the United States and Russia) because it segments them. Consider each problem separately and ignore the links between them. Above all, it ignores the difference between Anglo-Saxon law and that of the United Nations, which leads it to numerous errors of interpretation.
26198	9	The United States and Russia have met three times this week to discuss peace guarantees:
26198	11	in Geneva at the level of Deputy Foreign Ministers;
26198	13	in Brussels in the NATO-Russia Commission;
26198	15	and finally in Vienna, at the OSCE.
26198	17	The US reiterated its warning against stationing 100,000 Russian troops on the Russian-Ukrainian border as Russia was outraged at the US refusal to discuss its peace proposal.
26198	19	At the same time, the US Congress has debated sanctions against Russia, while the State Department has extended its position on Russia to include China, and the Defense Department is considering increasing its nuclear arsenal.
26198	21	In the background, Washington conducted an operation to destabilize Kazakhstan and the European Union established a total economic blockade of Transnistria.
26198	23	If the United States further refuses to heed the reproaches leveled at it and respond to Russian arguments, Moscow now threatens to deploy troops to the Caribbean Basin.
26198	25	The only positive step concerns a possible relaunch of US-Russia negotiations on the control of intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a treaty contested by President Donald Trump.
26198	27	The content of the negotiations
26198	29	When the US delegation arrived in Geneva, it first had a friendly dinner with its Russian counterparts, then informed them the following morning, as the talks began, that its mandate was limited to discussing the deployment of US and Russian troops in Ukraine.
26198	31	"""Other priorities are more important to us: not NATO enlargement, elimination of the infrastructures created, rejection of some measures, and not on a reciprocal basis, but unilaterally by the West"", Sergey Riabkov had already declared when he arrived in Geneva. 1 ."
26198	33	The Russians then replied that the mandate of the US delegation only incidentally corresponded to the official object of the meeting: to guarantee world peace. So Wendy Sherman and Sergey Riabkov looked at the topics they might discuss next and came up with only one: a new Intermediate Nuclear Missile Reduction Treaty; the INF Treaty was denounced by President Donald Trump.
26198	35	The next day Wendy Sherman attended the NATO-Russia Commission meeting in Brussels. Allied ambassadors had a hard time assessing Washington's intentions after its abandonment of Afghanistan to the Taliban and its betrayal of France with the AUKUS deal. Ms. Sherman therefore had them speak first, then essentially declared to the Russian delegation: “Of course, there are thirty of us here in front of you, but we are only one on our positions ”. She then paints the landscape of what Europe would have become if Washington had caved in to Moscow: once again a continent divided into two zones of influence, one Atlanticist, the other Russian, as during the Cold War.
26198	37	This presentation stirred terrible memories so that allied ambassadors would hear nothing else. The denials of the Russian delegation, pointing out that it was not Soviet and did not want to share the continent, were just background noise. Maybe the Russians again put forward their demands for respect for the UN Charter and for their word, no one remembers.
26198	39	The American press commented on this meeting, saying that it had given NATO, denounced by Presidents Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron, a new reason for existing: to fight Russia.
26198	41	Under these conditions, the third meeting, that of the OSCE in Vienna, was only – in the words of Sergey Lavrov – “dilator”. The OSCE has no decision-making power, it is just a forum created during the Cold War to evaluate positions. The Swedish presidency of its Permanent Council was in the image of this country, officially neutral, but internally discussing its imminent accession to NATO. The allies were on the defensive, while the United States itself tried to play for time. The meeting did not even lead to a final statement.
26198	43	Moscow expected Washington to flatly reject its proposals, but was amazed at how US diplomats managed to manipulate NATO and OSCE members. This is the second time that Vladimir Putin has come up against the irrational behavior of Europeans in the Union. Remember, in 2007, he thought he could alienate Western Europeans from their American overlord by going to the Munich Security Conference and asking them to ask the question about their interests? -2.
26198	45	He had mistakenly believed it would capture their attention, particularly that of the Germans. The same phenomenon is repeated today.
26198	47	It is clear that most European leaders, with the notable exception of the Russians, do not want to be independent. He renounces his responsibilities and prefers to bow to an illegitimate and cruel world order.
26198	49	Hysteria in Washington
26198	51	In Washington, the White House is aware that it no longer has the means for its global policy, but not the ruling class. Congress was the scene of grandiloquent positions denouncing Russian impudence and in particular that of its president, Vladimir Putin. MPs have gone so far as to discuss sanctioning it in his name, which would result in the rupture of diplomatic relations with his country.
26198	53	No one seems to be aware that the United States is no longer the world's leading military power and that Russia and China have replaced them.
26198	55	"Less silly than the sanctions against President Putin, Congress has mostly anguished over the possible re-instatement of sanctions against Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Republican Senator Marco Rubio defended the idea that Germans who make a deal with ""the devil"", including the Social Democrat ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who led the construction of the pipeline, should be punished so that they no longer have choice-3 . On the contrary, the Democrats, on the advice of the White House, argued that it would be wiser to convince the Germans to choose the right field themselves than to force them to do so. The Ukrainian government backed up this common-sense approach by recalling that the Germans had negotiated guarantees with Russia not to use its gas supplies as a weapon.-4."
26198	57	This grotesque debate was possible only because everyone has forgotten the reason that led President Joe Biden to lift the sanctions against Nord Stream 2 shortly before the Russian-American summit in Geneva.-5 : it was a way to get the Europeans to pass war damage account in Syria. They would pay for cheap Russian gas, but a little less than expected. No one even remembers that the United States lost that war.
26198	59	Everything continues as if nothing had happened
26198	61	Far from giving in to the merits, the State Department has extended its Russian narrative to China, which supports Russia. Not only would Russia want to invade Ukraine and extend its rule over all of Central and Eastern Europe, but China would like to conquer the entire China Sea.
26198	63	If the dispute with Russia is post-dissolution of the Soviet Union, the one with China dates back much further, to the tragic colonial period.
26198	65	The State Department is relying on the 2016 Hague Court of Arbitration ruling, which convicted China in the territorial dispute with the Philippines, to dismiss Beijing-6's arguments. However, an arbitral tribunal is not a court, and China does not recognize this tribunal, which has not arbitrated at all, but has only ratified the Philippine version of the dispute. Far from helping to establish anything, this episode bears witness to the way the United States interprets international law in general and the United Nations Charter in particular.
26198	67	China rightly lays claim to the islands it ruled in the 18th century and abandoned when it collapsed under the beatings of colonization. Most remained uninhabited until about 30 years ago, i.e. until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The United States, by claiming to attribute them to its allies in this area, displays the same conquering imperialism that has placed Central and Eastern Europe under the command of NATO.
26198	69	Moreover, during this week, Washington continued its operations to destabilize Kazakhstan and support the calls for the overthrow of the regime launched by Mukhtar Ablyazov from Paris. Finally, he encouraged the European Union to organize a blockade of Transnistria, this unrecognized state wedged between Ukraine and Moldova-7. If he seems to have lost in Kazakhstan, he is already preparing the next episode in Transnistria.
26198	71	The United States masquerades in its denial and sends emissaries to each of its vassals to warn them of an impending Russian attack on Ukraine following a false flag provocation,
26198	73	Provisional conclusion
26198	75	This week has shown, as one might expect, that the United States does not intend to abide by either the United Nations Charter or its own word. They won't back down anywhere on their own. Their proposals aim at best to preserve the status quo.
26198	77	"Their strategy appears to be based on the idea that the Russians and the Chinese will not dare to confront each other. This is the ""madman theory"" once used by President Richard Nixon against the Soviet Union: yes, I'm wrong and I may not be the strongest, but I'm mad and my reactions are irrational and unpredictable. I'm not interested in winning, I can break everything. This attitude is like a bet. It didn't let the United States win the Vietnam War."
26198	79	Russia obviously anticipated the next blow when it released its draft Peace Guarantee Treaty. But she will have to adapt it because Washington has managed to round up all of her frightened vassals. If there is a confrontation, it will be nuclear and will certainly cause hundreds of millions of casualties.
26198	81	If Washington is planning the next skirmish in Transnistria, Moscow is ready to play the next move, probably in the Caribbean basin, on the model of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis to the American ruling class which no longer has the superiority it used and abused much.
262	1	"Moscow's missiles on Odessa: Michel forced to take refuge. Zelensky: ""Putin like Hitler"""
262	3	"May 9 of Ukraine is a day of remembrance and anger. In which the victory in the Second World War expropriated by the Russian aggressor is celebrated. A good opportunity for President Volodymyr Zelensky to pour a sort of historical curse on the enemy. The acting president speaks of Putin as «the one who is repeating today the horrible crimes of Hitler's regime, following the philosophy of the Nazis and repeating everything they did. He is doomed. Because he was cursed by millions of ancestors when he began to imitate their killer. And then he will lose everything.' After all, ""only a madman can hope to repeat 2194 days of war"", says Zelensky referring to the endless duration of the Second World War at a time when even the war in Ukraine seems destined to last far beyond expectations."
262	4	"The man from Kiev is convinced that history will have no mercy on Putin: «Very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And some will have none», he says mockingly. And after all Zelensky yesterday strengthened relations with Europe, part of ""a free world and a united Europe"". That Europe to which he has taken another step closer, having completed the second part of the questionnaire to obtain the status of EU candidate. According to the UNIAN agency, which reports the news, Zelensky yesterday had a virtual meeting with the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen via video link, whom he thanked ""for the clear signs of support for Ukraine"" in this important path ."
262	5	"That wasn't the only summit Zelensky attended yesterday. Which received the Canadian premiere Justin Trudeau, with whom he awarded the dog Patron (the now legendary Jack Russell who has tracked down hundreds of explosive devices since the invasion of Russia began) and with whom he spoke of greater collaboration between the two countries for the demining of Ukraine. And then Zelensky also saw on video the President of the EU Council Charles Michel, who made a surprise visit to Odessa on the occasion of Europe Day. An ""excursion"" which also had an unscheduled event full of anxieties. Michel was in fact forced to take shelter in an air-raid shelter following an alarm for a Russian missile raid. The sudden escape interrupted his meeting with the Ukrainian premier Denys Shmygal, with whom Zelensky was also connected. «I am in the city where, as Pushkin said, Europe can be felt», Michel wrote in a tweet, speaking of his mission as «a further demonstration of the EU's unshakeable solidarity with the Ukrainian people in their battle against the Russian invasion""."
262	7	"In the big city on the Black Sea, Michel stopped at the port, where he was able to ascertain the consequences of the Russian blockade on the transit of goods in the Black Sea, first of all wheat. Then, accompanied by the commander of the Ukrainian navy, he was able to see firsthand the damage to residential buildings caused by the attacks of Putin's Russian army and was updated on Russian attacks from the Black Sea, before being personally involved in one of them . After the obligatory pause for the bombing of Odessa, Michel and Shmygal continued their meeting in a refuge, speaking of humanitarian, military and financial aid for Kiev, and of the ""importance of providing liquidity to the Kiev government""."
2620	1	ECR, Lease: EU-NATO cooperate more and more to guarantee the choice of countries to join the alliance
2620	3	"In days of war like these we are living. With the alarm that the conflict could extend its range and further harden its threat. And with Finland and Sweden having raised the alarm with their request to join NATO, the Russian invasion of Ukraine - considered by the Kremlin ""a special military operation necessary"" to defend themselves from the Atlantic alliance - continues to push the countries neutral towards the US-led military alliance. A decision adopted and made official, despite the harsh retaliation announced by Moscow. Accompanied by real military warnings"
2620	5	"On this point, then, Raffaele Fitto (co-president of the Ecr-FdI group), speaking during the Conference of Presidents in the exchange of views with the Secretary General of NATO Stoltemberg, underlined how «transatlantic relations and EU-NATO cooperation, in full respect of the principles established in the treaties and those agreed by the European Council, are essential elements to successfully face the geopolitical and common security challenges of the coming years"". «NATO – continued Fitto in his analysis – represents the true guarantor of Euro-Atlantic security. And with this in mind, we must take all the necessary actions to strengthen our defense capabilities. But also to face future challenges, not only from a military point of view, but also hybrid ones such as cybersecurity. Strengthening intelligence capabilities. And the fight against terrorism""."
26200	3	In general, it is good to avoid attributing nefarious intent to actions that can be justified by simple stupidity. But this is one case where sheer stupidity cannot explain the long and steady procession of foreign policy blunders spanning three decades, all specifically aimed at strengthening Russia. It is not possible to think that an excess of arrogance, ignorance, greed and political opportunism and the lack [in the United States] of competent foreign policy analysts could have produced such a result, because, in practice, it would be like arguing that some monkeys with drills, milling cutters and lathes are capable of manufacturing a Swiss watch. The only alternative, however, would be to argue that there is a network of Kremlin agents hidden in the bowels of the US deep state and that all these agents have worked in concert to advance Russia's interests, while constantly maintaining plausible deniability at all levels of operation.
26200	5	On the surface, the plan was to weaken and destroy Russia; after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia had weakened and was destroying itself perfectly well, without the need for outside intervention. Incredibly, though, every US effort to weaken and destroy Russia has made it stronger; if even a rudimentary feedback mechanism had existed, this huge discrepancy between policy objectives and outcomes would have been detected and the necessary adjustments made. Superficially, this lack could be explained by the very nature of America's farcical democracy, where each administration can blame its failures on the mistakes of the previous administration, but the Deep State never stops governing, and after a few cycles of these fiascos repeated, he would simply be forced to admit to himself that there was a problem with the plan to weaken and destroy Russia. The fact that it has not detected any such problems brings us full circle, to the suspicion that there are agents of Putin working tirelessly in the bowels of the American deep state.
26200	7	But this is pure conspiracy theory and we shouldn't even come close to such a thing. Suffice it to say that, at the moment, there is no adequate explanation for what happened. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it would have taken very little to hasten the collapse of Russia. But none of these steps had been taken, and those that had been taken (with the ostensible goal of weakening and destroying Russia) had resulted in the exact opposite. Because? Below are 10 of the most successful initiatives of what appears to be a US deep state MRGA (Make Russia Great Again) campaign. If you have an alternative explanation, I'd like to hear about it.
26200	9	1. Had Russia been immediately accepted into the World Trade Organization (which it wanted to join) it would have been inundated with cheap imports, which would have completely destroyed Russian industry and agriculture. Russia would simply sell its oil, gas, timber, diamonds and other resources and buy whatever it needed. Instead, the United States and other WTO members had spent 18 years negotiating Russia's entry into the organization. When Russia joined in 2006, there was little time left before the 2008 financial crash, after which the WTO no longer played a major role.
26200	11	2. Had Russia been immediately granted visa-free travel to the West (as it wanted), the majority of working-age Russians would have quickly dispersed out of Russia, leaving behind a population of orphans and the elderly, just as happened to contemporary Ukraine. Having lost much of its productive population, Russia would not pose any kind of economic or military threat. Instead, Russia had never been granted visa-free travel and had faced restrictions that, over time, had only increased. By now most Russians have internalized the idea that they are not wanted in the West and that they have to seek their fortune at home.
26200	13	3. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia itself had collapsed into a patchwork of regional centers. Many of them (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, the Ural Republic, Chechnya) had thought about secession. Had it not been touched, Russia would have turned into a loose confederation, without the possibility of a common foreign policy. Instead, resources and mercenaries had been poured into Chechnya, turning it into an existential threat to Moscow's authority and forcing it to become militarily assertive. The fact that Chechen volunteers are now fighting in Ukraine on Russia's side underscores the failure of America's Chechen policy.
26200	15	4. If, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO had simply recognized that the threat it intended to counter no longer existed and melted away or simply went dormant, Russia would never have found it necessary to rearm. In fact, Russia was happy to tear up its ships and missiles for scrap metal. Instead, NATO had seen fit to bomb Yugoslavia (for a made-up humanitarian motive) and then expand inexorably eastward. These actions had most adequately conveyed the message that the West was not opposed to the USSR and communism, but to Russia itself. And while not many Russians were willing to fight and die for the glory of Communism in the 1990s, defending the Motherland is a different story altogether.
26200	17	5. Had Russia been left alone, it would never have thought of venturing outside its vast and underpopulated territory. But then came the provocation: Georgian troops, with US authorization, attacked Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, forcing Russia to fight back. The fact that Russia had managed to demilitarize Georgia in a matter of days had been a major confidence booster and taught her that NATO and NATO-trained forces are soft and squishy and pose no problem. The Russian territory had thus expanded to include South Ossetia, with Abkhazia as an added bonus, paving the way for further territorial expansion (Crimea, Donbass, Kherson… Nikolaev, Odessa…).
26200	19	6. Had the United States left Syria alone, a staunch ally of Russia for nearly a century, Russia would not have expanded into the Mediterranean region. Instead, the Syrian government had called on Russia to help turn the tide of the US-backed war against ISIS, and Russia had destroyed ISIS with the help of a rather small contingent of air and space forces, located at a single air base. The action in Syria showcased Russia's modern weapon systems and generated orders from around the world for the next 20 years. Moreover, Russia's global allies know that if the United States and NATO, or their mercenaries, give them trouble, just whistle and Moscow will rush in with its precision bombs and neatly stack the corpses.
26200	21	"7. After the 2014 Kiev putsch and the reinstatement of Crimea, US/Western sanctions had proved immensely helpful in launching a large-scale program of import substitution, rejuvenating both Russian industry and agriculture. Today, Russia is largely self-sufficient in food and is a major exporter of agricultural products. Its position as the world's leading breadbasket will be further strengthened by the addition of the ""black earth"" regions of eastern and southern Ukraine, which are characterized by extraordinarily fertile soils. The sanctions had been accompanied by speculative attacks on the ruble that had dropped its value from 30 to a dollar to 60 (where it is today) making Russian products much more internationally competitive and stimulating foreign trade."
26200	23	8. The endless threats to exclude Russia from using the SWIFT interbank messaging system prompted Russia to create its own payment system, now integrated with the Chinese one. The seizure of Russia's $300 billion sovereign wealth fund that was deposited in Western banks, coupled with the freezing of Russian oligarchs' funds, have taught Russians not to trust Western banks and to avoid keeping their money abroad. All these hostile actions in the financial sphere paved the way for a rather measured response, which instantly made the ruble the most valuable and stable currency on the planet, leaving the dollar and euro vulnerable to hyperinflation.
26200	25	9. The eight-year war waged by the Ukrainian army, with the unquestioned support of the United States and NATO, against the Russian civilian population in the Donbass, has produced a very clear idea in the Russian population: the West wants to exterminate them. When the Ukrainians declared their intention to build nuclear bombs, when it was discovered that the Pentagon's biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine were working on creating pathogens specifically aimed at the Russians and, finally, when it became clear that there were not only the Ukrainians but also NATO behind all this and that the Ukrainians plus NATO were ready to launch an all out attack, Russia anticipated this by launching its own Special Operation. As cynical as it sounds, the previous eight-year bombings of buildings full of old people, women and children, shown live on Russian TV news but consistently ignored in the West, were instrumental in producing an approval rating for Operation Special that has reached 76%, with a similar approval rating for Putin, his government and even many of the regional governors. Now that, despite Western arms shipments, the Ukrainian military is being shredded at a rate that will bring it to an end in about 20 days (the predicted “Day Z”), Russia is poised to emerge as the absolute winner of WW3 which, just like the Cold War, which it had lost, was barely fought. This will restore the mystique of the perpetually victorious Russian army.
26200	27	10. Finally, Russia should be grateful for the massive funding that the United States and the collective West have provided over the years in support of freedom of speech and of the press in Russia, by which we mean pro-Western propaganda. First, they helped free up the Russian media space, to the point where Russia is now far more open to freedom of expression than any European country or the United States, with barely a hint of corporate censorship or a culture of erasure rampant. in the West. Second, the onslaught of Western propaganda has been so pounding and overbearing that Russians, after processing it for a few years, are now laughing openly at the pro-Western narrative, and opinion-research agencies report that Russian support for pro-Western policies -Westerners is present only in minimal quantities. The process was aided by the sheer ludicrousness of various Western policies: cancel culture, MeToo, LGBT, gender reassignment in children, promotion of paedophilia and everything in between, which produced a wave of revulsion. This 180º reversal from the predominantly pro-Western views of the early 1990s to the current situation is the crowning achievement of the entire three-decade long campaign of the US deep state to make Russia great again (MRGA).
26200	29	"I am not arguing that the existence of MRGA within the US Deep State is probable and provable. But I invite you to follow Arthur Conan Doyle's famous saying: ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"" and let me know what you think."
26201	1	Putin's strategy and the Surikov report
26201	3	Riad main recipient of funds for the Chinese Silk Road in the first half of 2022
26201	5	Despite the relentless pro-Atlantic propaganda trying to represent a very different situation, Russia's advance in the Donbass continues unabated. Soon the predominantly Russian-speaking territory of eastern Ukraine will be liberated entirely, and thus the Moscow special operation will enter another phase.
26201	7	For this reason, many speculations emerge about Russia's real intentions after having liberated Donbass, battered in the last 8 years by the Kiev regime which has shown its most ferocious face in this territory.
26201	9	Where will Russia go? Does it really intend to continue its advance as instrumentally affirmed by the pro-NATO media, interested in fueling this conflict and continuing to stuff the Kiev regime with all kinds of armaments?
26201	11	Putin's strategy and the Surikov report
26201	13	"The strategy followed by Putin seems to follow the one outlined by a group of scholars at the Independent Defense Research Institute in Moscow in the mid-1990s, when Russia was trying to recover after the tragic and ruinous implosion of the Soviet Union. An event described by Putin as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century"". The goal could therefore be the creation of a new federation of states comprising Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, part of Ukraine (Novorossiya), the Republic of Pridnestrovia (Transnistria), Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the same time , Russia's relations with Transcaucasia and Central Asia in the same way as the relations once existing within the Comecon framework."
26201	15	This strategic goal for Moscow, which Western analysts painstakingly describe as Soviet revanchism, neo-imperialism, neo-tsarism, nationalism and so on, is nothing more than a vital need for Putin's Russia. In Moscow they feel their very existence threatened by what we can define, still today as in the times of the Soviet Union, the main enemy: the United States.
26201	17	Thinking about what happened in the past, about Russia's struggle for its survival, he reveals that in reality Moscow has not started a war, but as announced by President Putin himself in his address to the nation held on the night of February 24, that of Russia is a special military operation aimed at demilitarizing and denazifying the regime in Kiev, and protecting the Donbass. It might seem like a secondary issue or only a semantic one, but it is not because it is the basis on which the pro-NATO warmongering propaganda is based, which is raging in Western countries and occupies all the media space without admitting dissident voices. The causes and responsibilities of the tragic turning point in Ukraine are to be found in the policies of the United States and NATO. Armed arm and instrument through which the United States controls Europe.
26201	19	When the Soviet Union imploded, the Western bloc assured Russian leaders that NATO would not advance an inch. Instead, the Atlantic bloc has gone as far as the borders with Russia, which is so backward as to find itself with its back to the wall. Furthermore, the United States has turned Ukraine into an anti-Russian outpost, a military and even biological threat to Russia on its doorstep. While Kiev implemented a genocidal policy towards the populations of Donbass started after the 2014 fascist coup, trying to deliberately annihilate all that is Russian. The dreaded accession of Ukraine to NATO constituted the definitive crossing of the red line drawn by the Kremlin. Russia's first reaction move was the 'reacquisition' of Crimea which it was rightly feared would be transformed into a sort of NATO naval base. This was the beginning of the Russian determination to create a buffer between NATO and Russia with a neutral and demilitarized Ukraine.
26201	21	"In the aforementioned Surikov Report, which appeared in the Segodnja newspaper in 1995 and published in Italian by the Limes magazine the following year, the experts of the Inobis institute write: «THE MAIN EXTERNAL FORCE potentially capable of threatening the national security of the Russian Federation, the economic and political interests of Russia in the world, and to influence the political and economic situation in Russia and its relations with the former republics of the USSR, are the United States of America, which, as a rule, pursue their policy by interacting with other western countries, with Israel and with Japan. The main objective of these countries vis-à-vis Russia is to prevent the Russian Federation from becoming an influential force economically, politically and militarily, and to turn it into a colony subject to the West, which wants access to its raw material. It is therefore the United States and its allies who constitute the main sources of threats to the country's national security. They must therefore be regarded as potential enemies of the Russian Federation."""
26201	23	The picture outlined seems to be the current one, proving that the US strategy towards Russia is long-lasting and undoubtedly aims at the disintegration of the Russian Federation which arose from the implosion of the Soviet Union.
26201	25	"The document could not fail to touch on the theme of NATO's enlargement to the east given that we are in the years where the West does not respect what it promised to the Moscow leaders. Also in this case, the experts seem to photograph the current situation: «Western policy regarding the future of NATO will probably consist in isolating Russia and expelling her from Europe. Germany is at the forefront of promoting NATO's eastward expansion. Indeed, we are witnessing Germany attempting to resume its eastward and southeastward expansion, already stalled twice in the course of the century. Today this aim is pursued essentially by political and economic means, under the protection of the American ""atomic shield"". The United States is also promoting NATO's eastward expansion""."
26201	27	"When Russian strategists then outline a strategy to neutralize external threats and to ensure the national survival of the Russian Federation, they believe that ""a change of course in the economy is the main factor for the salvation of Russia""."
26201	29	A change that occurred with the inauguration of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, the man who practically raised Russia from the abyss in which it ended up during the Yeltsin era. And in fact today's Russia is showing an unexpected capacity for resilience and resistance for the West itself, which intended to bend Moscow with sanctions and embargoes. Just the excessive use of sanctions, especially their use against Russia since 2014, has made this ama blunt and has led to a self-sufficient Russian economy that is 80% self-sufficient in consumer goods and impressive progress technologies in the oil and gas sectors. Moreover, Moscow has also benefited greatly from Chinese cooperation which has allowed it to offset the impact of the sanctions.
26201	31	Russia and China have already started questioning the dollar's role as a reserve currency and are looking for alternatives. Much of Chinese and Russian trade is now conducted bilaterally. ASEAN, for example, has begun to trade more and more in its own national currencies.
26201	33	"Finally, the Surikov report indicates that “the purpose of the West is to worsen Russia's relations not only with Ukraine but also with countries such as China and Iran. Moreover, the West intends to exert powerful and constant pressure on the entire territory of the former Soviet Union, and especially on the border areas between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Russia should therefore opt for a firm approach regarding NATO expansion, the Baltic republics, the conflict in Chechnya, the oil resources in the Caspian Sea and the situation along the Tajik-Afghan border, and at the same time be very careful to react to any provocation by nationalistic forces in China and eastern and southern Ukraine""."
26201	35	The situation on the ground and the prospects for Russia
26201	37	Ukraine has no chance of winning the war against the world's second military power, yet the mainstream media continue to chatter about the phantom counterattacks of the Kiev regime, also fueled by irresponsible statements by warmongering politicians such as Mario Draghi, who hypocritically speak of peace and negotiations as they work hard to fuel and consequently widen the conflict with Russia. Meanwhile, the forces of Moscow and the allies continue inexorably to advance, pace of Western propaganda punctually denied by the facts.
26201	39	"On July 3, the Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu (given dead several times by Western fake media), informed President Putin of the complete liberation of the territory of the People's Republic of Lugansk. Shoigu reported that ""as a result of successful military actions, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation together with units of the People's Militia of the Lugansk People's Republic have established full control over the city of Lisichansk"" and nearby towns."
26201	41	Probably now, with the complete liberation of the territory of the People's Republic of Lugansk, Russia will be able to concentrate its forces in the areas of Donetsk and Gorlovka where the troops of the Kiev regime have managed to maintain their positions.
26201	43	"If in the Donbass Russia has obtained an undoubted victory from every point of view, the situation regarding the Isle of Snakes, where Russia has withdrawn, is different. According to Russian military officials, the decision was a ""goodwill step"" aimed at demonstrating to the world community that Moscow does not hinder the efforts of the United Nations to organize a humanitarian corridor for the export of grain from the territory of Ukraine."
26201	45	The Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said the Russian withdrawal would not allow Kiev to speculate on the impending food crisis, blaming Russia for the inability to export grain.
26201	47	However, Moscow has glossed over the continuous attacks by Ukrainian forces strengthened by new Western war deliveries. On 27 June - reports Southfront.org - the first news of the destruction of a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system deployed on the island was released. Later, satellite images confirmed that at least one of the Russian Pantsir-S1 systems was damaged.
26201	49	In total, according to various reports, 2 or 3 Pantsir-SM systems and 2 or 3 Tor-M2U systems were destroyed. Satellite images revealed that the other systems were not destroyed, but were forced to constantly change their position on the island.
26201	51	Later, on June 29 and 27, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that Ukrainian missiles had been intercepted over the island. Therefore, there were still operating air defense systems at Russian military positions on the island.
26201	53	Ukrainian attacks on Russian positions did not stop.
26201	55	On June 30, Ukrainian media said Russian forces had abandoned their positions and allegedly burned military equipment left behind on the island.
26201	57	Photos and satellite images confirm that fire has broken out in different areas of the island, probably as a result of shelling. The damaged pier can be seen. The Ukrainian military has released a video showing the attack on the island that took place on June 21. The Kiev military show that the shelling was carried out by the Ukrainian self-propelled howitzer 2C22 'Bogdana'. However, Kiev's forces now have a huge choice of foreign equipment to target Russian positions on the island, such as the infamous Himars rocket launchers.
26201	59	Attacks that Ukrainian forces conducted in close cooperation with US military intelligence. US reconnaissance aircraft are always spotted in the Black Sea before bombing. So it happened this time too. A US RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance drone took off from Italy's Sigonella Air Base and flew a reconnaissance mission over the Black Sea in the early hours of 30 June.
26201	61	However, the strategic impact of the Russian withdrawal was less significant than the political one, because the Ukrainians do not yet have the possibility to take control of the island and deploy any military equipment there, as the Russian Black Sea Fleet is still patrolling in sea.
26201	63	According to some analysts, control of the Isle of Serpents is no longer as important as it was at the beginning of the Russian military operation. As Andrew Korybko points out: «Control of this small territory at the beginning of the conflict was meant to prevent NATO from resupplying Kiev's forces by sea and perhaps even directly threatening Crimea, which democratically reunited with its historic Russian homeland in the spring of 2014.
26201	65	"It was never really intended to facilitate an Odessa amphibious landing, despite speculation to the contrary from friendly and non-friendly sources. Its military-strategic significance in this sense is no longer so relevant after Turkey officially halted NATO exercises in the Black Sea as an unofficial gesture of goodwill towards Russia to gain its trust as a mediator with Kiev for the opening of a ""grain corridor"", the outcome of which would have completely discredited the US narrative that Moscow provoked the crisis."
26201	67	The proposed plan calls for Turkey to de-mine the port of Odessa and then escort Ukrainian ships carrying grain in international waters, after which the Russian Navy would escort them up to the Bosphorus. With the progress made on this front and with Russia's national security interests which, as explained above, are safeguarded by the pragmatic balancing act between Turkey and NATO, the military-strategic significance of Snake Island is no longer so relevant.
26201	69	"On the contrary, maintaining control over this small territory is counterproductive in terms of soft power, as it has been exploited by Kiev and the mass media to spread fear of an alleged amphibious assault on Odessa, which in reality was not been planned, and to point to false ""evidence"" that Russia is ""blockading"" that port. Both infowar narratives will now be discredited after this withdrawal, which in turn will further reduce Western public confidence in their own governments."
26201	71	Thus, the forces of Moscow and the allies are advancing, slowly but surely. With the probable objective of achieving the complete liberation of the so-called Novorossiya, in order to exclude the Kiev regime from access to the Black Sea and reunite with the Republic of Pridnestrovia (Transnistria). Just as the aforementioned Surikov report outlined.
26201	73	The story is on its way
26201	75	As we can see, the Western strategy has entered a phase of full implementation. With USA/NATO pulling the strings, and a masochistically European Union in the forefront of the assault on Russia. However, we can put a tombstone on the theory of the so-called 'End of History' that the North American political scientist Fukuyama proposed for the fall of the Soviet Union and which would definitely take place with the defeat of Russia.
26201	77	History has restarted, the change is already underway, it is happening before our eyes. This is why war propaganda is so strong, and even the faintest dissent is silenced and criminalized in what, against all evidence, still insists on calling itself the free world.
26201	79	The unipolar order dominated by the United States has now reached the end credits objectively. At the end of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine, humanity could finally enter a new era characterized by multipolarity and the rise of Eurasian powers. An international architecture which, compared to the past, provides for a plurality of balanced relationships and powers.
26202	1	99% did not want the Green Pass to be extended, and in fact they did. Democracy in Europe
26202	3	As you know, given that we have dedicated several articles to the subject, on a proposal from the European Commission, the European Parliament voted yesterday, as planned, to renew the EU Digital Covid certificate for another year. The vote was 453 in favour, 119 against and 19 abstentions.
26202	5	"The certificate regulation was scheduled to expire on 30 June. Earlier this month, a delegation from Parliament had already reached a ""political agreement"" with the Commission on the renewal of the certificate, thus making yesterday's vote practically a foregone conclusion. The funny thing, and which shows how much the EU cares about people's opinions, is that the Commission had held a public consultation whose results were extremely negative. The consultation gathered over 385,000 responses, almost all against the renewal!"
26202	7	In a letter to the European Ombudsman that French MEP Virginie Joron posted on her Twitter profile, Joron writes:
26202	9	Comme la @EU_Commission ne tient pas compte des avis des européens (https://t.co/toA1bLqX8c) ; je saisis la Médiatrice européenne. pic.twitter.com/OiWEfJ6GlP
26202	11	— Virginie Joron (@v_joron) June 14, 2022
26202	13	I read hundreds of random responses with my team. I have not found any in favor of extending the QR code [i.e. the digital certificate]. Based on this large survey, it seems obvious that virtually all responses were negative.
26202	15	The negative trend of responses was evident from the outset. The full first page of responses, all dating back to February 4, can be found here. They are, of course, in the different languages ​​of the European Union: French, German, Italian and even one in English.
26202	17	To give readers an idea of ​​the tenor, here is a translation of a line or two of the first responses (starting at the bottom of the page):
26202	19	I am completely against the creation of this certificate given what is currently happening with the disastrous handling of Covid by the EU…
26202	21	I want this cst [probably a reference to Belgium's 'Covid Safe Ticket'] or vaccination passport simply deleted…
26202	23	There are scientifically unsupported claims in the draft document. For example, the Covid certificate is claimed to be effective protection against the spread of the virus – what data can support this claim?…
26202	25	Hi, I am shocked and disgusted by the freedom killing decisions taken in the EU…regarding this “European certificate”…..
26202	27	I never want to be subjected to a discriminatory certificate again…
26202	29	And so on through 385,191 replies, almost all negative.
26202	31	Naturally, since the responses were almost all negative and against, the Commission decided the opposite: it reached an agreement to continue it. Because, in the end, the Commission doesn't care what Europeans think. The important thing is only his agenda.

26203	1	The 16 Biggest Lies the US Government Tells the World About the War in Ukraine
26203	3	Lies lies lies, here is the motto of the new normality, a hymn to lies that grips the masses now in the grip of uncontrolled automatisms that defend with drawn sword….
26203	5	…I was referring to the masses that are not you who are reading, I know there are few of you, but you have the privilege of fighting for a noble cause which is very rare these days.
26203	7	Toba60
26203	9	In any war, the first casualty is the truth. Here are the biggest lies
26203	11	(1) “Ukraine is a democracy
26203	13	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has banned all opposition parties and banned the use of Russian as a second state language.
26203	15	Why did he violate his 2019 campaign promise to stop the genocidal killing of thousands of people in Donbas, even though they voted for him? Did he lie because the neo-Nazis threatened to kill him if he didn't do what they wanted? [Or is he afraid of the CIA, who have assassinated other leaders, making him their puppet? Should we trust the judgment of a man calling for a no-fly zone that could cause a global nuclear holocaust? Zelensky supervises the torture and assassination of political dissidents[2].
26203	17	(2) “National sovereignty is sacred”
26203	19	"When Idi Amin perpetrated genocide in Uganda, the United Nations violated Ugandan sovereignty to stop him. When Ukraine perpetrated a genocide in the Donbas and planned an escalation, Russia stopped it. [The United States violated Cuba's sovereignty to bring the planet to the brink of nuclear holocaust. The United States has violated many sovereignties in recent wars, killing millions of people. Given the genocide of a national minority by Ukraine, ""the sovereignty of Ukraine should be respected""."
26203	21	(3) “Putin is a war criminal
26203	23	"If it is a war criminal for causing civilian deaths, what do we call the Ukraine that has killed 14,000 civilians in the Donbas since 2014? [4] Does anyone call Zelensky a war criminal? Millions of people killed by the US in other recent wars are hundreds of times worse. Calling Putin a war criminal prevents Biden from negotiating with him under the “you can't talk to war criminals” excuse. This makes it very difficult to stop this war. Evidently, the US wants this war to continue down to the last Ukrainian. The Rand Corporation's plan is to ""pump"" Russia into the quagmire just as the US bankrupted the USSR by starting Al-Qaeda opposition in Afghanistan."
26203	25	(4) “The world condemns the invasion of Russia”.
26203	27	In fact, most of the world doesn't, including China, India, much of Africa, Israel, half of Latin America, and many other countries. Russia's two largest political parties do not oppose Russia's intervention, the second being the Communist Party.
26203	29	"(5) ""Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons."""
26203	31	Russia has the same policy as the United States. On March 22, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its very existence was threatened, Tassnews agency reported. [5] Russia had a “no first use” policy until the US refused to do the same, then abandoned it. US presidents have threatened to use nuclear weapons several times since the end of World War II against countries that pose no threat to the US [6].
26203	33	"(6) ""With his back against the wall, Putin will resort to chemical warfare, just like in Syria""."
26203	35	Russia has not used chemical weapons in Syria. Russia has negotiated the destruction or removal of Syrian stockpiles. The chemical attacks in Syria were carried out by rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States. [7] If anyone is cornered, it is the Ukrainians and neo-Nazis, trained by the CIA in false-flag tactics. As in Syria, the US media falsely blame the Russians without any evidence. As in Syria, any chemicals released in Ukraine will likely be the work of Russia's opponents to blame on the latter.
26203	37	The United States supplied Iraq with chemical weapons that were used to kill thousands of Kurds and Iranians in 1982-83, before stockpiles were destroyed by Iraq. The US is the chemical killer, not Russia which prevented it. History is full of US false flags. [8]
26203	39	(1) “Putin may resort to biological warfare”.
26203	41	Although this accusation was circulated by the media in the second week of March, after the embarrassing revelation that the Pentagon has funded laboratories in Ukraine, the media has not covered it again. At first the US reported that dangerous samples had to be destroyed to prevent them from falling into Russian hands; later, it was reported that the samples were not dangerous at all, so as not to incriminate the United States.
26203	43	Any release of pathogens by Ukraine to blame Russia is now likely precluded. The Pentagon is guilty of funding gain-of-function virus research in China after it was banned in the United States, with the risk of a possible laboratory release of COVID-19. The United States is the bio-killer that used a US military strain of anthrax in October 2001, not Russia.
26203	45	"(7) ""Russia is targeting civilians in Ukraine."""
26203	47	"According to Newsweek, “Putin is not intentionally attacking civilians… Over the course of nearly four weeks, little missiles have been fired at Kiev… Destruction is only a small fraction of what is possible.” [9] The alleged massacre of civilians in Bucha, which prompted Biden to accuse Putin of war crimes, was perpetrated by Ukrainians who were ""clearing"" the city of alleged collaborators after Russian troops left days earlier. [10]"
26203	49	(8) “Russia will do false flag attacks”
26203	51	There is no evidence that Russia attacked targets and blamed Ukraine. In contrast, seven days before the Russian incursion, the OSCE Monitoring Mission provided evidence of a Ukrainian false flag attack on an asylum to blame Donbas separatists. [Nobody was killed, but Ukrainian shelling on Donetsk increased 100-fold over the next four days, leading to Russia's incursion to stop it.
26203	53	[The attacks on a maternity ward, apartments and a concert hall may have been false flag attacks, staged events or situations in which civilians were held hostage by combatants. It was reported that in a maternity ward there were Ukrainian snipers shooting from there. Residents of Mariupol who exited testified that Ukrainian fighters prevented civilians from fleeing through the humanitarian corridor to use them as human shields.[13]
26203	55	(9) “If Putin prevails in Ukraine, he will attack NATO countries”.
26203	57	This claim is blatantly ridiculous, because Russia is already overextended and unable to attack anyone else. Furthermore, Russia does not want a nuclear war. Russia's goal is to secure the Donbas, gain recognition of Crimea, de-Nazify Ukraine and prevent nuclear missiles from approaching the Russian border. By exaggerating Putin's goals instead of negotiating them, the United States is prolonging the war and causing the destruction of Ukraine.
26203	59	10 “Russia threatens nuclear power plants”
26203	61	"Russian soldiers have been ordered to ""monitor and monitor"" these facilities to avoid unintentional or deliberate damage. Photos show the Ukrainians fired the first shot, destroying a Russian tank, to which a second tank returned fire. A training building was damaged in the exchange. The fires were not near the reactors. The electricity for cooling has never been cut off. But the hype was made to scare the shit out of Europe, in order to get it to intervene in the war in Ukraine.[14]"
26203	63	(11) “The invasion of Russia threatens the whole world”.
26203	65	"If Russia can prevent US nuclear missiles from being positioned in Ukraine a seven-minute flight from Moscow, it will be doing humanity a great favor. Just as the US's fixed ICBM missiles are on alert with orders to ""launch or lose"" with no cancellation after launch, missiles in Ukraine would increase the possibility of accidents or miscalculations on short notice. to verify."
26203	67	Judgment day would be on pins and needles. This should scare the shit out of everyone. In March, India carried out an accidental missile launch that landed in nuclear-armed Pakistan without a warhead. [Putin warned in 2019 that any incoming missile would presumably be nuclear, requiring a retaliatory launch by Russia before the incoming missile hit, so as not to destroy Russia's deterrence force. [16]
26203	69	(12) It is the United States and NATO that threaten the planet, not Russia. Here are the facts:
26203	71	"President Reagan rejected President Gorbachev's offer to abandon the deployment of a ""Star Wars"" missile defense system in space as a condition of both countries' elimination of all nuclear weapons."
26203	73	President Clinton rejected President Putin's offer to reduce our massive nuclear arsenals to 1,500 bombs each and to invite all other nuclear-weapon states to negotiate the elimination of all nuclear weapons, in exchange for US would not have placed missile sites in Romania.
26203	75	President George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and placed a missile base in Romania.

26203	89	"(13) ""The United States has a 'free press' while Russia's news is controlled."""
26203	91	US news is owned by billionaire Wall Street oligarchs who give so-called reporters the script to report, making TV reporters paid actors who know where their bread is. The US media has proven to be more dangerous and bellicose than the Pentagon, as demonstrated by past US wars (Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Yemen, Afghanistan).
26203	93	Now these billionaires are censoring social media, so we're censored from doing personal searches. The United States shut down Russian media outlets such as Tass and Russia Today (RT) to prevent Americans from listening to the other side and deciding for themselves who is lying and who is telling the truth. What is the United States afraid of if it tells the truth? According to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carl Bernstein, the CIA has captured the New York Times and the Washington Post.

26203	97	"Russia remains open to cybersecurity dialogue and cooperation with all states, and the United States is no exception,” the Kremlin's Andrey Krutskikh told Newsweek.

26204	5	China's official position on the Ukrainian issue is in support of the Minsk agreements, which established a compromise acceptable to the parties.
26204	7	"Beijing has not explicitly pronounced itself on the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, as it is inclined to support only bilateral agreements between the contenders and not de facto situations. However, the Chinese defense minister stated that the United States is ""guilty of the escalation of the conflict"" in Ukraine and, therefore, of its ""Syrianization""."
26204	9	Critiques of American subversive action
26204	11	Did China criticize the coup in Kiev that ousted the legitimate president Yanukovy? and the double standard, always enforced by the Americans, that if Russia complains when bases are set up on her borders then the independent states can do as they please. China, on the other hand, if it sets up naval bases in the Solomon Islands or in Equatorial Guinea, threatens the security of the USA, even if these are thousands of kilometers away and sometimes tens of thousands of kilometers away.
26204	13	China has refrained from condemning Russia, disapproving of the illegal sanctions the US and its vassals have inflicted on Moscow. The United States can steal other people's or states' money at any time, when it doesn't like something, as Afghanistan also teaches, but other countries cannot oppose it.
26204	15	It is evident that the United States miscalculated the consequences of the war. Western sanctions were based on the false premise that the Russian economy was highly vulnerable. The changes in the Russian economy in recent years have been ignored. Westerners have believed in a myth of their own making. Instead of crushing Russia, their sanctions have led to rampant inflation at home and Biden is all but certain to lose the midterm elections. Europe is even worse off. Support for Ukraine is choking the West with inflation, the likes of which have not been seen in years.
26204	17	"Chinese President Xi Jinping has criticized the unilateral sanctions, defined as ""arbitrary"", and their effects on developing countries, urging the ""major developed countries"" to adopt ""responsible"" economic policies. Speaking at the BRICS Business Forum, Xi said ""facts have shown time and time again that sanctions are a 'boomerang' and a 'double-edged sword'."" Those who ""politicize, manipulate and arm the world economy exploit the dominance of the international financial and monetary system to impose arbitrary sanctions, ultimately harm themselves, others and the whole world""."
26204	19	"According to US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, Beijing should follow the trade restrictions that Washington has imposed on Moscow ""as punishment"" for having conducted the ""special operation"" in Ukraine. US demands on China were expressed in the form of an ultimatum. China should follow the rules set by the Americans. However, the Chinese authorities do not accept these ultimatums. Therefore, Beijing has promised to take retaliatory measures against American companies and individuals in case of pressure from the United States."
26204	21	China strongly opposes any unilateral US sanctions and the application of the principle of extraterritoriality, Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhao Lijian said at a briefing.
26204	23	Concerns for Russia's security
26204	25	Above all, China understands Russia's security concerns. He understands how the expansion of NATO, the militarization of the eastern borders is a real threat against Moscow, with missiles with possible nuclear warheads aimed at Russian territory just a few minutes from the target.
26204	27	"The Americans have made verbal promises not to extend NATO to the eastern borders. Since the time of the Indian wars, the Yankees have spoken with ""forked tongues"", as the Indian chiefs used to say. Just listen to what they say about recognizing the ""One China"" policy and then follow their actions in Taiwan."
26204	29	What NATO has created is a situation of extreme insecurity for Russia. American diplomat George Kennan, the strategist of policy against the USSR, had foreseen this war if NATO began eastward expansion. Realist diplomats such as Henry Kissinger had warned to take Russian needs into account.
26204	31	"Pope Francis himself reported that a ""wise"" head of state, whom he met two months before the start of the conflict, had expressed his concern about NATO's ""barking"" on the borders of Russian space. The garrison of that space would never allow other powers to get too close. A war would have ensued, as it did."
26204	33	Chinese proposals
26204	35	"China proposes to form a security architecture, so that regional and global needs are taken into account, taking into account the concerns of each actor. Xi also told Putin that Beijing ""actively promotes world peace and the stability of the global economic order."" According to a Chinese political scientist, the reason why a great power is indeed a great power, or is considered such, lies not in its ability to challenge the old order, let alone in its ability to wage war, but in its ability and responsibility to advance while maintaining international peace."
26204	37	Beijing is fighting for a sustainable regional security system that should also be Europe's priority.
26204	39	Countries dominated by the USA
26204	41	China would like a more autonomous Europe from Washington. An unreasonably submissive US policy leads to the weakening of Europe and the strengthening of the United States. Washington exploits the traditional enemies of European integration, namely the United Kingdom and Poland, to force Europe to follow them. The Americans widely use the Baltic statelets as agents provocateur, primarily Lithuania, which has also provoked China with a sort of recognition of Taiwan. The US is banking on these servile states to use against Beijing and possibly Russia. Think of the provocations of Canadians with spy planes on the border with China, of Australians in the Solomon Islands and of Lithuanians with the threatened blockade of Kaliningrad against Russia. NATO has become a private tool of the US, or perhaps it always has been.
26204	43	China applies active neutrality by recognizing everyone's needs. It does not take an active part either with sanctions or with military aid. It does not break agreements with Europe and Russia, but China has made constant criticisms of NATO and the US. Beijing has recognized that this conflict has deep roots. The week does not start on Sunday but on Monday, and Monday dates 2014. This does not mean that we necessarily agree on the military intervention, but we do recognize the reasons for it.
26204	45	For Beijing, a negotiating path based on compromise must be found. The preconditions are emancipation from the logic of the blocs and the cold war. Multilateralism, dialogue and international collaboration must be implemented in mutual respect. The hallmarks of China's foreign policy - cooperation, multilateralism, economic growth, new globalization based on mutual benefit, competition, the rule of international law, peaceful ascendancy - are all that the United States and its throwaway friends don't want.
26204	47	Strengthening of cooperation with Russia
26204	49	"Washington's pressure to separate China from Russia is unacceptable. China, on the other hand, is focusing on strengthening collaboration with Russia not as a new alliance opposed to someone else, but as a strategic partnership. Beijing cannot accept the destabilization of Moscow, much less collaborate to achieve this goal. As has been said, the Americans' proposal is: ""help us take out the Russians because then we can concentrate on taking you out"". Moreover, the American engagement against Russia will significantly slow the shift of US strategic energies from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, favoring China. China everywhere stands up against the policies of regime change promoted from outside."
26204	51	Although Beijing is committed to improving relations with the West and with Russia, the result is that these improve with Moscow and worsen with the West. Relations with the non-aligned world also improve. There are elements of economic complementarity between Russia and China, furthermore the two countries agree on multilateralism and the overcoming of the unipolar world. The main factor of this relationship lies in mutual respect, unlike the Sino-US relationship, where the US seeks to dominate and contain China. Russia and China are neighbors and each knows very well that it is not possible to move the other to another place, so the only solution for these two nuclear states is to cooperate and help each other. China is strong in manufacturing and technology, Russia has vast natural resources including some of the components needed in the semiconductor industry, and is also a large country with high agricultural production potential.
26204	53	Chinese officials have said that relations and cooperation between China and Russia will be further strengthened. During the recent conversation with Putin, Xi Jinping noted that, since the beginning of this year, bilateral relations have maintained a solid development momentum in the face of global turmoil and transformation. Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has made significant progress. The Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge has opened to traffic, creating a new canal connecting the two countries.
26204	55	Xi and Putin also spoke about the Ukrainian issue. Xi stressed that China has always independently assessed the situation based on the historical context and the merits of the matter, and has actively promoted world peace and the stability of the global economic order. All sides should push for a proper resolution of the Ukraine crisis in a responsible manner, Xi said, adding that China will continue to play its rightful role in this regard. A negotiated peace is the best outcome for all. China, as one of the few major powers that is formally neutral in this conflict, could have a great opportunity to help broker a peaceful solution. Zelensky's positions on Taiwan certainly don't help, on the contrary they sound like a clear provocation.
26204	57	The Marxist point of view
26204	59	China is willing to work with Russia on their respective sovereignty and security goals, deepening their strategic coordination and strengthening joint action in major international and regional organizations such as the United Nations, the BRICS mechanism and the Organization for the Cooperation of Shanghai. China is also willing to work with Russia to promote solidarity and cooperation between emerging and developing nations, push for the development of international order and global governance in a more just and reasonable direction. In this there is full agreement with Putin who wants coordination with China to achieve a more equitable international order.
26204	61	From a Marxist point of view, today it is important to form a system of international alliances to overthrow the hegemonic unipolar order headed by the United States, to bring out a new counter-hegemonic order that gives space to emerging countries. Each country acquired in this fight constitutes a new mighty fortress and pillbox. The struggle for the multipolar world is the form that class struggle takes in the 21st century. Putin's declaration that the future belongs to sovereign countries is already a revolutionary stance in itself. China does not have a modern colonialist and imperialist tradition, but if anything, it is the country where the most important anti-colonial and anti-imperialist revolution in history took place.
26204	63	Those who argue, in the left field, that the Ukrainian conflict is simply inter-imperialist, exclusively for the struggle for markets and raw materials or worse, like the pop philosopher Slavoj Žižek, who advocate the strengthening of NATO, are objectively on the side of the 'imperialism. The failure to see the national component of class issues and the class component of national issues, as the Russian Communists claim, leads directly to sterile and cowardly doctrinairism if not to the camp of the enemy. The struggle of Donbass is, in this context, a struggle for national liberation.
26204	65	"Patriotism, the national question and the national liberation movement were the true figure of the communist and revolutionary movement in the 20th century. The October Revolution immediately became a national liberation struggle after the invasion by numerous countries (including Italy) in support of the ""white"" counter-revolutionaries."
26204	67	"We can speak of the Russian Civil War as the First Patriotic War. We must remember that towards the end of the civil war Soviet Russia was even invaded by Poland, that Japan left Siberia only in 1926 and that from 1932 to 1939 it attacked the USSR three times, taking advantage of the weak conditions from which it had emerged from the civil war. The same Workers' Opposition to the Brest Peace is made in the name of ""red patriotism""."
26204	69	"Already during the civil war the budënovka became the distinctive feature of the Workers 'and Peasants' Red Army and in particular of the First Cavalry Army (the famous Konarmija: ""Army on horseback"") of Semën Budënnyj, Kliment Voroshilov and Stalin. The budënovka (from Budënnyj) refers to the traditional headdress of the bogatyr (originally bogatyrka) the legendary fighters of the Slavic tradition. The image they wanted to give was that of the ""red bogatyrs"" fighting the old and corrupt Russian system and the foreign invader, as the greatest of the bogatyrs, Ilya Muromets, had done."
26204	71	Until Fanja Kaplan's assassination attempt on Lenin, the Bolsheviks set up a coalition government with the left-wing social revolutionaries, a sort of ante litteram Popular Front, seeking to extend the alliances of the working class. The end of the civil war is generally indicated with the capture of Vladivostok and the liberation of the entire Soviet homeland in October 1922.
26204	73	"Lenin writes, against the Western left communists who make fun of the ""defence of the fatherland"" in Soviet Russia, that: ""to recognize the defense of the fatherland means to recognize that a war is just or unjust. We have been defenders of the fatherland since October 25, 1917. It is precisely to strengthen the link with the international proletariat that we are in defense of the socialist fatherland. The war to defend socialism is legitimate and 'sacred'"". Not to mention Trotsky who writes: ""When power is in the hands of the workers, patriotism becomes a revolutionary duty"". It is Trotsky himself who still speaks in the 1930s of a ""new Soviet patriotism"", a sentiment ""certainly very deep, sincere and dynamic""."
26204	75	End of liberal globalization
26204	77	"What has been lacking in Western ideology is trust in the globalization of markets, as a lock pick to impose a single narrative based on the liberal philosophy of history. The ultimate, eschatological, goal would have been to make all other civilizations disappear by unifying humanity on the basis of individualism, ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" as understood in the West. But American liberals have lost the fight for globalization, so they fall back on the usual tricks such as economic protectionism disguised as the protection of human rights, the imposition on satellite countries of policies contrary to their interests and of course war. This objective finds ever greater resistance, it cannot be imposed peacefully and it is for this reason that peace is increasingly in danger."
26204	79	"The Western bloc directed by Washington, the United Kingdom and their vassals seeks to encircle China and Russia, with the QUOD and AUKUS system, therefore the anti-imperialist and anti-hegemonic struggle is in the common interest of the two Eurasian countries. The American hegemonic attempt had already begun with the Pivot to Asia of the ""Nobel Peace Prize"" Barack Obama."
26204	81	"We are already, willy-nilly, in a multipolar world, and many emerging countries no longer depend strictly on the West. The behavior of the American-led NATO shows that the United States is no longer able to maintain the world order which is developing towards a progressive pluralism, the so-called ""deep pluralism"". Today's world is conditioned not only by Xi's China, but also by Putin's Russia, Modi's India, Erdogan's Turkey. Perhaps even France, Germany and Italy in the EU could have something to say if they looked at their real interests. Then there are the emerging countries (Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa) which trust the West less and less and in particular in Washington which no longer enjoys universal legitimacy and trust in the world. Sanctions, the result of deglobalization, seek to isolate emerging countries, ending up isolating the West. The predatory activities of liberal countries are now badly tolerated. If the West wants to live worse and fight in defense of operetta Nazis, that doesn't mean that everyone in the world does. Technologies no longer come exclusively from the West. China is also advancing in the technological field and can make its assets available to those who resist and want to emancipate themselves from Western tutelage. China will strengthen its friendship with Russia and the result will in the long run be the isolation of the West."
26204	83	There are also interesting elements from Russia such as the attempt to disengage from the dollar through payments in rubles. This is important because through the dominance of the dollar and technology the West exercises its power over the world. The proposal made at the BRICS summit of an alternative currency is certainly interesting. Through internationalization, the RMB-Yuan is now accepted as a reserve currency by the IMF and the fourth world currency and this also goes in a direction common to that of Moscow. The e-yuan also goes in this perspective. We are witnessing a planning of the use of currency, under the strict control of the monetary authorities in Beijing, which is used for investments in particular in the Silk Road and, therefore, in the real economy rather than in the financialized economy. Since 2016, the Monetary Fund has officially accepted and recognized the RMB-Yuan on a par with the dollar, the pound, the euro and the yen.
26204	85	"Even the experience of sanctions can be useful given that by now there are many sanctioned countries (with increasingly arbitrary sanctions) and therefore it is useful to resort to one's own currency and to an alternative system to SWIFT, against the real debt traps, those created by the IMF and company. It was noted, perhaps for the first time, that Western positions are not universal, and few developing or emerging countries share the American agenda. The German newspaper Welt writes: “Moscow is supported by China, India, Brazil and South Africa, which, together with Russia, produce a third of the world's economic product. More than ever, they receive fertilizer, energy and weapons from Russia."" Saudi Arabia and the UAE are also largely neutral and have done little so far to increase their oil production. It can be said that the majority of countries in the world have not followed the West in sanctions against Moscow."
26204	87	The not unanimous consensus towards the American positions can also be seen in the extraordinary success of the Belt and Road Initiative which now extends to more than one hundred countries.
26204	89	"That China and Russia have more than one point of contact became clear with the overthrow of Imran Khan in Pakistan, after meeting with Putin, bearing in mind that he also had a very good relationship with China. The former Premier has openly denounced how the USA is behind his dismissal. China and Russia also have the common goal of countering Islamist terrorism which in the past has caused major problems in Chechnya and Xinjiang. The West defends the ""good"" Muslims, those who attack their enemies after they have massacred Muslims all over the world. US policy tends to create instability in the world to harm its opponents who instead demand stability, this will only drive more and more countries of the world away from the US-led western circus."
26204	91	If more and more countries among the former non-aligned do not join the pro-American front, the multipolar world will grow and unilateralist arrogance will become more problematic to apply.
26206	1	For critics of Russia's strategy in Ukraine
26206	3	A common theme used to “prove” that Russia is failing in its war against Ukraine is that Russia failed to take Kiev quickly, in fact it was forced to withdraw from Kiev. Furthermore, the military analysts who populate the US cable news insist that the Russians are bogged down and not making the rapid progress they (the Russians) expected.
26206	5	"These are trifles. I defy anyone to show me a statement from Putin or the Russian General Staff in which a specific timeline was established or identified. This is a construct of Western military analysts who have no access to Russia's military plans and who use their wishful thinking as ""evidence"" of a Russian military in crisis."
26206	7	But it's not just Western military analysts who are playing Debbie Downer's dirge. A famous blogger with many supporters in Russia, Strelkov [Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, also known as Igor Ivanovich Strelkov], is also pushing the narrative that Russia is bogged down in Donbass. He'll say more about Strelkov in a moment.
26206	9	I find it amusing that the retired American generals and colonels who populate Fox, CNN, MSNBC and Newsmax are busy criticizing tactics they themselves have never employed. The last time the United States was on a battlefield fighting an organized army with a powerful air force, artillery and tanks was in Korea. Most of these guys (for example, General Keane) wore diapers or went to elementary school. None of them were on that battlefield.
26206	11	The war experience of the United States from 1960 onwards was against Third World militaries, which lacked a modern air force or armored troops of a certain size. The one that came closest to a war against a real army was the one against North Vietnam. But the North Vietnamese as a fighting tactic against the US Army relied more on numerical superiority and the US withdrew its combat units from Vietnam when the North Vietnamese invaded the South and defeated the South Vietnamese . (I want to add that American troops in Vietnam, for the most part, had fought bravely despite a military and political leadership that betrayed their sacrifice. It is not un-American to ask the question: What did they die for?)
26206	13	"Russia is not playing into the hands of the United States. When George W. Bush launched the ""shock and awe"" attack on Iraq in March 2003, media briefings and images from the front had played a large part in convincing the American public that our multi-billion-dollar army dollars was relentlessly mowing down the Iraqi forces. It was only after Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" speech that Americans had to come to terms with the fact that they did not control Iraq and that there was a strong insurgency movement."
26206	15	So what am I trying to say? That the Russian military leadership and Vladimir Putin waste no time in giving reporters daily information on the number of corpses of Ukrainian fighters or showing footage of drones destroying Ukrainian trenches.
26206	17	Americans delude themselves that they have a free and dynamic press. Yet military analysts such as Scott Ritter and Doug MacGregor are rarely invited to appear on cable broadcasts to offer an alternative viewpoint to the narrative being fed to a gullible and ignorant public. I will repeat a remark I made at the beginning of the Russian campaign regarding the famous 40-mile-long Russian column which had stood still for more than a week north of Kiev. US analysts had insisted that was evidence of Russian incompetence in keeping those tanks and trucks fueled. Yet all the while that big fat Russian target had been exposed, the mighty Ukrainian army had failed to launch any organized attack of any significance to destroy that column.
26206	19	This is not a minor point. No Ukrainian aircraft (fixed or rotary wing) had attacked the column. No Ukrainian artillery units had shelled the Russian tanks and trucks in plain sight. And no Ukrainian armored units had attacked the seemingly bottled-up Russians. Because? Because Ukraine did not have the capabilities to carry out such attacks.
26206	21	What was Russia doing? Ritter, MacGregor and Martyanov, among others (including yours truly), interpreted it as a diversionary maneuver designed to pin down Ukrainian forces entrenched around Kiev as Russia prepares to concentrate on the Donbass and southern littoral Ukraine .
26206	23	Which brings me back to Mr. Strelkov, who writes:
26206	25	It was a week of minimal earnings. Also, the earnings have come to the wrong area. Mostly the gains were north of the Seversky Donets River. Meanwhile, the Izyum bridgehead, south of the river, from which the thrust should start, has remained static (contained). . . .
26206	27	These are obvious facts to anyone, so the new script is that Russia would be eliminating 500 Ukrainians a day. Except there's no way the Russians have access to this information, and if you believe that Rybar Telegram actually has access to the Ukrainian documents, you should be in a brain-damaged institution.
26206	29	It's the old and still valid Vietnam strategy, I think. When you can't show any real progress in the field, you resort to fake body counts. Body counts do not win wars, and Ukraine can replace its losses. Russia cannot. Any men Ukraine loses will be replaced. Those lost by Russia, for the most part, will not be.
26206	31	Mr. Strelkov is assuming that Russia's goal is to quickly conquer the Donbass, regardless of the losses of its own troops. Putin is not Stalin. Stalin had not hesitated to literally send millions of men to slaughter in order to stop the Germans. Putin and his generals are moving in a much more methodical and cautious way. The Russians rely on artillery and airstrikes to soften up Ukrainian defensive positions. And this is paying off. Ukrainian troops are surrendering in significant numbers, especially those that have recently entered service and are not integrated with neo-Nazi mercenary forces.
26206	33	"I am particularly perplexed by Strelkov's statement that ""Ukraine can replace its losses."" Mr. Strelkov can't be that stupid. Recruiting 60-year-old Ukrainians is no proof of a robust military response. Instead, he reeks of Hitlerian desperation. In the last days of the Third Reich, Hitler had scoured Berlin for old and young to man positions no longer defended by regular German forces. Ukrainian President Zelensky had embarked on a similar strategy even before the Russian ""special operation"":"
26206	35	On Wednesday, Ukraine's ground forces announced that they had begun recalling members of their operational reserves with immediate effect. Reservists between the ages of 18 and 60 were mobilized for one year.
26206	37	Russia is not sitting around licking its wounds. Rather than sending troops into fortified positions, Russia continues to strike targets across Ukraine with precision missiles. Here is the activity reported on May 4:
26206	39	– Russia attacked a railway substation in Pyatihatki with a high-precision missile;
26206	41	– Russia attacked a railway substation in Tymkove with a high-precision missile;
26206	43	– Russia attacked a railway substation in Volovets with a high-precision missile;
26206	45	– Russia attacked a railway substation in Lviv with a high-precision missile;
26206	47	– Russia attacked a railway substation in Pidbirtsi with a high-precision missile;
26206	49	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Protopopovka with a high-precision missile;
26206	51	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Novaya Dmitrovka with a high-precision missile;
26206	53	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Sandjeika with a high-precision missile;
26206	55	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Krysino with a high-precision missile;
26206	57	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Volnyansk with a high-precision missile;
26206	59	– Russia attacked AFU military assets near Novoalexandrovka with a high-precision missile.
26206	61	I know for a fact that, two weeks ago, US military commanders hoped that Russia had depleted its stockpile of precision missiles. Hope is not a good strategy. The Russians apparently did not get that memo (and Ukrainian sources confirmed these attacks).
26206	63	Further evidence that Russia is opting for the “reach out and touch someone” strategy comes from a video shot tonight (May 4) of a bombing in Mykolaev aka Nikolaev:
26206	65	If you think that enduring this kind of bombardment is child's play, then you know nothing of the limits of human resistance to such a sustained barrage.
26206	67	I'm not saying that the Russians aren't meeting fierce resistance from some Ukrainian units. But I am offering an alternative explanation for the Russian land strategy. They don't have a deadline. They are not going to send their military units into frontal assaults and risk unnecessary losses. And they will relentlessly bomb Ukrainian units until they surrender or are destroyed. Time is on Putin's side.
26206	69	The greatest failure of Western military analysts is their failure to take into account the fact that Ukraine's economy has been wiped out. Ukraine cannot export or import anything from the south and depends on what Europe and the US can send overland. Fuel supplies in Ukraine are becoming scarcer, not more plentiful. Given these realities, can Ukraine feed its people? This, in the coming days, will be a critical factor.
26207	1	EMA and ECDC say yes for the 4th dose. Meanwhile, 2 million reports of vaccine damage in the last year alone
26207	3	- VACCINE DAMAGE DOUBLE IN JUST ONE YEAR THROUGHOUT EUROPE
26207	5	The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) declare their approval for the administration of the fourth dose of vaccine to the over 60s and frail.
26207	7	"The EU Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, in concert, calls on the Member States to immediately launch a further call, adding that ""this is how we protect ourselves, our loved ones and our vulnerable populations""."
26207	9	In fact, it is the official green light and the excuse for a further vaccination campaign. Minister Speranza did not wait and already today declared an adjustment to the guidelines to push the related operations immediately, and convened an emergency summit with AIFA and the Scientific Technical Committee.
26207	11	But in the midst of the ferment, no one talks about the downside, which together with the infections, causes the damage from the Covid vaccine to increase dramatically: in the last year alone (July 2021 > July 2022) the EMA, through Eudravigilance, records almost 2 million adverse reactions, more than double the previous year.
26207	13	It is not the first time that we have tried to delve into the databases offered by the bodies which, for transparency, should also monitor the adverse reactions caused by taking medicines and vaccines.
26207	15	Exactly one year ago, more precisely on July 23, 2021, we published an article highlighting the almost 19,000 deaths recorded by EudraVigilance following the intake of Covid vaccines, out of a total of over 700,000 reports of adverse reactions.
26207	17	Just the next day, we immediately published an update as the deaths of only one week declared by the official site showed a +862.
26207	19	Since then, what has changed, other than the addition of the fifth NOVAVAX vaccine?
26207	21	The numbers are there, all to be read, in their raw reality. EudraVigilance maintains indicative data for the last year and to ensure we have downloaded the available spreadsheet formats from the database:
26207	23	- COVID-19 MODERN VACCINE MRNA (CX-024414): 312.013
26207	25	- COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE PFIZER-BIONTECH (TOZINAMERAN): 1.043.308
26207	27	- COVID-19 ASTRAZENECA VACCINE (CHADOX1 NCOV-19): 506,221
26207	29	- COVID-19 VACCINES JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S): 65,669
26207	31	- COVID-19 VACCINE NOVAVAX (NVX-COV2373): 1,117
26207	33	for a total of:
26207	35	1,928,328
26207	37	reports of adverse reactions to listed vaccines.
26207	39	"These are the data updated to July 9, 2022 that anyone can read on the EudraVigilance website, which we remember is the ""centralized European database of suspected adverse reactions to medicines authorized or under study in clinical trials in the European Economic Area""."
26207	41	The numbers speak for themselves: from July 2021 to July 2022 those who suffered an adverse reaction to a vaccine fed a pool of patients enough to see the number more than double compared to the previous year.
26207	43	How many deaths are there? If from July 2020 to today we can roughly count over 2.6 million adverse reactions, if official deaths a year ago amounted to 19 thousand, how many are there today?
26207	45	In October 2021 another update was put online and spoke of 27,242 deaths across Europe, an increase of 44% in just over two months.
26207	47	And Italy is between fourth and eighth, only second if we count reports of reactions to the more recent NOVAVAX.
26207	49	Faced with these numbers, we wonder why there is so much silence especially from the press, but also from a good part of the scientific and medical community.
26207	51	It seems more than clear that the vaccination campaign conducted so far has shown numerous shortcomings, given that the number of infected people, mostly vaccinated in the third dose, is becoming infected again.
26207	53	The searches on EudraVigilance have also highlighted numerous cases of death, including for minors.
26207	55	Clearly protected by privacy, following the instructions that we have already provided through the news of a year ago, it is possible to get to the individual case files: children in the 3/11 age range, but also deaths of newborn children who have suffered the effects of vaccination for maternal-fetal transmission.
26207	57	And we are talking about cases dating back to May 17 and June 30, 2022.
26207	59	The vaccine, also for obvious issues of diffusion, which has caused the most damage is always the Pfizer vaccine.
26207	61	The tables available to EudraVigilance also highlight this data:
26207	63	"The major cases are collected in the ""General disorders and administration site conditions"", i.e. ""a class of disorders that includes conditions of a general type that derive from a disease, from the treatment of a disease or from the administration of a treatment in a particular site and manifest with a characteristic set of symptoms and signs""."
26207	65	"Of these, about 40% are classified as ""serious"", and it is here that the greatest deaths are also recorded, and only for this reaction group, for the Pfizer vaccine:"
26207	67	We stop in our analysis not for lack of will, but simply because we would like those data to be read directly from the source by anyone who does not want to turn their heads away, because they are not directly affected by the tragedy of a serious adverse reaction or death.
26207	69	"Certainly the words of Minister Speranza make us think who, just today, speaking at the twelfth congress of Uil Pensionati and immediately after learning of the go-ahead from ECDC and EMA, declares «Woe to think that the battle against Covid is won, it is still in progress and we must maintain a level of attention and prudence""."
26207	71	We wonder where the prudence is in the face of the above data, and the continuous news of infections with variants that from time to time are declared less virulent than the previous ones.
26208	1	Letta, freedom and the vaccine
26208	3	I quote Enrico Letta's words at a PD demonstration I was present at:
26208	5	"“The vaccine is freedom, the vaccine is freedom because this word – freedom – has been used inappropriately many, too many times; the vaccine is freedom to go to school; the vaccine is the freedom to work, to earn; the vaccine is the freedom to meet others, the vaccine is the freedom to travel; the vaccine is the freedom to have fun, the vaccine is the freedom to play sports; the vaccine is freedom to enjoy shows, to enjoy the resumption of cultural activities. Those who do not want to be vaccinated are against the freedom of others and cannot be rewarded, and those who are ambiguous about green passes and vaccinations are against the health of Italians and those who are ambiguous against green passes and vaccinations are against businesses, against workers and against entrepreneurs, and it is useless for those who are ambiguous about vaccines and green passes to then go parading in front of business associations to promise who knows what. The most important thing is this and then we, we are proudly the party of workers and entrepreneurs because we have always been consistent on the most important thing today: that is, the vaccine is freedom, it is the vaccine that is freedom ""."
26208	7	I listened to that speech carefully, and even with some trepidation, as I have personal memories of when Letta was a boy and played wonderfully well football in the streets of Porta Lucca. I was struck by the fact that that ex-boyfriend, who kept the appearance and very often also the mental habit of an Oxford student, repeated 13 times in just over 2 minutes that the vaccine is freedom. that is, he adopted one of those stratagems resorted to by politicians who have little cultural baggage and who go before the crowd armed with a single sentence, which they repeat endlessly, as if the repetition revealed their strength and not, on the contrary, the argumentative weakness.
26208	9	And perhaps it is a ploy of anyone, learned or not, who ventures into fields that are not his own and has to proclaim an act of faith in front of a crowd on which he would not be able to argue, because he himself believes more by faith in those who formulate that assertion than for having examined the data with a certain competence.
26208	11	Has the vaccine given us back our freedom? Yes and no.
26208	13	You could give them credit for giving us back our freedom if these vaccinations had the ability to block infections, to prevent transmission.
26208	15	It is not so!
26208	17	The vaccine confers protection from infection, very good/good after the first 14 days after inoculation, however it declines months after the 2nd dose, until it is zeroed and even reversed, in the sense that fully vaccinated subjects become even less protected from infection compared to the unvaccinated. This paradoxical evolution is accelerated with the Omicron variant, especially in children and against asymptomatics.
26208	19	It's not true that the vaccine is the freedom to go to school because for children aged 5 to 11 the risk of falling ill with COVID is 40% greater for the vaccinated than for the unvaccinated. (ISS data)
26208	21	It's not true that the vaccine is the freedom to earn and work because from 18 to 69 years old (working age) the risk of getting sick with COVID is 4 times greater in vaccinated people with 3 doses than in unvaccinated people. (Data from the English Ministry of Health). It is the trivaccinated workers and entrepreneurs who are more sensitive to the infection, and the party that would like to represent them should know that in Italy workers aged 40 to 59 have a 10% greater risk of falling ill if vaccinated with a full cycle compared to non- vaccinated (ISS data).
26208	23	The current vaccine is unable to preserve the health of others, indeed in the medium and long term, repeated vaccinations even seem counterproductive for this purpose.
26208	25	It is not necessary to be doctors, it is enough to be politicians prepared to examine vaccination policies, to ask questions about the fact that in June 2022, with vaccination coverage among the highest in the world, we have more cases than last year, when the number of vaccinated was lower. Perhaps there would also have been something to say about the 180 million doses purchased last year to which are added the 138 million of this year and which are expiring in the collection centers.
26208	27	Being prepared politicians also includes examining tools and strategies to prevent the explosion of pandemics: vaccinations are not enough, we will not always be able to have the right vaccine available, and I mean right, meaning a vaccine useful for categories at risk, but without guarantees whether the benefits actually outweigh the risks.
26208	29	Invoking the freedom of the vaccinated is a statement that can make sense. Provided we forget that in many European countries, which have had no more or less our number of victims, and perhaps some less rather than some more, freedom has been achieved in a sense much more consistent with this concept . To me, who am of another generation, one might say that in many European countries freedom was achieved in a much more respectful way than a principle dear to Gramsci when he wrote that the main problem of a free man is everyone's freedom, and that the freedom of some is the opposite of the freedom of all.
26208	31	In Italy the vaccine has been made mandatory for health professionals and it has been for many other categories of citizens. Freedom and obligation are principles that presuppose a radically different vision of the relationship between the state and the citizen: the green pass can be defended and proclaimed an instrument of freedom, repeating the phrase ad infinitum, but if we have to tackle the subject with a minimum of juridical rigour, then it is impractical to put the two things together because if you didn't have the green pass you wouldn't work, which, if you allow me, was an even more subtle way of infringing on freedom in terms of vaccination choices: in this way we even avoided assume responsibility for imposing the vaccination obligation, i.e. responsibility for any short, medium or long-term negative effects of the vaccine, which like all medicines always has contraindications, side effects, the need for an evaluation in terms of costs and benefits.
26208	33	The State has chosen for us, evaluated for us, thought for us. But formally without ever being called into question, without one day someone being able to charge him with anything since he didn't impose the vaccine, but the green pass, without which he didn't do anything anymore.
26208	35	It is a strange kind of freedom, dear Letta, that which, suddenly oblivious to the principle of non-contradiction, you are proposing to the crowds. And if you allow me, I refuse it because by not doing politics I can allow myself the luxury of still remaining attached to the logical coherence and the principle of provability of a thesis only when it passes the analysis of the facts, i.e. of scientific data, as many times as it is can repeat or flaunt.
26209	1	"Covid, scientific article examines the evidence on the consequences of vaccines: ""they are neither safe nor effective"""
26209	3	In an article published in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research, John W. Oller Jr., Professor Emeritus of the University of New Mexico, and Daniel Santiago, a pharmacist of Orlando, Florida, examine “the evidence regarding consequences of the still ongoing worldwide experimental use of genetic vaccines ostensibly to stop the spread of pathological conditions attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants”.
26209	5	"“Looking at the experimental data on anti-Covid injections, it emerges that these ""vaccines"" are neither safe nor effective. For example, on the effectiveness of booster doses, the UK Health Service publication titled “COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report Week 42,” on page 23, states: “Recent observations from Safety Agency surveillance data Health Authority (UKHSA) reported that N [natural rather than S, Spike] antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who become infected after 2 doses of vaccination (UK Health Security Agency, 2021) . Similarly, a Pfizer study published in the Lancet by (Tartof et al., 2021) reported the following change after “full vaccination” defined as “two doses of BNT162b2 with 7 or more days after the second dose: the vaccine efficacy against infections for the fully vaccinated decreased with increasing time after vaccination, decreasing from 88% during the first month after full vaccination to 47% after 5 months,” Oller's article reads. Jr. and Santiago."
26209	7	“Another study, recently published by Cohn et al. (2022), suggests that the administrations interfere with the innate ability of the organism after a SARS-CoV-2 infection to produce antibodies against the virus. One theoretical possibility is that people vaccinated against Covid may not produce antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the virus shell, which is, in theory, an integral component needed in antibodies for a successful immune response to defeat variants of the virus. Covid ”, it still reads.
26209	9	"“It is already evident that flawed, non-sterilizing and non-neutralizing vaccines that can reduce symptoms, but not stop infection or transmission, can certainly create conditions that can make the disease more severe (Seneff and Nigh, 2021). It is imperative that physicians remain vigilant about the problems that arise from experimental substances, regardless of the pervasive propaganda that essentially all ""vaccines"" are ""safe and effective."" Evidence shows that some ""vaccines"" can make a ""vaccinated individual"" more vulnerable to disease rather than less. If the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports are as reliable as they appear, the anti-Covid injections are by far the most dangerous ever produced in the history of vacciniology, or at least since the VAERS reporting system (Seneff et al., 2022)”, report Oller Jr. and Santiago."
26209	11	“Disappointingly, after billions of injections have been administered, according to Mitropoulos (2022): “An increasing percentage of deaths from Covid are occurring among the vaccinated.” However, the public narrative comes full circle: the solution to the deaths that have occurred since the beginning of the Covid era is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. At the end of the article, we read that “declining immunity again highlights the urgency of encouraging older Americans and high-risk Americans to take additional doses.” But how can the booster make things better if those who take more than one dose are actually becoming more vulnerable to Covid? And to make matters worse, they are more likely to die. Why do individuals who have had booster shots actually have fewer antibodies to the disease than more, according to the UK's Health Security Agency?” write the two authors of the paper.
26209	13	“What if the anti-Covid genetic vaccines were actually causing, not only the production of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, but disease and death? Something is killing many people who have already been vaccinated one or more times. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people, according to data from millions of people in the UK, die in far fewer numbers. This is evident by looking at the weekly reports from the UK's Health Security Agency. There are also experimental results suggesting that the anti-Covid vaccines themselves must be considered possible causal agents.
26209	15	“Given the results of Aldén et al. (2022), Liu (2021) and Seneff et al. (2022), growing evidence that the same anti-Covid injections not only create further disorders and pathological conditions, which could be debilitating within a few weeks and even fatal, some of which appear suddenly, in anaphylactic convulsions or in forms of sudden death in perfectly healthy people (Heilman, 2022), shouldn't we be thinking about the possibility that the shocking number of injuries and deaths reported by VAERS are really caused by the anti-Covid vaccines?” conclude Oller Jr. and Santiago.
2621	1	The European way towards the servitude of work and poverty: the useful indications of the Commission would be revolutionary
2621	3	Imagine if in the seventies of the last century a government had stated that it intended to contain inflation by squeezing the purchasing power of workers as much as possible by favoring illegal immigration. Surely it would not have ended well, if not with a revolution, with demonstrations that would have resulted in violence.
2621	5	"Today, with the usual nonchalance, as part of its spring recommendations, the ""Letters"", the Commission advises individual states NOT to adjust wages for inflation. How to get this result? With a facilitation of the regularization of migrants and their work, whether they are legal or not. So the deal proposed by the commission is: all workers must be objectively poorer, because their purchasing power drops very sharply."
2621	7	Among other things, a good part of these people are Ukrainian refugees who fled the war, who are therefore taken for granted will never be able to return home. So what is the use of sending weapons?
2621	9	"The Commission therefore sets out to protect a small class of privileged people and condemns all other European workers to poverty, using a very ancient tactic, which officially dates back to the end of the Roman Empire and which has never brought good luck in the past: yes they import workers to lower labor costs, even servile labor, and increase the yield of landowners. The Romans did it with the Goths and it ended very badly. But the Commission ignores, indeed despises, European history. They are willing to any economic and social brutality in order to reach their goals: the protection of the interests of a small minority that considers itself ""Elect"", superior to the laws of men and nature (see what they are up to with the Green Deal), against those of the democratic majority of Europeans."
2621	11	"This is truly the last trench for the personal and collective freedom of European citizens, and the last chance to save a semblance of well-being even for the most disadvantaged, the underprivileged. It would be necessary to vigorously oppose every policy wanted by this Commission, starting with the trust in the Draghi Government on the ""Competitiveness"" decree: a bad product of the government wanted only to please the bosses of Brussels and written to tax Italy (Cadastre) and expropriate their assets (Bolkenstein directive) If this means giving up the debts of the PNRR, employed in unproductive, useless things and to fatten the usual consultants, so much the better. Because the motto is always and only one: everything that comes from the Commission, which is not democratically elected, is bad and it cannot be otherwise. The ironic thing is that those who support these repressive policies, such as the PD, also call themselves ""leftist""."
26211	1	The “Insect Allies” program – DARPA's Pandora's Box
26211	3	"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to a global food crisis at a time of climate change, pollution and other threats to the food supply. In the near future, food problems are likely to be a global problem, while conflicts resulting from ""harvest wars"" will also become an international issue of major concern."
26211	5	"Since 2016, [DARPA] the United States Advanced Military Research Institute has been carrying out a defense program, known as “Insect Allies,” which it said was supposed to address potential risks associated with the food supply. However, [in this program] the Pentagon uses insects to insert ""genetically modified viruses"" [into the cellular DNA of plants], which could affect crop growth by altering the genes expressed by the plants themselves, according to media reports."
26211	7	"After the announcement, the plan had received widespread criticism from scientists and experts around the world, who had warned that ""Insect Allies"" could open an easily weaponized technological ""Pandora's box""."
26211	9	"Even the intentions of the Pentagon are not clear: is it really about saving humanity from starvation or, on the contrary, deliberately provoking a humanitarian crisis to pursue some ""military purpose""?"
26211	11	According to experts interviewed by Global Times, Insect Allies are turning this concern into a real danger. “Why do they use insects as vectors? Why is the United States building biological laboratories near other countries, such as Russia? When Pandora's box is opened, a series of disasters will follow,” said an expert.
26211	13	However, this is just the tip of the iceberg of a project that could easily turn into a biological weapon. In addition to the Insect Allies program, the United States has been conducting biological experiments around the world in its famed “bio-laboratories,” ignoring safety and ethical principles and flagrantly in violation of the “Biological Weapons Convention.”
26211	15	Insects become “biological weapons
26211	17	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of high-tech military applications.
26211	19	Ever since DARPA announced the Insect Allies program, in the name of disaster prevention and increasing agricultural productivity, the controversy around the proposal had never ceased.
26211	21	"According to DARPA's website, the program pursues ""scalable, readily implementable, and generalizable countermeasures"" against ""potential natural and engineered threats"" to the food supply, with the goal of preserving the U.S. agricultural system."
26211	23	According to DARPA, the program, by “applying targeted therapies,” seeks to mitigate the impact of possible threats to the crop system, including natural threats and those introduced by state or non-state actors,” that could rapidly threaten national security .
26211	25	According to DARPA, the Insect Allies program studies the possibility of modifying the genetic heritage of plants through vector insects and the plant viruses they transmit, involving three technical areas: viral manipulation, optimization of insect vectors and selective gene therapy in plants ripe.
26211	27	To achieve this goal, the $45 million project has funded at least four research institutes, as reported by the media.
26211	29	In 2017, one of Insect Allies' experiments reportedly involved corn and tomato plants and dispersive insect species, including grasshoppers, whiteflies (aleurodids) and aphids.
26211	31	However, the project and DARPA's intentions had not convinced the scientists. As early as April 2018, an article in Science warned that crop protector insects selected in the Insect Allies program “could be turned into bioweapons.”
26211	33	“If successful, the technique could be used by malicious actors to help spread disease in nearly any crop species and devastate crops,” it reads. “The research could constitute a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention,” continues the Science article, which quotes European scientists.
26211	35	“The program could be widely perceived as an effort to develop hostile biological agents and their means of delivery,” critics noted.
26211	37	"Also according to Germany's Max Planck Institute the Insect Allies program ""could easily be misused for the development of biological weapons."""
26211	39	"In a critical review published in January 2022 in the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, the scientists noted that “the combination of a virus-induced genetic modification of field-grown plants with genetically modified insect vectors poses a greater risk than the current use of genetically modified organisms."""
26211	41	In 2019, Forbes listed Insect Allies as one of the “tech ethical issues we should all be thinking about.” “Is it a biological weapon? Will it motivate other countries to develop the technology to defend themselves? Forbes wondered.
26211	43	Zhang Jie, an expert at the Plant Protection Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), told the Global Times that the possibility of using insects as vectors of harmful bacteria and viruses to attack crops and cause a food crisis not only exists, but also has a large margin of development.
26211	45	He said the three main crops - rice, wheat and corn - all have lethal viruses, bacteria or fungi. In fact, targeted pests, such as the rice leafhopper and wheat aphids, can carry different viruses to infect crops, causing enormous damage.
26211	47	“It would be lethal to turn an insect into a biological weapon, because, until now, viruses in crops have been very difficult to control. Once an infected crop develops symptoms, it is nearly impossible to save. And the virus continues to vary, making prevention even more difficult,” Zhang said.
26211	49	Zhou Huanbin, a colleague of Zhang who studies genome editing, told the Global Times that certain principles must be followed in crop gene editing, one of which is to minimize the risk of uncontrolled spread of genetically modified crops.
26211	51	"Also on the project's controllability, Gregory Kaebnick, an ethicist at the Hastings Center bioethics research institute in New York, was quoted by the AP as saying that once introduced to fields, insects and microbes ""may be impossible to to remove."" He warned that Insect Allies' technology could ""end up being destructive."""
26211	53	Violations of the Biological Weapons Convention
26211	55	"The Insect Allies plan had been labeled a ""bioweapon"" by Western scholars from the day it was announced, sparking heated discussions in Western academic circles and the media about whether the plan could violate the United Nations Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC)."
26211	57	“Because of the broad prohibition of the Biological Weapons Convention, any biological research of concern must be plausibly justified as being for peaceful purposes. The Insect Allies program could be considered a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention if the reasons presented by DARPA are implausible,” reads the Max Planck Institute article.
26211	59	A cornerstone of international biological weapons control, the BWC was ready for signature in 1972 and went into effect in 1975, with over 180 signatory states.
26211	61	The United States first pushed for the cancellation of the BWC and later became the only country to oppose the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism for compliance with the convention.
26211	63	“Using insects as vectors to spread disease is a classic biological weapon,” Silja Voeneky, a professor of international law at the University of Freiburg in Germany, told the Washington Post.
26211	65	According to Voeneky, the use of insects as a key element in this program is “particularly alarming, because insects could be cheaply and surreptitiously employed by malicious actors.”
26211	67	"His concern is echoed by Chinese military expert Song Zhongping, who called the Insect Allies technology a ""typical form of biological weapon."""
26211	69	“It could reduce crop yields in targeted countries and artificially create food crises. In this way [the affected country] would lose its independence in the food sector and could become dependent on US food exports, even for genetically modified foods, which are part of biological warfare,” Song said.
26211	71	Song believes that the United States should explain why insects should be used as vectors in this research, especially since insects could safely spread viruses in other countries' crops.
26211	73	“It's not hard to see why the United States has set up biological labs near rival nations, because only then can labs work with native species,” he said. “For example, it would be problematic if they brought American bugs to a Ukrainian lab and then released them in Russia.”
26211	75	A long history of using insect vectors
26211	77	The Insect Allies program is just one of many instances where US research has been accused of causing dire consequences around the world, especially through the use of biological laboratories.
26211	79	The United States has openly admitted that it operates 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries around the world, including 26 in Ukraine. However, the signed contracts suggest that the United States has opened laboratories in 49 countries, far more than officially recognized ones.
26211	81	The Pentagon has a long history of using insects as disease vectors. According to a partially declassified 1981 US Army report, US biological warfare scientists had conducted several experiments on insects.
26211	83	In the 1980s, the US Army's Institute of Medical Research on Infectious Diseases conducted experiments to test “whether sand flies and mosquitoes could be vectors of Rift Valley Virus, Dengue, Chikungunya and Eastern equine encephalitis.” According to Bulgarian investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, the US military had been studying their possible use as biological weapons.
26211	85	In the same decade, as part of a US military operation called May Day, Aedes Aegupti mosquitoes were dispersed in the state of Georgia using terrestrial methods. Mosquitoes are believed to be vectors of dengue, chikungunya and the Zika virus.
26211	87	Gaytandzhieva also revealed that the Pentagon would conduct entomological warfare tests in countries such as Georgia and Russia.
26211	89	In 2014, the Lugar Center, built in the United States, near Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, was equipped with an insect research facility and launched a project called “Raising Awareness about Barcoding of Sand Flies in Georgia and Caucasus. ” In the following years, two other programs had been started at the same centre.
26211	91	As a result, since 2015 Tbilisi had been infested with 'biting' flies that had developed behavior atypical of local species, such as being able to survive all year round indoors and being highly resistant to cold.
26211	93	Biting flies have also been found in the neighboring Dagestan region of Russia.
26211	95	Furthermore, while conducting research on deadly viruses and bacteria, the United States had been unable to ensure the safety of its biological laboratories. The Pentagon admitted in 2015 that live anthrax samples were mistakenly sent from Dugway Proving Ground, near Salt Lake City, Utah, to all 50 states and nine countries, including the United Kingdom, in 2003. , South Korea and Germany.
26212	1	The “price” Russia has to pay for using military force
26212	3	The Russian military is pushing into the Severodonetsk salient to cut off the backs of the Ukrainian forces by encircling them in a pocket. The attack, in recent days, has been manifested above all from the southern part, where the Russians are advancing north / northwest from the town of Popasna.
26212	5	Moscow, with its withdrawal from the Kharkiv area, amassed men and means in that sector to eliminate the Ukrainian resistance formed by about 10 brigades (two armored, two light armored, two mechanized and four light infantry). Air and artillery strikes, in the best fighting tradition of the Russian army, are getting the better of the defenders, whose escape routes Moscow forces are trying to cut off by blowing up bridges – as happened between Severodonetsk and Lisichansk.
26212	7	The Kremlin is therefore trying to proceed by successive steps to obtain its strategic objectives, among which that of having established territorial continuity between Crimea and the Federation was recently achieved with the definitive fall of Mariupol as the last defenders barricaded in the territory surrendered Azovstal Steel Plant.
26212	9	Moscow has shown that it is willing to use military force to achieve its political ends – something we had already seen, in a small way, in Georgia in 2008, in Crimea/Donbass in 2014 and with the intervention in Syria in 2015. Legal contexts several, it should be underlined: the one in Georgia was a brief symmetrical conflict between two state entities, in Crimea/Donbass there was the application of the Russian Hybrid Warfare, while in Syria there was a military intervention expressly requested by Damascus to eliminate the threat of the Islamic State and anti-government insurgents.
26212	11	The current war in Ukraine follows the same path as these previous ones: Moscow, when it deems it appropriate, does not hesitate to resort to hard power to achieve its security objectives, in the broadest sense of the term, also in consideration of the fact that its soft power capabilities – understood as the ability to offer an attractive alternative development/cooperation model – are lacking when compared to those of, for example, China.
26212	13	If for Georgia these objectives were to prevent Tbilisi from joining NATO and the EU, for Syria the intervention meant preventing a regime change in Damascus from putting an end to Moscow's presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, where it has a naval base ( Tartus) from the times of the Soviet Union.
26212	15	"Russia does not (any longer) hesitate to use force, we were saying, and it does so because, from its point of view, it believes that the context of the rules of international law has been shaped for the use and consumption of the United States and Western countries, which they exploit it from time to time to achieve their own goals (as during the intervention in Libya in 2011) or simply proceed outside of it. The case in point, and the one that the Kremlin's propaganda most often mentions with regard to this last point, is that of the conflict in Serbia, when the Atlantic Alliance in 1999 carried out the Allied Force operation without having obtained the formal mandate of the United Nations claiming it was a ""humanitarian intervention""."
26212	17	"Moscow, therefore, with these military actions is trying to rewrite these rules, and it is not alone in this mission: China too, and not only for the Taiwanese question, is acting in this sense, albeit with different methodologies. To achieve the objective of building its own sphere of security, but above all of influence, in Asia, Beijing is using its military force in a less violent but equally impactful way, and the case in point is given by what is happening in the Sea South China where the atolls of the Spratly and Paracelsus archipelagos occupied by the Chinese have been progressively and slowly militarized, according to a precise strategy called salami slicing (""slicing salami"") which aims to obtain small results that do not trigger the precipitation of events to put the international community faced with a fait accompli. This is why China contests the US Fonop (Freedom of Navigation Operation) in those waters (but not only) and why it considers the presence of Japanese naval units in the waters of another disputed archipelago, that of the Senkaku, to be an aggressive move."
26212	19	This international system, therefore, is no longer good for Moscow and Beijing, and the two giants have been moving - for years - to change it by offering in parallel an alternative model that is decidedly more attractive when it comes to the Chinese one. The One Belt One Road, or New Silk Road, has woven a global network of trade agreements with Beijing at its center that is challenging the US ability to act as a primary reference, and that is why Washington has run for cover by recently launching the B3W (Build Back a Better World), the developments of which, however, still have to be seen.
26212	21	In Ukraine, therefore, Moscow is not only playing its influence on its western near abroad, which moreover has shown that it is unable to control precisely because it is unable to provide an attractive model equal to the European/Atlantic one, but its desire to once again be the regulator of international law. A right undermined precisely by the Russian armed intervention and by what it brings with it: accepting Moscow's conditions, the formalization of the cession of Crimea and the Russian territorial conquests deriving from the conflict, therefore becomes impossible for the West, that if it were to give way it would firstly demonstrate the weakness of his model, and secondly the feasibility of using brute force to achieve one's goals.
26212	23	Certainly, in this sense, there is also the weight of history, albeit in a more global context: the outcome of the Munich conference of 1938 did not stop Hitler's Germany from continuing to achieve its Lebensraum, and likewise accepting the use unilateral force, today, would mean opening a Pandora's box remained closed since the end of the Second World War substantially.
26212	25	"This is why the United States, despite the recent diplomatic overtures with Russia, do not give in and speak of a ""long-term price"" that Moscow will have to pay for having resorted to military means by attacking Ukraine. Those words were said by President Joe Biden speaking on Monday 23 at a press conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after their summit. ""It is the cost of those who want to change the arrangements with the use of force,"" he added. Precisely these ""arrangements"" to which Biden refers are those rules of international law that Moscow is subverting with the current war, and they are the same ones that, again the tenant of the White House, said he wanted to defend for the Taiwanese question."
26212	27	In fact, during the same conference, the president affirmed that the United States would intervene militarily if China attempted to take Taiwan by force, a warning that also seems to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally supported by Washington and which will certainly serve to reassure Taipei, which already Since its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, it has begun to harbor doubts about the US willingness to stand by it in the event of an open conflict with the Dragon.
26212	29	"The conflict in Ukraine will change our world and not only with regard to European/Western foreign policy, which has isolated Russia by handing it over to China and further strengthening its ties, but also because it represents a challenge to the international law framework, openly questioned for the first time by the Kremlin which for this will have to pay a ""price"" represented by its economic bleeding to continue the conflict it has unleashed, through continuous military and financial support to the government in Kiev."
26213	1	The Ukrainian Army and the “Atlantist International”
26213	3	"23 Jun 2022 The Ukrainian army and the ""Atlantist International"""
26213	5	While the Western media sell us the military conflict in Ukraine as a great national war of liberation against the treacherous Russian aggressor, we constantly learn from Anglo-Saxon sources about the participation of soldiers from NATO countries in the ranks of the Ukrainian army.
26213	7	So much so that the Ukrainian military appears to be just an empty denomination, like the Ukrainian state, used to hide the real governing mechanisms. Well, as for the British. In other words, it is rather the Atlanticist international, which is fighting in the Ukraine against Russia!
26213	9	A few days ago, The Independent newspaper reported an interview with a Georgian commander, who is fighting in Ukraine on the Ukrainian side. It is true that Georgia has a vast experience in terms of internal destabilization and is totally under American control (just walk through Tbilisi to see the extent of the country's physical military occupation), which even retrained its ex-president-crook -revolutionary Saakashvilli with the post-Maidan Ukrainian government and for a time as governor of Odessa. We will not even talk about the Maidan snipers… In short, the friendship of the countries “liberated” from themselves in the post-Soviet space in full action!
26213	11	Thus, according to this Georgian commander, as many as 3,000 British soldiers took part in this great war of national liberation… in the ranks of the Ukrainian army. And in general, about 20,000 foreign servicemen are in the army of Ukraine.
26213	13	Which national army are we talking about? What fight is it?
26213	15	An American mercenary told American journalist Seth Harp that members of the British special forces of the SAS were also there:
26213	17	The Russians rightly claim that the very presence of these foreign fighters in Azot is blocking the process of talks and thus the release of civilian hostages. What is true for this factory is true for the country.
26213	19	The situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically since it came under foreign control. And currently, it is the direct involvement of NATO countries in the military conflict on Ukrainian soil that is making this conflict last. For the simple and good reason, that they have no interest in seeing the fraternal Ukrainian and Russian people coexist peacefully, that they want to use an extremist minority to sow terror inside the country and fight formally through them against Russia.
26214	1	Draghi is pending his resignation, just when Europe needs him
26214	3	With Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's premiership on the brink of collapse, the European Union may be on the verge of losing one of the last adults in the room.
26214	5	Draghi, 74, is credited with saving the euro during the financial crisis and played a crucial role in stabilizing the EU's third-largest economy as the bloc faces an energy crisis and war on its doorstep.
26214	7	But a domestic political fiefdom within his coalition government proved too tolerant of the Italian leader and on Thursday he announced he was offering to step down. His resignation was immediately rejected by the Italian president Sergio Mattarella, but the drama is not over.
26214	9	A confidence vote will be held next Wednesday to see if the government can continue. It is by no means clear that the Draghi alliance will survive.
26214	11	Italy's political turmoil will be felt across Europe at a critical time as EU leaders grapple with how to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine, rampant inflation and a resurgence of the coronavirus.
26214	13	The collapse of the Draghi government would risk triggering “the destabilization of Europe,” Forza Italia senator Antonio Saccone told the Senate, as the political drama unfolded in Rome on Thursday. “You would be doing Putin a favour,” he told Draghi critics ahead of a key vote in parliament.
26214	15	The crisis erupted after long-lasting tensions between Draghi and his coalition mates in the populist 5 Star Movement boiled over. After weeks of increasingly cantankerous talks, the 5Stars walked out and refused to back any of Draghi's signature economic plans in what the prime minister said amounted to a vote of no confidence in the coalition.
26214	17	The Prime Minister immediately went to visit Mattarella to discuss his future before resigning. If Draghi ultimately leaves office, it will usher in a period of instability and the specter of early elections in Italy.
26214	19	Still, even if Draghi's government survives, this episode may simply be the first of many power struggles as parties working in the squabbling coalition step up their demands ahead of next year's elections.
26214	21	Financial markets reacted with concern to the worsening crisis on Thursday. The euro fell against the dollar and the spread between the yields of Italian and German bonds, seen as a key indicator of risk, widened.
26214	23	While the market jitters will have a harder impact on the Italian economy, politicians and analysts warn that the damage of Draghi's departure would reverberate throughout the region.
26214	25	For more polling data from across Europe, visit POLITICO Polling Survey.
26214	27	A former president of the European Central Bank, his authority on economic matters has helped him assume a pivotal role in discussions among European leaders, said constitutional lawyer and democratic lawmaker Stefano Ceccanti.
26214	29	“German Chancellor Scholz only recently came to power and Macron won the elections in France, but he is weakened,” Ceccanti said, referring to the French and German leaders. “After that Draghi is the most important”.
26214	31	An Italian protagonist in Brussels
26214	33	If Draghi leaves, his leadership in Brussels will be lacking. Among his unfinished business, he has advocated for a reform of EU tax rules, working with French President Emmanuel Macron to form a plan that has not yet come to fruition.
26214	35	Moreover, plans to address the energy crisis, including a support package to reduce the impact of rising prices on consumers and businesses, could be more difficult to navigate without Draghi, according to Wolfango Piccoli, a policy analyst at Teneo.
26214	37	At the European level, Draghi has also pushed hard for a price cap on oil and possibly even gas, hoping to reduce rising payments to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin is still funding his invasion of Ukraine from the billions he earned selling EU fossil fuels, even as the bloc is quick to cut back on its purchases. While Draghi's price cap idea has detractors, it will feature in EU leaders' discussions in the coming months.
26214	39	"“This is the kind of initiative where Draghi could make a difference,” Piccoli said. “He would be listened to in Europe and he can speak directly with Biden. So it could be a loss for Europe."""
26214	41	Then there is the question of where Italy would leave a change of government.
26214	43	Draghi was originally enlisted in the post in early 2021 to design and implement the EU's package of loans and grants for Italy's post-pandemic economic recovery. These were related to far-reaching reforms, which Draghi's leadership was seen as vital to realizing.
26214	45	As the main beneficiary of EU funding, Italy is a key testing ground for the success of the programme: if the fund is to become permanent, it must be seen as a success there.
26214	47	For some, Draghi's tenure could also help ensure the continuity of European policy on Ukraine.
26214	49	In his inaugural speech, Draghi declared his government pro-NATO and pro-EU, and was seen as one of Europe's leaders more aggressive towards Moscow, calling on other European countries to get tougher on the oligarchs and supporting the Ukraine's attempt to become a formal EU candidate. His exit would risk weakening the Western alliance.
26214	51	For others, however, Draghi's hard line on Ukraine has mostly been talked about. Italy's contribution to military and financial support has been small compared to other states.
26214	53	Forza Italia senator Maurizio Gasparri has downplayed the impact of Draghi's potential exit, stressing his time is still limited by the end of the legislature in 2023 and noting that other countries have also held elections amid the pandemic and energy crisis .
26214	55	Maurizio Gasparri of Forza Italia, takes a selfie during the party convention in Ischia, Italy | Aelian Imperato/AFP via Getty Images
26214	57	"Draghi shouldn't be forced to stay because Italy fears the elections, he said: ""We will still vote within the next year, we cannot suspend democracy in Italy""."
26214	59	In the short term, it is uncertain whether Draghi will walk away.
26214	61	5Stars leader Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday indicated his party still wanted to support the government, although he did not back the economic package in Thursday's vote.
26214	63	But if Conte's party decides to leave the government, Draghi has said he doesn't want to lead another one without the 5Stelle. Even the right-wing League has suggested favoring the elections.
26214	65	If Draghi loses next week's confidence vote, the president could call a snap election. But if Draghi wins and is tricked into staying, many insist it will not only be in the national interest but in Europe's interest for him to stay.
26214	67	“Draghi's role in Europe,” Ceccanti said, “is the strongest reason why Draghi remains.”
26215	1	The New York Times: Draghi's resignation is a potential calamity for Europe

26215	9	"For the New York Times, the prime minister's government of national unity, which has ""restored influence and credibility"" to Italy, is falling, leaving the country on the way to a ""new season of political chaos at a critical moment in which the EU"" is trying to to remain united in the face of Russia and to revive its economy."

26215	13	The newspaper underlines how Draghi's exit would be a «stinging blow for Italy and Europe. The former ECB president who helped save the euro used his stature for a brief golden age for Italy after taking office as prime minister in 2021.
26215	15	But a more ruthless picture is condensed in the incipit of the editorial with which El Pais opens the online edition: «The Italian Parliament, a wild and self-destructive animal, carried out its last lethal operation on Wednesday and liquidated the legislature forcing the first minister, Mario Draghi, to resign. The violent event has many parents. But it was the right-wing parties, Forza Italia and the League, who dealt the coup de grace to the executive of which they were part.

26215	43	Italy's political vicissitudes are followed with apprehension and even astonishment, because Italy's instability has repercussions on the whole of the EU.

26215	49	The EU Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni called responsibility in a tweet: «The ballet of the irresponsible against Draghi can cause a perfect storm. Now is the time to love Italy: difficult months await us but we are a great country».
26215	51	"While the leader of the socialists in the EU Parliament, Iratxe García Pérez pointed the finger at the Italian populists and popular people: «There is concern about the evolution of the government crisis in Italy - she tweeted -.

26215	65	Draghi at the helm of Italy restored our country's credibility in Europe and restored leadership to Rome which began to be systematically involved in important decisions to be made, perhaps not always supported when interests between EU states were in conflict but questioned and heard.

We will once again be under special surveillance in the eyes of the Commission, the Nordics and the markets. After the summer, the discussion on the reform of the Stability Pact will begin and convincing the hawks will be more difficult.

26216	1	Sgarbi: «Draghi must leave the scene now, if he stays he will wear out and be forgotten like Monti»
26216	3	Draghi is right to leave now, if he stays he will self-destruct. “The majority remains very solid, there is trust in the government. But the resignation responds to a personal aspect, that relating to Draghi's fate. He knows that if he comes out now he stays in history ”. Vittorio Sgarbi, in a long night interview with La Verità, takes stock of the political tsunami of these hours. After Conte's assist to the premier, according to the art critic.
26216	5	Sgarbi: Draghi has to leave the scene now
26216	7	The former governor of the ECB must go all the way. “He Closes his path with a trauma. But with the prospect of what he might have done if they hadn't stopped him. If, on the other hand, he goes on for another 6-8 months, he wears out. Continuing to govern”, explains Sgarbi, “he would face perhaps insurmountable difficulties. And he would come out in March, or next May, like Mario Monti, who has been completely forgotten ”.
26216	9	The executive was born as an electoral government
26216	11	"Sgarbi dismantles the narration of superMario, titan, savior of the country. This government - observes Sgarbi critic - was born as an electoral executive: I keep everyone together, to be elected President of the Republic. Then it went differently. The art critic doesn't like this executive, it's no mystery. Only save Dragons ""as a person"". Just look at the figures to understand that the aggressive treatment of the government does not work. “It went from 75 to 50% approval. Which are declining more and more ”."
26216	13	"Among Mario's unforgivable mistakes, having left Speranza to the Ministry of Health. And the coronation of Di Maio at Foreign Affairs. Who is now the true guardian of the grillina orthodoxy for Sgarbi. ""The 5 star is Di Maio, those who are out are Conte's balls"". Di Maio, on the other hand, is constantly on the rise. “From a Neapolitan street urchin, a useless boy, a grillino fanatic without art or part, he had a conversion on the road to Damascus: from Saul he became Paul. He felt like Saint Matthew when he was called by Jesus. He met a true leader. He went to government as foreign minister and, from that moment on, he changed his life. He has become another man ”."
26216	15	Doubts about the day of truth in Parliament
26216	17	It is difficult to say what will happen on Wednesday, what will prevail in the choice of Draghi, the turtle. Personal ambitions or those of political expediency? “If he thinks he has to save the country, maybe he stays. If he thinks about saving his ass, he leaves the others in the shit, taking advantage of Conte's stupidity. Conte unknowingly offered him an assist, because he is an idiot ”. In the end, Sgarbi predicts, “he will allow himself to be psychologically blackmailed by foreign secretariats, by pressure from Ursula von der Leyen, Joe Biden, the Vatican, Sergio Mattarella. Only pride counts here: if I go out now, I stay Draghi; if I leave in six months, I become like Monti, forgotten and ignored”.
26217	1	Government. Chaos because Mattarella, Draghi, Conte, Salvini, Letta must win
26217	3	A thousand mayors write to Draghi to stay in his post. The markets are shaking. Newspapers aligned with power (primarily the Corriere-Repubblica-Stampa triad) tear their clothes. Brussels is in a panic. The blackmail message is that without Super-Mario there will be an apocalypse. The Recovery money won't arrive, Italy will collapse, the spread will skyrocket, inflation will gallop, Putin will win the war, the public debt will be devastating and we will no longer have the energy to live on.
26217	5	But we can calmly say to these priests of the mainstream that the money from the Recovery is already not arriving, the spread is already skyrocketing, inflation is already galloping, Putin is winning the war, the public debt is devastating and next autumn will be without energy , thanks to the sanctions, with the complicity of an Italy that has had to play the part of the first class, from the vaccination campaign to pro-US Atlanticism, the old-fashioned way.
26217	7	And all this thanks to the government of the best.
26217	9	On Wednesday, when Draghi reports to parliament, we will know what death he will die, or if he will rise again as the Phoenix Arab. At the moment the signals are for his exit from the scene. But there will be surprises.
26217	11	The problem is that, starting with him, up to the parties that support him, they collectively have the same need: to win in order not to lose face.
26217	13	Draghi must win: it has been seen that as a banker he is not very familiar with vision and democracy. In fact, since he took office he has commissioned it, systematically bypassing parliament, with every important and strategic choice. He conceives of the representation as a corporate board of directors. The mere fact that Conte questioned it is inconceivable for him. Also because, he risks compromising his designs: Quirinale, IMF, World Bank, UN or NATO.
26217	15	Ergo, he has two options: either he resigns in indignation, so as not to be blackmailed by the parties now in the electoral campaign, to avoid the blackmail of the grillini who now feel they are once again protagonists, the blackmail of Salvini who, without the Movement, would enjoy the effects of a government shifted to the right; or he emphatically reformulates an appeal for responsibility, accompanied by blames aimed at Italians and the political class, to rebuild a new noteworthy majority.
26217	17	The head of state, too, must win: he personally orchestrated the advent of Draghi and does not want to dissolve the Chambers. The word stability sees it as permanent continuity. A mantra.
26217	19	Conte is no less. If the prime minister resigns, he has taken his revenge. If he does not resign, the communication that the Movement is back alive and protagonist can be at stake, making it believe that Draghi has understood the lesson, having accepted the programmatic points wanted by the 5Stelle. And above all it will have prevented a further internal war between the supporters of leaving Palazzo Chigi and the armchair supporters, who do not want to leave (with Di Maio waiting for them at the same time).
26217	21	Salvini must emerge well from history. If Draghi falls he will say that he has achieved some things so far (for example, the postponement of cannabis and ius scholae), if he doesn't fall, he will recover the snitch inside the majority, given the clash that will in fact continue in the future between Conte and Draghi . An excellent viaticum for his electoral campaign.
26217	23	The Democratic Party rejoices, it has no problems: both in one case and in the other it will make the figure of a serious, credible, institutional party, one with governance in an extremely delicate historical moment.
26217	25	Meloni will still earn percentage points, to at least be clear in a world of double agents. A position, hers, from a solitary, coherent opposition: the vote, the word to the Italians.
26217	27	On Wednesday we will see if the desire to win or lose well will prevail.
26218	1	Draghi bis and Di Maio ds, we are at fantasy football applied to Italian politics
26218	3	Rome, July 18 - Sudden changes of shirt, new alliances, internal divisions, oaths of loyalty, fiery declarations. Draghi day is less than 48 hours away, ergo to the possible Draghi bis, or the day in which the outgoing premier will kindly let us know if he will remain in his place or confirm that he wants to leave, in the meantime, however, the classic political theater is underway Italian. A script worthy of the worst South American telenovelas, with Serie C actors taken from black and white photo novels. At least however, the television serial genres of Latin America are appreciated by housewives, in this case there is not an Italian who is happy to put up with this embarrassing pantomime.
26218	5	For the Draghi bis here is the parliamentary fantasy football
26218	7	Because we are in parliamentary fantasy football, in the acquisition campaign between political forces intent on chasing away the specter of real competition, in order to save their seat for a few more months. And then we proceed to the sound of courtship, aimed at embarking some unlikely subject who will serve as a crutch for the Draghi bis. All with the precise aim of definitively annihilating what remains of the derelict Five Stars and then getting by in the saddle of a colorless coalition. Draghi commands color.
26218	9	In itself, the sad end of the pentastellata would also be good news, just a pity that the majority competitors have also lost any badge of credibility. They all supported his majesty Draghi, praising and incensing him up to the threshold of the electoral campaign. Now, gripped by the Hamlet-like doubt about what to do (keep the seat or leave in fifth place with the pre-vote propaganda), they compete to see who snatches the most stickers from the other. Remedying cyclopean fools.
26218	11	No force that makes up the current executive is immaculate, none can be said to be truly coherent, none is seriously appreciated by Italian citizens. They all live off income in the absence of rivals up to the situation, going so far as to re-evaluate even the most targeted ex-adversary. Look at them, they are all there to roll out red carpets for Giggino Di Maio, until a few weeks ago declassified as an inadequate drinker and today elevated to a statesman of absolute prominence. From brocco to champion, the time for a lightning-fast break and a shopping campaign at the grillina house.
26218	13	"And so anything could happen, although Draghi's permanence is increasingly probable in the absence of an alternative commissioner sufficiently ""esteemed"" by the international elite. And they tell us that returning to the polls is impossible because of the Pnrr, the markets, finance, the EU, aliens and goblins. But yes, bring out the ghost Formaggino, to be deployed as a center forward in a nice political fantasy 3-4-3."
2622	1	COVID IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
2622	3	Covid was just the beginning. Climate change could bring out as many as 15,000 new viruses by 2070. This is the scenario published in the journal Nature, the result of research coordinated by biologist Colin Carlson of the American Georgetown University.
2622	5	"From bats to many other mammal species to birds. There are many species known to be carriers of viruses and which, under the pressure of climate change, could push themselves to occupy areas other than those in which they usually live. This could lead to the fact that the viruses of these animals can thus come into contact with us through what is called the ""jump of species"". This is the virus that mutates until it can attack a new species, in a domino effect that could reach humans. What would have happened for Covid to be clear."
2622	7	Climate change and rising temperatures are to blame. At just two degrees below current temperature, as many as 15,000 new viruses could emerge by 2070. There are currently 10,000 of them in circulation. Therefore, the link between climate change and the appearance of viruses that could carry never-before-seen diseases is much closer than imagined.
2622	9	Climate, the study authors note, has the potential to become a driving force in viral transmission between different species. This could increase the risk of transmission of infectious diseases to humans, in a vision in line with the so-called One Health, the approach that links animal health with human health and the environment.
2622	11	In addition to diseases contagious to humans, future viruses could pose a threat to animal health. They could cause harmful epidemics for farms. The starting point of the research was the analysis of how the geographical areas currently populated by 3,870 mammal species could change in relation to different scenarios between now and 2070.
2622	13	By applying a model of virus-to-species transmission to a subset of 3,139 animals, the researchers predicted future opportunities for virus-to-species exchange. Occasions of such biological mixes are possible everywhere in the world, but are particularly concentrated in areas heavily populated by humans, such as tropical Africa and Southeast Asia.
2622	15	"Once again, the authors of the research point out, the ""protagonists"" of these contaminations could be bats, which constitute the natural reservoir of viruses potentially capable of becoming transmissible to humans. Preventing the spread of new viruses already requires widespread surveillance of the areas in which different species could coexist."
2622	17	For the authors of the research it is important to push right now to understand how important it is to combine virological surveillance with the assessment of changes in the new areas occupied by the species due to climate change. This, they point out, is especially true in tropical regions, where most of the infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans currently originate.
26220	1	Draghi remains, the farce of the mayors' appeal. At 9.30 discussion in the Senate
26220	3	"Rome, 20 July – “Draghi remains” is the most widespread slogan of the last few days. The outgoing Prime Minister, yes but maybe not, outgoing but rejected, out of the game but also a little inside, is the strange ""martyr"" of this curious - not to mention comical - government crisis."
26220	5	"The tearjerker ""Draghi remains"" of the mayors"
26220	7	"According to the latest findings monitored yesterday evening, signature by signature, and published in Ansa, the mayors who scream in despair “Draghi stay” as if there were talk of a sort of divinity, are approaching the number of 2 thousand: 1,861 to be precise. Mario Draghi must remain ""for stability"" (what is not well understood, since to date the weight of Italian politics is non-existent and in any case there are now a handful of months away from the elections). This is how ""the desperate appeal"" to the apostle reads: ""We Mayors, called every day to the difficult management and resolution of the problems that afflict our citizens, ask Mario Draghi to go ahead and explain to Parliament the good reasons that impose to continue government action. In the same way, we strongly ask all the political forces present in Parliament that have given rise to the majority of this last year and a half to think of the common good and to put the country's interest before its own internal problems"". “Now more than ever we need stability.”"
26220	9	At 9.30 the discussion in the Senate begins
26220	11	"Draghi stays, but maybe he can talk. He still talks. And so in the Senate there will be the infamous ""day of truth"" (as it has been defined by many). The Senate itself will open its proceedings at 9.30. The prime minister will do his bidding and listen to the answers of the senators. In short, the usual protocol. Some call it “trust in the dark”. To us it still seems quite ridiculous. But as they say, the morning has gold in its mouth. Even if in this case the expression can only have an ironic meaning."
26221	1	Draghi's rudeness to the center-right: he sees Letta and then goes to Mattarella. Bewilderment of Lega and Forza Italia
26221	3	About an hour face to face at Palazzo Chigi the one Enrico Letta had in the morning with Mario Draghi. A meeting, specify sources from Palazzo Chigi, which took place at the request of the dem secretary. But an informal meeting that greatly irritated the other government partners, Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini. In turn, they met in Rome at Villa Grande with Maurizio Lupi (Noi con l'Italia) and Lorenzo Cesa (Udc).
26221	5	The bewilderment of Lega and Forza Italia
26221	7	"The center-right government expressed ""bewilderment because President Mario Draghi received the secretary of the Democratic Party and not the leaders of the other majority parties, after, moreover, a political verification had been requested"". A political snub that in fact accredits the Democratic Party as the sole interlocutor of the government in crisis. Especially since immediately after Draghi went up to Colle by Sergio Mattarella."
26221	9	The Pd: we work for the Draghi bis
26221	11	"Nothing has been leaked officially about the content of the meeting, with the Nazarene who was the first to lower silence because ""it is not the time for the boomos"". It is difficult, however, that the secretary of the Democratic Party has not reiterated to the premier the line that the dem are taking on the crisis: “We have been working for 5 days now with the same intention, to ensure that this government can go on. We are working for this and we will continue in the next few hours as well ”, as the president of the senators of the Democratic Party Simona Malpezzi said in Agorà just as Letta was seeing Draghi."
26221	13	The irony of Giorgia Meloni
26221	15	"In the center-right, discontent is skyrocketing: the prime minister cannot manage such a complex crisis - internal sources report - ""confronting himself only with the wide field of Pd and 5Stelle, even more so after a crisis caused by Giuseppe Conte's snatch and the provocations of the Democratic Party""."
26221	17	"Giorgia Meloni makes fun of the left's fear of going to vote and posts the screenshot of the Tg La7 poll which shows how if the FdI voted today it would take the lead with 23.8% of the votes. And, again, the leader of FdI comments: “To hear the press it seems that all of Italy really is begging Draghi to stay, as if this government was really in the hearts of all Italians. But then again, the same press warns that if we went to vote, those in opposition to Draghi and his government would win hands down. The typical cognitive dissonances of the left""."
26222	1	Di Maio: Conte will not vote for trust in Draghi, he bet on the elections but a collapse awaits him
26222	3	“We are in a surreal situation, we had to deal with the country's real problems, thinking of families and businesses, but instead we are in the midst of a government crisis. The majority of citizens know who is responsible for this crisis, he has a name and surname: it is Giuseppe Conte. The indictment of Luigi Di Maio who brought together the parliamentary groups of Together for the future is all against Conte.
26222	5	"“Let's be honest – insists Di Maio – Conte's party has already decided not to vote for confidence in the Draghi government. Conte is betting on early voting, but it would be a further collapse in the polls""."
26222	7	Then he defended Draghi who, from his point of view, would have made too many concessions to the 5Stelle: “Draghi has given guarantees. A superbonus table has been opened at the Mef; minimum wage guarantees were given by starting a process with the social partners; there were also guarantees on the tax wedge. I therefore believe that Conte's party is only looking for excuses by waving flags ”.
26222	9	“I'm sorry – he added – for the witch hunt within Conte's party against our former colleagues. We know what it feels like, they have already done it with us too. We encourage them to go all the way, to be on the right side of history, on the side of the country. Conte's party is becoming the pickaxe of the Draghi government ”.
26222	11	"“Since Draghi's resignation to today – he concluded – two sensational political events have taken place. 1. The demonstrations and certificates of support for the Draghi government so that it can remain in office: over 1600 mayors, civil society, entrepreneurs, the financial and international communities. 2. The executive of the Chamber of the M5S group, today Conte's party, has expressed its willingness to vote for trust in the Draghi government, beyond the will of the leaders""."
26222	13	"In fact, today's newspapers have written abundantly about this tug of war between Conte and the group leader in the Chamber Davide Crippa who is given out by the 5Stelle towards the Democratic Party. “It is not known how many – writes Il Giornale – but it is practically certain that there will be M5 MPs who will vote on Mario Draghi on Wednesday, first in the Senate and then in the Chamber. The abacus of the Palace sets the bar for thirty elected officials, almost all in Montecitorio, who are already ready to animate a new split within the Movement. In the evening the exchange says twenty deputies and two senators who will vote for confidence. A rift that has sharpened during the various river assemblies that are taking place in recent days. At the center of the governors' games is the group leader Davide Crippa, the protagonist of a series of clashes with cold weapons both during the various sessions of the National Council and in the assembly. The goal could be to be able to form a parliamentary group in Montecitorio, where the quota of twenty members must be exceeded, while in the Senate there will be much fewer defections ""."

26223	3	SuperMario is not Superman. The Fitch agency: «Uncertain phase for Italy even if Draghi remains»
26223	5	"Surprise: not even Mario Draghi walks on water. The scoop, as one might believe, is not from the Century of Italy, but much more authoritative than the Fitch rating agency. ""Mario Draghi's resignation as Prime Minister following a split in his government of national unity - reads a note - heralds greater political uncertainty even if early elections are avoided"". The thesis, hitherto based on a somewhat sibylline prose, finds explanation a few lines further on: «Whatever happens, Italy is destined to enter a politically uncertain period after almost 18 months of relative stability and the implementation of some reforms ». Anything, got it?"
26223	7	"Fitch: ""Parties will seek visibility"""
26223	9	"Including the launch of a Draghi-bis or the continuation of the current government. Confirming, in fact, that the ""salvation"" of Italy - at least for Fitch - does not pass through Draghi's stay at Palazzo Chigi. In this case, in fact, the note continues, ""we expect that the parties that support him will seek greater visibility as the elections approach, amplifying existing tensions"". Translated into simple terms, it means that not even Draghi would escape the law that wants the parties to launch an assault on the stagecoach once the bell on the last round before the polls rang. Thus, leaders and parties aiming to avoid the polls in the name of financial stability are lying knowing they are lying."

26223	15	"Draghi or not Draghi, in fact, that the government should untie the purse strings in electoral times is a law as old as it is observed. It is that of SuperMario, who is obviously not Superman, is certainly no exception. It is no coincidence that for 2022 Fitch expects a greater deficit than that estimated by the government: (5.9 percent against 5.6). The cause? Energy cost subsidies and higher interest spending on inflation-linked securities. Same music in 2023: at 4.5 percent estimated by the agency compared to 3.9 set by the government. In Fitch's opinion, even ""structural reforms and fiscal consolidation"" risk becoming ""more demanding"" objectives. In short, miracles cannot even be achieved by Draghi. Let's just hope it's not known around."

26225	3	"ELMAU (GERMANY) (ITALPRESS) – ""Putin must not win. We remain united in support of Ukraine"". Thus Prime Minister Mario Draghi, according to what is learned, during the G7 working session dedicated to the war in Ukraine. ""We are united with Ukraine, because if Ukraine loses, all democracies lose. If Ukraine loses, it will be more difficult to argue that democracy is an effective model of government"", underlined the Prime Minister. ""The decision to give Ukraine candidate status for the EU is important for Ukraine but also for the European Union – added Draghi -. The European Union has profoundly changed its attitude towards countries neighbors, its long-term strategy. It is a very important change. The Italians have welcomed the Ukrainians, their children. The government has done its part, but the most important part has been done by the local authorities, the families "". ""We must continue to work on how to impose a ceiling on the price of gas"", the premier then highlighted."

26228	1	Cutting positions in Ukraine and security in Europe
26228	3	03 Jun 2022 Cutting positions in Ukraine and security in Europe
26228	5	"The agreements between Ukraine and Poland could lead to a ""soft annexation"" of the country's western territories in Warsaw. Poland is visibly – and predictably – trying to take advantage of the situation in Ukraine by attempting to increase its political, economic and cultural influence in western Ukraine."
26228	7	The soft annexation is already well advanced, meaning that Polish citizens will be able to run in Ukrainian elections and even run for positions of constitutional judges.
26228	9	This means that Kiev is completely transferring control of the failed Ukrainian state to Poland. Warsaw won't even need to send troops or fire a single shot, at least not against Western Ukrainians.
26228	11	However, Poland is a member of NATO, a member in the most Cold War sense of the word, i.e. the potential enemy, there is only one, Russia, or rather, the former USSR. If, for its part, Russia accepts that the eastern republics of Ukraine join the Russian Federation, and this too is well advanced – the referendum for the annexation of the Republic of Lugansk has already been announced, in Kherson, on the ruble has already pushed out of the hryvnia, the Ukrainian currency, in Zaporozhye military bases will be transferred to Russia – this means direct contact between NATO and Russia, a common border without a buffer state.
26228	13	To correctly measure what this can mean for security in Europe, we must remember that this direct contact between two powers is what happened in 1939 with the dismemberment of Poland between the Reich and the USSR. , this direct contact was wanted and sought after by both sides to allow an attack on the other.
26228	15	The Reich sunk first and sunk in the USSR, not because it was superior – it was attacking 30,000 Russian tanks with 4,000 panzers – but because this, the USSR, was itself – also in attack position and not in defense position. If the USSR had launched its attack first, the annihilation of German forces within days was strictly inevitable and Germany lacked the strategic depth, general winter and natural resources of the USSR to regain a health.
26228	17	It's amusing to re-read Hitler's declaration of war on the USSR, it talks about a pre-emptive war, but as it won't take long to admit, he himself was amazed at how right he was, at which point he did. I don't think so right to say it: he was simply petrified to see, as soon as he crossed the Russian border, the extent of the accumulated Russian military power, in quantity and quality.
26228	19	It seems, moreover, that the Russians had the same unpleasant surprise in Ukraine, they too spoke at the beginning of a preventive war, not expecting to meet such a buildup of forces. But unlike in June 1941, the Ukrainian forces were massed – not in an offensive position – but in a hostile defensive position: not so much that it didn't look like aggression, but enough to force the enemy to come and stand on their tusks.
26228	21	We recognize here the typical Anglo-Saxon way of fighting with a four-stage campaign:
26228	23	It always begins with a Provoked Aggression, followed by a Siege, a very corrosive defensive phase for the opponent, then comes the Reply, precisely, the Anglo-Saxon aggression planned from the beginning and without which the defense would have had no meaning and, finally, we arrive at Victory.
26228	25	If NATO decides to carve up Ukraine, this means that after the phase of provoked aggression and siege in Donbass (phases I and II of the plan), it is not able to immediately launch a response, much less a victorious response, pause temporary in hostilities would therefore be considered on a new front: the Dnieper.
26228	27	We do not see what interest Russia would have in entering such a scenario, rather it must push its current technological advantage to inflict a defeat in good and due form on NATO by going to the western border of Ukraine: it must break through the aura of hegemonic invincibility of NATO.
26228	29	It is likely that security in Europe will wait for some time.

26229	1	inflation only benefits the state! - thanks to the rise in prices, the Treasury toasts
26229	3	Inflation weighs on Italian households and businesses, but makes the tax authorities smile. An analysis by Unimpres says this, according to which the surge in prices has ensured more than 10 billion euros of additional revenue to the state coffers in the first five months of 2022, with an increase of 19.8%. From January to May, revenue relating to VAT, which has reached 8% and is traveling towards 10%, reached 61.6 billion, an increase of 10.2 compared to the first five months of 2021.
26229	5	The increase in Irpef revenue was much more contained, which underwent a positive variation of 2.3%, with an increase of almost 2 billion to 81.5 billion. According to Unimpresa, the total tax collection in the first five months of 2022 rose by 18.5 billion (to 188.6 billion): more than half of the additional tax revenue is therefore attributable to the increase in VAT-related revenue: + 10.2 billion.
26229	7	This is due to the dizzying increase in prices, as a result of which the value added tax proceeds rose from 51.4 billion to 61.6 billion. More in detail, of the additional 10.2 billion in VAT, 6.9 billion are for internal consumption and trade (+15.1%) while 3.3 billion are due to the higher tax on imports (+59.9%).
26229	9	The State earns more also thanks to the increase in energy products, and in particular gas, with prices rapidly rising due to the war between Russia and Ukraine: tax revenues on methane grew by 453 million (+35.7% ) to 1.7 billion. The entire energy sector, in general, experienced an increase in prices: the excise duty on energy products increased by 130 million (+1.7%), the excise duty and the tax on non-condensable gases increased by 20 million (+9.5%), and the excise duty on electricity and the related surtaxes increased by 220 million (+20.9%). -

26234	5	Like a ghost, in Perugia, three years after the Palamara-gate, the little hand has reappeared which steals secret cards from the Umbrian prosecutor's office and always delivers them to the same newspapers to have the former president of the ANM bombed, but not alone. In 2019 in some newspapers, Corriere della Sera and Repubblica in the lead, juicy interceptions appeared at that moment traveling from Perugia to the CSM.
26234	7	luca palamara photo of bacchus
26234	9	No one discovered (or wanted to discover) the author. But with this latest photocopied leak, perhaps the villain, like any serial criminal, may have left a decisive mark on the crime scene. In this case he put the filing request into circulation for the facts connected to the Hungary lodge and described to the prosecutors by the fixer Piero Amara. In those 167 pages, events still covered by secrecy were mentioned.
26234	11	Including some testimonial statements not yet challenged to Luca Palamara and ready to be filed in the corruption trial already underway in Perugia.
26234	13	"The prosecutor Raffaele Cantone has announced an all-out war on what he has already branded bluntly as ""a traitor"", as well as guilty of ""filth""."
26234	15	"For the toga it is a ""story of unheard-of gravity"" which can be compared to the disclosure of Amara's minutes. The request for dismissal, as specified in a press release released yesterday, had not yet been sent to the Milan Attorney General's Office, or to that of the Cassation, or to the judicial police. Even the Gico of the Guardia di Finanza, who had requested a copy of the provision, would have remained empty-handed. ""In your interest, you will have it when everyone has it,"" it would have been explained to the military. ""It's a very serious fact,"" the prosecutor said with the agencies. ""We'll do everything we can to ascertain where it came from."""
26234	17	raffaele cantone president of the court
26234	19	As other investigations into revelations of secrecy show, in these cases will is power.
26234	21	On Saturday morning, after reading an article in Il Fatto Quotidiano which contained various quotation marks from the request, Cantone immediately had a model 45 file opened (with no hypotheses of crime, nor suspects) which, however, starting this morning became a model 44 by disclosure of secret.
26234	23	Also because yesterday two photocopied articles were published in Corriere della Sera and Repubblica which concerned the new allegations of corruption and instigation against Palamara which made Cantone imagine that someone had gone to pick that very chapter in the 167 pages of the request and then handed over to the reporters. In short, a hitman with a precise objective, the same as those who hit in 2019.
26234	25	The prosecutor is waiting for the next publications in the newspapers and some misstep of the mole. The investigators rule out that the request may have come from the examining magistrate's office, but note that the substantial four- or five-day document was photocopied in the chancery offices and passed from one room to another. For this reason, the prosecutors are trying to understand if, during these operations, the cards could have been leaked clandestinely and perhaps end up in the hands of some investigators and then in the computers of journalists.
26234	27	ADVERTISING SAIL BY LUCA PALAMARA IN ROME
26234	29	With some close collaborators, Cantone has categorically excluded the possible involvement in the leak of the deputy prosecutors who work alongside him, Gemma Miliani and Mario Formisano. The Neapolitan magistrate is ready to put his hand on the fire on the loyalty of his two dioscuri, whom he claims to trust almost more than himself. “If it were them, the disappointment would be enormous, the biggest in my life. A true act of betrayal », he commented in the tone of someone who believes he is dealing with a hypothesis of unreality. So?
26234	31	At this moment the main suspects seem to be the operators of the judicial police who have constant relations with the chancelleries and it is at that level that the investigators are looking for the flaw.

26234	35	Yesterday Palamara presented a complaint to Florence, competent for the crimes of the magistrates of Perugia, for the leak of news concerning him. These are the (umpteenth) statements that Amara made against the former prosecutor, in this case in the context of a proceeding for instigation to corruption.
26234	37	The Syracusan lawyer reported that, in 2015, while he was on board a plane with Palamara, he would have received from the latter, at the time he was a councilor of the CSM, an alleged request for 30,000 euros, to fix a disciplinary proceeding concerning the former prosecutor Antonio Musco. An accusation that also in this case Palamara considers without any confirmation and easily contestable, papers in hand. The same ones he's setting aside with the lawyers.
26234	39	luca palamara marcello melandri photo of bacchus
26234	41	"“Unfortunately Palamara is absolutely right. He did very well to report », he commented with his Cantone collaborators. For once, the former president of the ANM and his great accuser found themselves on the same side of the field. Like in the days when they played in the national magistrates. In fact, the public prosecutors believe that this leak damages the investigations ""in a very significant way"", also because ""the Palamara affair is only a piece of the request for dismissal"". But evidently someone is only interested in that."

26237	1	Rome, total disgust: immigrants occupy the tomb of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus
26237	3	Rome, July 11 - In the capital, the scenes of ordinary madness and degradation never end, especially if they concern the metropolitan jungle populated by immigrants. In collaboration with the Superintendence of Rome, the carabinieri evicted a group of Somali immigrants who had occupied the tomb of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus, near Piazza Fiume.
26237	5	The sepulchre
26237	7	That of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus is the oldest sepulcher of the Sullan period. A structure composed of a rectangular cell, built in large blocks of peperino stone, with limestone frames and pilasters and slate sub-bases. On the right of the sepulcher is the second monument made up of a travertine plinth and a marble cippus. Inside the aedicule a boy in a robe is represented in high relief holding a scroll in his hand on which a poem is engraved.
26237	9	Quintus Sulpicius Maximus
26237	11	As recalled by two long inscriptions in Latin and Greek, the tomb was built by Quinto Euganeo and Licinia Ianuaria in memory of their son who died at the age of just 11. Quintus Sulpicius Maximus was a child prodigy who, in 94 AD, had participated in the third Capitoline competition, an impromptu Greek poetry competition. Standing out brilliantly among fifty-two poets, the boy poet thrilled the audience of the city with his compositions.
26237	13	The illegal bivouac
26237	15	When the agents arrived at the tomb of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus, they found six Somali immigrants, one of whom was illegal on Italian territory, bivouacking in the ancient monument. Having climbed over the fence, the six foreigners therefore took advantage of the beds offered by the tomb of the boy poet to settle in an illegal encampment.
26237	17	I clear it out
26237	19	The removal of the tomb of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus took place by means of the police and, subsequently, the archaeological site was cleaned of garbage and excrement to be restored to safety. The six immigrants were reported on charges of invasion of land or buildings and will probably get away with nothing. The immigrant without a regular residence permit was accompanied to the immigration office for various formalities. Although the provincial command of the Carabinieri deals with countering the multitude of situations of degradation, illegal activity poured into the historic areas of the capital, the situation shows no signs of improving.
26237	21	The immigration decadence
26237	23	However, the occupation of the tomb of Quintus Sulpicius Maximus is only the latest in a long series of shameful facts. From the sepulchres of antiquity to the war memorials of the First World War, and beyond, national historical monuments too often become makeshift beds for unfortunate people who wander around in Italian cities. Thousands of immigrants ferried to Italy and abandoned to a life of misery or delinquency, degradation and violence.
26237	25	The swamp against the marble
26237	27	With the exception of those enlisted by organized crime, Italian or foreign, in the last decade very few immigrants have managed to rebuild a new life here adapted to the host society. Most of them find it easier to live by exploiting the welfare system governed by the Church, cooperatives and associations linked to the universe of the immigrationist left. Our funds, taxes and savings placed in the hands of those, Italian or foreign, who have no respect for our monuments which, indeed, should represent the very bones of a nation and its backbone.
26238	1	With Israel, Russian patience has reached its limits
26238	3	Jul 11, 2022 With Israel, Russian patience has reached its limits
26238	5	Faced with Israel's duplicity and double standards, Putin is losing his temper.
26238	7	Reports that the Russian government has ordered the Jewish Agency to cease operations across the country for the first time in three decades are not surprising given the growing tensions in Israeli-Russian relations.
26238	9	The move signals that President Vladimir Putin is tired and running out of patience with Israel's policy of eating off all shelves at once during the Ukraine crisis.
26238	11	"This is not a rumor, speculation, or even wishful thinking. It is the beginning of a fundamental change in Russian policy, hinted at by Immigration Minister Pnina Tamano and as reported by several Israeli newspapers, including the Jerusalem Post, according to which the decision could ""undermine the ability of Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel ."
26238	13	This crisis comes in the context of three major developments:
26238	15	First: Yair Lapid is now Prime Minister of Israel, succeeding Naftali Bennett; As Foreign Minister, Lapid condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine from day one and called on the [Israeli] government to side with the United States, join Western sanctions against Moscow and most importantly, supply arms to Ukraine, especially with the Iron Dome system, batteries and drones.
26238	17	"Second: Hundreds of Israeli military reservists and intelligence agents have ""volunteered"" to fight as mercenaries in Ukrainian militias under President Volodymyr Zelensky - who says he wants to make Ukraine a ""second Israel""."
26238	19	Third: the escalation of Israeli attacks on Syria, especially the June 20 bombing of Damascus International Airport which led to its closure for two weeks; this prompted Putin to ask his foreign ministry to present a very strong draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council in protest.
26238	21	The capture by Russian forces of Israeli mercenaries fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Donbass region may have changed that. It exposed Israel's duplicity and clandestine role in transferring or assisting in the transfer of weapons systems, drones, and military and intelligence personnel in the country.
26238	23	Much of the Israeli media relentlessly demonizes Russia and Putin, comparing him to Hitler and Nero, and accusing him – without irony – of committing war crimes that must not go unpunished.
26238	25	We cannot say how far this conflict will develop. But it wouldn't be surprising if that escalates ahead of US President Joe Biden's Middle East tour that kicks off in occupied Jerusalem on July 13.
26238	27	Israel calls for tightening the string on Iran and forming an Israeli-led Arab NATO to prepare to attack that country. Biden could ask in return that his Israeli guests take a clearer position and side with the United States and the West on Ukraine.
26238	29	Israel's policy of playing both sides by feigning neutrality is becoming untenable. By suspending Jewish Agency operations in Russia, Putin showed a red card. The worst [for Israel] may still come.
26239	1	Landings + 30%: Islamic bomb on Italian beaches
26239	3	And it's clear that it's an army of freeloaders looking for basic income and subsidies.
26239	5	This is once again confirmed by the numbers of the Viminale. Last year the landings of Afghans represented a negligible percentage, this year they have increased but nothing dramatic, from 1 January to today there are already 3,291 citizens from the Islamic country who have landed in Italy, equal to just over 11% of the total.
26239	7	On the other hand, Bengalis represent the nationality most present among the landed illegal immigrants, with at least 5,033 citizens landed, equal to 16%. Then follow Egyptians and Tunisians with respectively 4,967 and 4,308 migrants arrived. The latter largely follow the Tunisian and Libyan immigration route, while the Afghans set sail from Turkey, sent by Draghi's ally, Erdogan.
26239	9	And the invaders all have one thing in common: they are young Muslim males. An invading army that should be repulsed. With weapons. Instead of greeted by ex-military in heat.
2624	1	It is an alarm for our young people: after having dazed them with Covid, the war propaganda of the regime media has given them the coup de grace: they are ruining entire generations
2624	3	The survey on 5 thousand Italian students carried out by the Adolescence Laboratory and the Iard Institute: the economic repercussions are among the reasons for anxiety, but not the arrival of refugees.
2624	5	"The war in Ukraine scares the kids, who already had their own burden of fears related to the pandemic. Eight out of ten between the ages of 13 and 19 fear the involvement of Italy in the conflict or even the outbreak of the Third World War, but among the reasons for anxiety there are also the economic repercussions that we could have. Instead, they are not worried by the arrival in Italy of tens of thousands of refugees from war zones and have great empathy for the suffering of the Ukrainian people. The answers refer to the national survey on the lifestyles of adolescents living in Italy carried out annually by the Milanese association ""Laboratorio Adolescence"" and by the IARD research institute. The survey is normally carried out on a national sample of 3,500 students aged between 13 and 19, but this year the sample was 5,000 students."
2624	7	"Therefore, so much fear and suffering for the massacres of civilians in Bucha and in other centers around Kiev. But this is not enough to alleviate the panic about the repeatedly announced risks of a third world war, as well as the horror of the involvement of civilians in the war, the attempted occupation of one state by another state. ""The survey for this annual study closes on 30 May, but considering the number reached and, above all, the stability of the data - explains Carlo Buzzi, sociologist of the University of Trento and Scientific Director of the study - we thought we could already do some anticipations""."
2624	9	The survey started a few days after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, so it was possible to ask some questions aimed at understanding if and how much some aspects concerning the war could create alarm and concern among teenagers.
2624	11	Three out of four are afraid that Italy will enter the war, while eight out of ten young people are really afraid of a third world war. Then there are the economic worries, eight out of ten know that the family must save because the costs increase. Only 13 percent say they are very worried about the arrival of refugees, indeed the majority - one in two of the 5,000 young people interviewed - is quite impressed by the pain of the people attacked by the Russians, a pain that can be perceived by looking at the images of the bombings and the devastation that followed.
2624	13	“The concern of adolescents is very high, for all the aspects considered, with percentages generally ranging between 80 and 90%. – we read in the first pages of the research anticipated to Repubblica – The humanitarian aspects (suffering of the Ukrainian people and the involvement of civilians in the war) are – together with the fear of economic repercussions that we could have from the war – the areas in which concern is greatest .
2624	15	"It is interesting to observe - but it is linked to the emotional involvement in the suffering of the Ukrainian people - that the absolute majority does not consider even a possible very numerous arrival of refugees from war zones to be worrying. The level of concern is affected by age (increases with age) but, above all, by gender. Girls are on average more worried than boys (the only exception is the predictable flow of refugees in Italy) and even among those who say they are ""worried"" the degree of worry is higher in girls""."
2624	17	"And again: “A further aspect covered in the survey concerned the overall vision of the future (and therefore not specifically referring to war) by adolescents. The absolute majority have an overall negative view (worried or uncertain). Only 11% of girls and 18% of boys define themselves as ""optimistic"". Another burden of anxieties therefore agitates the Italian boys, who have already come out badly from the two years locked up in the house, or almost so."
26240	3	In 2021, 32% of retirees result
26240	5	have a pension of less than 1,000 euros. It emerges from the INPS annual report which states that the figure considers the gross amounts increased by the minimum supplements associated with the services, various forms of indemnity. However, 40% are those with less than 12 thousand euros per year, if we only consider the amounts of benefits gross of personal income tax
26240	7	This means that an illegal immigrant who lands collects more than 70% of pensioners. Just multiply the adults' 35 euros per day by one month. And let's not talk about minors, who can cost up to 140 euros a day.
26240	9	In short, the State allocates to an invader at least 35 euros a day in room and board, therefore almost 1,100 euros a month. While most of the Italian elderly have to eat, pay rent and bills with less than 1,000 euros a month. Racism?
26240	11	And the best way to finance Italians would be through pensions. Not only pensioners, but also their children and grandchildren: it is the only certain way by which it is certain that, in 99 percent of cases (unfortunately the Democratic Party has also polluted pensions) to Italians.
26240	13	All other ways (including citizenship income) risk ending up in too many cases for immigrants. In too many cases they end up with immigrants.
26240	15	Let's take the case of the baby bonus. In Vicenza, the Court forced INPS to grant the baby bonus to a lady from Burkina Faso who had recently arrived in Italy. In Brescia and Mantua identical sentences were handed down and according to the unions, which support the foreign women, more appeals are on the way. And where the national judges fail, the EU ones take care of it.
26240	17	"In Brescia, for example, the first instance had agreed with INPS but the appeal judges decided to turn to the EU court for a consultation. Result: ""Citizens of non-EU countries admitted to a Member State for work purposes, in accordance with Union law and national law - the European lawyers ruled - must benefit from equal treatment compared to the citizens of that State"". In short: Italy must pay."

26242	13	Donald Trump's run-up starts from the most remote corner of America, from Sarah Palin's Alaska. A political partnership born in 2015, when the former governor supported the candidacy of the New York outsider for the White House.

26242	21	"The former president, on the other hand, carelessly lets slip the key passage: ""We'll be back soon, we'll take back the wonderful White House soon."" It is a clear message to doubtful or hopeful analysts: Trump will not get out of the way and indeed shortly, he will announce his candidacy for the Republican primaries."
26242	23	"Of course, the former president is on the defensive at this stage. There are investigations by Congress and prosecutors. And above all there are the maneuvers of the republican establishment, not just the moderate ones, which are trying to cut him off. Trump needs banks, he needs figures like ""Sarah Barracuda"", ""the pit bull with lipstick""."
26242	25	"Palin finished in the lead in the first phase of the primaries and can now win the seat occupied for half a century by Republican Congressman Don Young, who died at 88 last March. In theory it would be an electoral round like many others. Palin, however, transformed his match into a dress rehearsal for the clash for national leadership: «We are facing an appointment that will change our lives. We have to choose between a narrow-minded, asphyxiating regime and freedom; between good and evil."""

Sixteen years ago, in 2008, Senator John McCain chose you as deputy in the ticket that challenged Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

26242	31	For some, he anticipated Trumpian populism, making the rigorous and prudent McCain uncomfortable. In any case, Palin could still mobilize the more traditionalist electorate today. For her there is no distinction between religion and politics. She is as much against abortion as she is in favor of the spread of weapons. Yesterday you took up the founding themes of the «Tea Party», the anti-tax, anti-statist movement born in 2009. Without forgetting, however, the strong link with the fossil energy lobby.
26242	33	"One of his campaign slogans recalls oil drills: «drill baby, drill». Trump followed suit. Of course, he dedicated the usual twenty minutes to ""stolen elections"", repeating false theories and wrong numbers. But then the former president attacked Joe Biden citing gasoline prices, the inflation rate, the global energy crisis. In the finale he settled the score with Senator Lisa Murkowski, a real power in Alaska. For Trump it is ""the worst of the worst"", given that the senator voted in favor of impeachment. The former president supports his challenger, Kelly Shabaka. But that probably won't be enough."

26244	1	EU Court of Auditors rejects the Commission's REPowerEu plan - Europe
26244	3	BRUSSELS - The one received today by the EU Court of Auditors against the REPowerEU plan presented in mid-May by the European Commission to accelerate the reduction of dependence on fossil fuels from Russia and increase the resilience of the EU energy system is a substantial rejection. According to the analysis conducted by the Court, of the 210 billion additional funding that the Commission estimates would be activated by REPowerEU, only 20 billion will be directly and actually made available by the plan.
26244	5	"The rest of the planned investments, the document reads, ""are beyond the control of the Commission and depend on the willingness of the Member States to use the remaining loans from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) or to divert funds from other EU policies , in particular those for cohesion and rural development"". As a result, the Court warns, the total amount of funding actually available may not be sufficient to cover the estimated investment needs. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned the spotlight on our dependence on imported gas, oil and coal, and the EU absolutely needed to act and respond quickly to increased energy security concerns,"" noted Ivana Maletic, the Member of the Court responsible for the opinion."
26244	7	"But the Court - he added - is of the opinion that REPowerEU, in its current form, may fail to quickly identify and implement EU strategic projects having a maximum and immediate impact on the Union's energy security and independence. A risk, the one highlighted by Meletic, fueled by a series of inconsistencies"" found by the Court in the conception of the REPowerEU plan. Inconsistencies deriving above all from the alleged synergies between the plan itself, focused on the Union as a whole, and the RRF, i.e. the instrument at the basis of the Pnrr and therefore declined on the basis of national projects.All elements which, in the Court's opinion, could severely limit the funding of cross-border projects and those with the greatest potential to contribute to the EU's energy security and independence ."
26246	1	EU, 'critics of the gas plan are natural but a common response is needed'
26246	3	"BRUSSELS, JULY 22 - ""Ursula von der Leyen illustrated not only the proposal but the reasons behind the plan. It is a plan based on facts, on the fact that there is a serious risk of interruption of gas supplies from Russia and we must be prepared.The fact that there is a debate between the member states does not surprise us, it is natural in a union of democracy such as the EU."
26246	5	"It is a process"". This was said by the spokesman of the EU Commission, Eric Mamer, when asked about the many 'no's received from the member countries to the gas emergency plan."
26246	7	"If on gas ""the worst-case scenario becomes reality this will affect everyone. We are absolutely convinced of it and it is vital that there is a common response"", added Mamer who, dwelling on the fact that the detractors of the plan accuse the fact that it was tailor-made for Germany, he underlined: ""No one should make the mistake of believing that only one state is affected by the stop to Russian gas supplies. There are many countries dependent on Russia""."
26246	9	"Italy, it is learned from diplomatic sources, has expressed strong opposition to the EU gas emergency plan, in particular with a report on three points of the package: the obligatory nature of the 15% cut, the very percentage of the reduction and the fact that the reduction is horizontal and equal for all. On these three points the opposition is shared by Italy and other member countries even if the framework of the is described as somewhat ""jagged"". In the afternoon a first meeting of the ambassadors of the 27 will be held on the plan and it is not excluded that an amended version of the Commission's package will arrive on the table."
26247	1	Covid started from Wuhan market animals: studies clear doubts
26247	3	Analysis on the beginning of the pandemic in China
26247	5	The covid 19 started from live animals sold in the market of Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. This is the conclusion reached by the authors of the studies published in 2 articles in the journal Science. The analysis coordinated by Professor Michael Worobey - director of the Department of Ecology and Biology at the University of Arizona - involved experts of different nationalities and produced texts that effectively exclude any alternative hypothesis for the origin of the pandemic. According to the authors, the passage of the virus from animals to humans occurred in two separate events, in the Huanan market - in Wuhan - at the end of 2019.
26247	7	One of the studies looked at the location of the first known cases of Covid 19, matching the information with the results of tests on swabs taken from surfaces and cages in various sections of the market. The other study focused on the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 after analyzing samples provided by patients who tested positive during the first weeks of the pandemic in China.
26247	9	The first study, led by Worobey and Kristian Andersen at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California, looked at the geographic pattern of Covid 19 cases in the first month of the outbreak, December 2019. The scientists were able to determine the location of almost all 174 Covid 19 cases identified by the World Health Organization in the month in question.
26247	11	Analyzes showed that the cases were concentrated around the Huanan market, while the subsequent infections were widespread in the city of Wuhan, inhabited by 11 million people. In particular, the researchers found that a surprising percentage of the first Covid patients with no direct link to the market - they were not workers or customers - were located in the areas adjacent to the commercial structure anyway.
26247	13	This reinforces the idea that the market was the epicenter of the epidemic, Worobey says, explaining that sellers and workers were infected first and effectively started a chain of infections.
26247	15	In a city that spans more than 5,000 square kilometers, the area most likely to host the home of someone among the world's first infected was within a perimeter of a few streets, with Huanan Market right inside it. explains Worobey.
26247	17	The scientists also looked at samples taken from market surfaces, such as floors and cages, after the facility closed. Samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with stalls selling live wild animals.
26247	19	The researchers determined that the mammals now known to be susceptible to the infection - red foxes, badgers and raccoons - were being sold live at Huanan market in the weeks before the first human cases were recorded.
26247	21	The upstream events remain unclear, but our analyzes of the available evidence suggest that the pandemic resulted from human infections originating from animals for sale at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in late November 2019, Andersen's summary. , co-lead author of both studies.
26247	23	The second study, a genetic analysis from early cases, was co-led by Jonathan Pekar and Joel Wertheim of the University of California, San Diego, and Marc Suchard of the University of California, Los Angeles.
26247	25	The researchers determined that the pandemic, which initially involved two slightly different lineages of SARS-CoV-2, likely resulted from at least two animal-borne human infections in Huanan market in November 2019 and possibly December 2019. The most likely hypothesis is that the two lineages were transferred from animals to humans in two separate episodes.

26248	7	I don't know how you didn't notice that the speech you gave is a purely Nazi text worthy of Joseph Goebbels, Hegedus wrote in his resignation letter, according to Hungarian news website hvg.hu.
26248	9	"In his speech, the prime minister said that European peoples should be free to mix with each other, but that mixing with non-Europeans has created a ""world of mixed race"". The Auschwitz International Committee for Holocaust Survivors called the speech ""stupid and dangerous,"" while Orban's spokesman said the media misrepresented it."
2625	1	China's latest warning to America
2625	3	"The authorities of the Celestial Empire began to prepare for the same scenario that the West played out in relation to Russia's foreign activities. Namely, to the ""arrest"" of accounts, the seizure of assets and other thefts, which the ""enlightened generalists"" call ""sanctions"". Unfortunately, there are valid reasons: the US is provoking China in every possible way to solve the Taiwan problem, clearly increasing the tension around the island."
2625	5	Little is known. There was information only about a certain meeting that the Central Bank of China held with lenders to protect itself from Western sanctions. That is, from the theft of assets. Both cash and securities and other property.
2625	7	"Beijing fears that ""in the event of a regional military conflict or other crisis"", the Russian scenario will repeat itself. That is, let the Chinese be robbed. The probability of this happening is extremely high. In the sense of both conflict and “sanctions”. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that this is done on purpose, with clear goals."
2625	9	“Escalation in the strait is on the rise. In this context, the meeting (the United States and Great Britain held talks to reduce the threat to Taiwan - ed) has the nature of preparatory work for upcoming events. This indicates an approaching operation, the United States and Japan have already prepared a military plan which does not provide for interventions in hostilities, but provides for the supply of weapons, information and innovative assistance. This meeting can already be characterized as a kind of further signal that a military operation is inevitable. The factors contributing to it only increase their activity. In Taiwan itself, active propaganda of hostilities is being carried out,” says sinologist and publicist Nikolai Vavilov.
2625	11	"Taiwan, by analogy with Ukraine, has been showered with weapons, and US President Joe Biden stated in no uncertain terms last fall that the US would defend the island. However, one should not regard these words as another ""stream of consciousness"" of a not very sane person. He doesn't run the country. It's worth mentioning here that Ronald Reagan himself, for the most part, spent his second term in a hospital bed, and even partially in a coma. And nothing, somehow they are ” the rules” …"
2625	13	"The words that the United States will not leave the poor and unfortunate Taiwanese in trouble are nothing more than loud statements. America doesn't give a damn about all the Chinese en masse, Taiwanese or Mainlanders - it doesn't matter. Only their interests count. The Yankees won't be fighting for the island's separatists, as soon as things start to smell like frying, the staffers will ""melt"". Another thing is that they will try to use the conflict 100% on the financial front."
2625	15	China is the second largest holder of US public debt after Japan, with a face value of more than $1.1 trillion. Therefore, we can assume that China is America's most important creditor. The Land of the Rising Sun does not count, it is completely controlled by Washington, as it is still occupied: American troops are stationed on the islands. But the Celestial Empire, on the contrary, is free to do as it pleases.
2625	17	In total, thrifty Chinese have accumulated about $ 3.2 trillion in reserves, and gold in their composition is the bare minimum. And all these funds are threatened with zeroing. Plus various tangible assets scattered across the planet. The result is a huge amount. In reality, it is China that is at stake, and not the fate of some Taiwanese residents there.
2625	19	"The Yankees in the most blatant way ""pump up"". American politicians arrive on the island, promise something to local leaders and another threat is heard from Washington. Even the Chinese are not standing idly by, large-scale military exercises are planned near the island. Five military satellites have already been launched into orbit simultaneously, and Chinese Air Force fighter jets have begun ""probing"" Taiwan's airspace. In other words, it's about to explode. Indeed, Beijing has no choice. Either defeat the separatists, or soon an island will appear off their coasts, stuffed with American missiles with nuclear warheads. Everything is going towards this."
2625	21	“Three treaties were signed between the United States and China: 1979, 1982 and 1989. Under these treaties, the United States recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. In addition, Beijing has repeatedly said that if Taiwan is declared independent, the PRC will immediately deploy troops. So it all depends on the United States and its puppets in Taipei. The provocation will not go through with it: the matter will be limited to maneuvers, and if they dare, China will land troops on the same day. In fact, as long as US congressmen are running the island, a landing can happen at any time,” says political scientist Andrey Ostrovsky.
2625	23	What does America gain? Very. First of all, China will be robbed, as they did Russia. (……..)
2625	25	"The Chinese will respond in the event of a large-scale robbery, there is no doubt. They have successfully suppressed the ""fifth column"" in their country, the government is united and the people support it. Therefore, the Yankees ""will come."" Of course, everyone wants to live and no one will start an atomic war, but the states will get it. How - one can only guess."
2625	27	"Skeptics, no doubt, could argue: Taiwan is home to TSMC, which supplies the most advanced chips to the United States, and other similar companies. That is, it makes no sense for Americans to sacrifice this. Yes, TSMC is indeed an important company. However, even Donald Trump began to campaign for ""American-style import substitution."" Production began to return to the country, including high-tech ones. Now all this is happening. This year Intel will build two huge factories in Ohio: in New Albany there will be the largest complex in the world for the production of semiconductors."
2625	29	"Other companies have similar plans, and not everything gets in the media. The United States has a strong industry, a lot of skilled people (including those ""stolen"" from all over the planet), and the process is underway. Very cheerful and in the right direction. These are not spells of Russian officials. In the United States, this same reindustrialization is now underway. Pursuant to the decree of Biden himself of January 25, 2021."
2625	31	“The United States government, consistent with applicable law, will use the terms and conditions of federal contracts in federal procurement to maximize the use of U.S.-manufactured goods, products, materials, and services,” is a quote from this document.
2625	33	"So all is well with the Yankees. They rebuild their economy and pillage the world. Russia has been robbed, China is next. Moreover, it is by no means a fact that, after a sharp escalation of international tensions, the United States will remain a ""democracy""."
2625	35	“The desire to establish a totalitarian dictatorship has manifested itself in American politics, the stronger, the weaker the possibilities of American elites have become to maintain their global hegemony by conventional means, within the framework of the existing system of international relations and international law . As soon as the crisis of the American system reached US shores and the degeneration of the resource base led to a split in the elites, the most reactionary circles of the hegemonic globalist elite (Clintonites and Bidenites) immediately tried (and did not unsuccessful, even if it is not definitive and risks ending in a gigantic failure) to establish a totalitarian neoliberal dictatorship in the United States,” argues political scientist Rostislav Ishchenko.
26250	3	"Global electricity demand growth is slowing ""drastically"" in 2022 when it is expected to grow by 2.4% after 6% the previous year, due to weakening economic growth and rising energy prices in following the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
26250	5	A similar increase, in line with those of the last 5 pre-Covid years, is expected for 2023.
26250	7	A growth higher than that of electricity demand is distinguishing renewable sources which, thanks to the new installed capacity, could see a growth in production of more than 10% in 2022 and replace part of the production of fossil fuels.
26250	9	Despite the increase in coal consumption in some European countries to replace Russian gas, the sector's carbon dioxide emissions are expected to decrease in 2022, from an all-time high reached in 2021, with a small decline of around 0.5% in 2022 and 1% in 2023. In Europe alone, emissions would rise by 3% this year and then drop by 8% next year thanks to the growth of renewables.
26250	11	As for prices, the IEA points out that in the first half of 2022, the average price of natural gas in Europe was four times higher than in the same period of 2021, while the price of coal was more than triple. The IEA price index for the world's main wholesale electricity markets reached levels double the average for the first half of the 2016-2021 period.
26252	1	"Germany, Economy Minister Habeck: ""Let's face the biggest gas crisis"""
26252	3	"Germany faces ""the biggest gas crisis"", due to the ""politically desired and created economic dependence"" on imports of this energy source from Russia. ""We will get rid of it at the speed of the wind"". This was stated by the German Minister of Economy and Climate Protection, Robert Habeck, at the end of his visit to the Bad Lauchstaedt energy park in Saxony-Anhalt today."
26252	5	"The Greens member added that it took years to make Germany dependent on Russian gas, but that ratio will be overcome ""within months and a few years"". In this regard, the German Minister of Economy and Climate Protection underlined the importance of hydrogen and the development of other renewable sources for its production. For Habeck, ""this is the future"", but first and foremost it's about getting through the next winter and the one after."
26254	1	This is how they comment on Draghi's resignation in Russia
26254	3	Draghi's resignation, sanctions … in the West, are Putin's rivals over?
26254	5	In Russia they comment on Draghi's decision to resign (which Mattarella did not accept).
26254	7	Professor of the Department of Comparative Political Sciences at RUDN University Jurij Poc'ta, in an interview with RT, commented on Prime Minister Mario Draghi's decision to resign.
26254	9	The series of resignations of European leaders is part of the crisis in Europe, believes the Russian political scientist.
26254	11	“This is an energy crisis, a political one… These are contradictions and a tendency towards rift within the European Union, intensified by Brexit. And the financial problems that arose in connection with the sanctions, the desire to harm Russia backfired throughout European society, ”the political scientist explained.
26254	13	In his view, the wave of resignations could be related to the crisis of leadership in Europe. The problems that exist today are a serious challenge for the leaders of European states: not everyone is able to deal with them, the expert concluded.
26254	15	"On June 30 at the press conference of the NATO summit in Madrid, Macron had admitted that the price of anti-Russian sanctions is really heavy, he declared: ""While the price of sanctions and the mass support we give to Ukraine is really very high, this it is the price of war that we did not want. This price must be paid for Europe to restore peace""."
26254	17	Meanwhile, the European Union plans to propose a new package of anti-Russian sanctions in the coming weeks, while the Russian government is preparing the response measures - the ban on entry into Russia for trucks from the EU could take effect from October 1 .
26254	19	Drafts of regulatory documents are being processed by the Transport Ministry, two sources from the Russian freight market told Izvestiya newspaper.
26254	21	The possibility of a ban on the entry of heavy vehicles from the European Union into Russia from October 1, 2022 was also reported by Interfax.
26254	23	I recall that in April the European Union, as part of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia, banned Russian and Belarusian trucks from entering EU territory.
26254	25	For Russia's geopolitical opponent, the leadership crisis was marked by the resignation of Boris Johnson and the assassination of Shinzo Abe. While Abe's assassination was the work of a lone fanatic and Johnson's removal was the result of discontent between his government and party associates, they have one thing in common: strong leaders have been eliminated. It may be that historically it is no coincidence, in the sense that they symbolize the end of an entire era: the time of Western domination. On February 24, the Western era was finally ended and the reaction of the G7 countries to the special operation in Ukraine only confirmed this. But the West's attempt to punish and isolate Russia has backfired like a boomerang at Western leaders themselves. Furthermore, the entire non-Western world has refused to side with the West.
26254	27	Each of the G7 countries has had its own domestic political difficulties, and the energy crisis has only added to the heated climate, but it is hard not to notice that it has not been five months and in most major Western countries the authorities already have large problems.
26254	29	Biden's credit rating has dropped to 30 percent - which virtually guarantees the defeat of the ruling Democrats in the November midterm elections. Macron won the presidential election, but lost the parliamentary election – and now his government will not be able to count on a parliamentary majority.
26254	31	The position of the governments of all the major G7 countries has become more precarious - and their struggle for Ukraine, its consequences have played a significant role.
26254	33	But for Russia only one thing is important - how does this affect their position on Ukraine? Will they continue to increase arms supplies, hoping to defeat Russia on the battlefield, or will negative domestic political trends make them more cautious?
26255	1	Saudi Arabia doubled its imports of Russian oil in the second quarter of 2022
26255	3	Saudi Arabia more than doubled the amount of Russian oil imported during the second quarter of 2022, meeting summer cooling demand and freeing up the kingdom's crude for export, according to data reported by Reuters.
26255	5	Russian oil has been available at a discount in the wake of severe economic sanctions imposed on Russia following the war in Ukraine.
26255	7	Aimed at isolating Russia and cutting its energy export earnings, the sanctions have instead created a major energy crisis across the West.
26255	9	Last month, inflation in the US hit a 40-year high as runaway fuel prices hit the nation. Other NATO members, such as Germany, fear that entire industries could be destroyed after losing access to Russian fuel.
26255	11	Meanwhile, many nations in the Global South have ramped up their imports of Russian oil and gas, taking advantage of their large availability.
26255	13	Faced with this crisis, US President Joe Biden is heading to Saudi Arabia hoping to ease tensions with Washington's historic ally.
26255	15	It should also ask Saudi officials to increase their oil supply for global markets.
26255	17	According to data obtained by Reuters, Riyadh imported 647,000 tons of fuel oil from Russia through Russian and Estonian ports between April and June this year, up from 320,000 tons in the same period last year.
26255	19	For all of 2021, Saudi Arabia imported 1.05 million tons of Russian fuel.
26255	21	Imports of Russian fuel through the UAE's West Asian oil hub of Fujairah have also increased in recent months.
26255	23	According to traders, Fujairah received 2.1 million tonnes of Russian fuel this year, surpassing 2021's 1.64 million tonnes.
26255	25	Since the start of the NATO-instigated war between Russia and Ukraine, Washington's main partners in the Gulf have ignored desperate calls from Western leaders to break with their OPEC+ commitments and ramp up oil production levels.
26255	27	Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have instead chosen to strengthen cooperation ties with Russia.
26255	29	As The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week, despite welcoming Biden to the kingdom, Saudi officials are not expected to abandon their oil-producing partnership with Russia.
26256	1	"Lavrov: ""Traces of colonialism are evident in the policies of Western countries"""
26256	3	Sadly, traces of the policy of colonialism are evident in the policies of Western countries when they demand that the whole world stands for them and against the rest [of the countries], he said today during his visit to Uganda. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
26256	5	His statements were made during the press conference after talks with his Ugandan counterpart, Sam Kutesa, and the president of the African country, Yoweri Museveni.
26256	7	In this way, Lavrov believes that the West's statements and actions highlight the thinking of the neocolonial bloc and condemns its attempts to resolve its differences with Russia through Ukraine.
26256	9	"The head of Russian diplomacy instead stressed that discussions on solving the energy and food crisis in the world ""will not depend on the state of mind"" of the Western counterparts. In this regard, he praised the government of the African country for its refusal to take sides in the Ukrainian conflict, stressing that he understood that the aforementioned crises ""have nothing to do"" with the special military operation in the European nation."
26256	11	Recently, Lavrov recalled that Western countries have exacerbated the global food crisis by imposing sanctions against Russia that have affected its agricultural exports. He also reiterated that the main reasons for the food crisis threatening the world include the coronavirus pandemic, the massive issuance of unbacked banknotes by Western countries and the unprecedented drought in Africa.
26257	1	Von Der Leyen's messages to Bourla (Pfizer) are officially classified
26257	3	Last September we talked about the initiative taken by Emily O'Reilly, the EU ombudsman (ombudsman or mediator), who undertook to investigate the issue concerning the refusal to grant access to texts relating to mobile messaging exchanges between the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Boula which allegedly took place as part of a diplomatic mission to guarantee the doses of vaccine against the coronavirus in the EU, an event widely illustrated at the time by the New York Times.
26257	5	"In fact, when a formal request for access to the messages was presented, the Commission claimed to have no record of it. Text messages, the European Commission itself had argued, are generally ""short-lived"" and in principle excluded from its registration."
26257	7	"If the text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents, O'Reilly had put on paper, issuing a determination of ""maladministration"" by the Commission."
26257	9	"Following the ombudsman's formal action, the response from the Commission arrived on 29 June bearing the signature of Vice-President Vera Jourova': ""When a document drawn up or received by the Commission does not contain important information and/or is brief, it is not within the sphere of competence of the institution, does not meet the registration criteria and is therefore not registered. These short-lived and ephemeral documents are not kept and, consequently, are not in the institution's possession, in accordance with Article 2(3) of the Regulation. Consequently, the European Commission considers that it did not treat the request in a ""narrow"" way and that it did not treat it in a limited way and that the search and processing of documents for the purposes of requests for access to documents by the public under the Regulation (EC) no. 1049/2001 is justified and follows the consolidated practice. In light of the above, the Commission can confirm that the search undertaken by the President's Cabinet for text messages relevant to the request for access to documents has yielded no results."""
26257	11	"Ultimately, the Commission is hiding behind its initial response, formally reiterating that ""due to their short-lived and ephemeral nature, text messages and instant messages in general do not contain important information relating to policies, activities and decisions of the Commission, nor are they in the possession of the institution."" ""The Commission's response is problematic on several points"", was O'Reilly's reply entrusted to a spokesman for her."
26258	1	In Germany production cuts due to energy prices. Risk of de-industrialization?
26258	3	"Without Russian gas, Germany will be in serious trouble. We have heard this prediction many times, but now the scenario for Berlin is starting to become real with its dramatic consequences. Perhaps it is no coincidence that just yesterday statements by the German Foreign Minister came out, in which Annalena Baerbock says that without Russian gas, Berlin will face ""popular riots""."
26258	5	A number of German industrial firms are cutting output in reaction to rising energy prices, according to a survey conducted by the country's Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK).
26258	7	The survey of 3,500 companies in Europe's largest economy found that 16% are reducing production or partially halting operations, Reuters reports.
26258	9	"These figures are alarming, said Peter Adrian, president of the DIHK. ""They show how permanently high energy prices are."""
26258	11	Germany depends heavily on Russian gas to fuel its export-based economy and to heat homes. But the country is preparing for a possible total blockade of Russian supplies resulting from European myopia and the US hegemonic design.
26258	13	Already down from last year, Russian gas flows have slowed further through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and Berlin has moved into the second of three phases of its contingency plan for supplies.
26258	15	"The alarm had already been raised at the beginning of this month by Yasmin Fahimi, the head of the German Federation of Trade Unions (DGB), who in an interview with Bild am Sonntag stated: ""Because of gas bottlenecks, entire industries risk permanent collapse: aluminium, glass, chemical industry. Such a collapse would have huge consequences for the entire economy and employment in Germany."""
26258	17	Berlin last month rolled out two of its three-tiered gas contingency plans after Russia cut deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, one step before the government rations fuel consumption in Russia-dependent Germany. about a third of its energy.
26258	19	Elsewhere in his remarks, Fahimi warned that rising costs for carbon emissions place additional burdens on households and businesses, adding that the crisis could also lead to social and union unrest.
26258	21	In short, disturbing scenarios are opening up for Germany.
26258	23	"For a geo-economic power like Germany, the combination of exorbitant costs to rearm and having to forcibly give up the gas supplied (at low cost) by Russia could have lethal effects. The CEO of BASF stated it in no uncertain terms: ""Without Russian gas, the economy will collapse""."
26258	25	"Interviewed by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, he contrasted the bellicose rhetoric of the USA, NATO and mainstream megaphones with the harsh reality: ""Putting the question in brutal terms, a possible stop in supplies from Moscow would drag the German economy into the worst crisis since the Second World War and it would destroy our prosperity. Especially for many small and medium-sized companies, this could be the end. We can't take such a risk!”."
26258	27	In short, Germany is seriously at risk of de-industrialization. And it is in all likelihood also the objective of Washington which, by defusing the European locomotive, would try to avert any hypothesis of Eurasian rapprochement which would considerably resize the so-called Anglosphere.
26259	1	Zelensky: We will not accept Medvedev's intimidation
26259	3	"Some Ukrainian politicians are ""trying to threaten"" the Russian Federation. This was stated by the deputy chairman of the Moscow Security Council, Dmitri Medvedev, who hypothesizes an attack on the Crimea. But if something like this happens, “the day of judgment will immediately come for all of them”"
26259	5	Zelensky: Ukraine will not accept Medvedev's intimidation.
26259	7	"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would not accept intimidation by Russian Federation Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmytro Medvedev, who threatened Ukraine with ""doomsday"" in case of an attack on Crimea."
2626	1	Putin, the independent poll debunks yet another lie: he is increasingly popular among his own and the sanctions have made a moustache of the very rich oligarchs
2626	3	"Russia is increasingly with Vladimir Putin. This is supported by the Levada Center, an independent Russian non-governmental organization recognized by the Kremlin as a ""foreign agent"". In short, we are not talking about a pro-Putin poll. Lev Gudkov of the Levada Center says that the Russian president's popularity “is on the rise for now. And more and more people support the offensive in Ukraine. The percentage of those who believe that the country is heading in the right direction has increased significantly,” he says, citing a survey by the body. After more than a month of war, which for the Russians is just a ""special military operation"", the Tsar's approval rating jumped from 71 percent in February to 83 percent in March. Not even the Bucha massacre stops support for Putin: “People won't protest what happened because they've been convinced it's not real. All the TV networks only air denials. They say it was a set-up, a fabrication,” Gudkov tells Repubblica."
26262	3	What displeases is the heterogenesis of ends. The left, when it has nothing more to say, devoid of ideas, serious programs and a ruling class worthy of note, certain perspectives, resorts to the ghost of fascism.
26262	5	And not only; in view of the imminent electoral appointments, a media, cultural and political campaign always begins, based on a violent militant anti-fascism, which no longer makes sense, given that fascism has long been dead and buried.
26262	7	However, it evidently still manages to unite citizens, indeed to scare them, to compact parties and leaders, structurally and genetically against each other armed, and to shift that little consensus that is decisive for winning. Sign of a mass psychological need that remains, even in the face of the collapse of ideologies and belongings.
26262	9	And even now, the risk that the center-right, led by the Fdi, could win on September 25 has already unleashed the same scientific demonization.
26262	11	"A well-known and tested theme: history is used, or rather, the ideology of history, as a political club against the ""enemies""; the memory of the past is erased, dissecting the world into good and bad, good and bad, and free associations are made to demonstrate how much the ""unpresentable"" are monsters."
26262	13	When around Meloni they sang victory, rejoicing over the international customs clearance by the strong powers (primarily, the American newspapers), and sometimes even by the Democratic Party, those who had a little salt in the pumpkin remembered the trap: the mainstream uses a useful symbol to strike the real enemy. It happened with Fini when it was a matter of throwing Berlusconi down from the tower. Once the goal was achieved, in fact, the Finians ended up in the pulp and into oblivion. It happened with Meloni herself in an anti-Salvini function, and now that Fdi is in pole position, fascism is in a skirt.
26262	15	We saw it before the recent administrations, we are already seeing it now 60 days before the national vote.
26262	17	If we read the headlines of the big newspapers, the articles of left-wing commentators, first of all Michele Serra, one should pale in comparison to the amount of racism that has taken the field.
26262	19	But what is sad is when a historic Fdi leader replicates the scheme.
26262	21	That is, he too uses the story to hit an enemy at home. Since the internal war between the center-right is now over the premiership, the watchword is to block the hypothesized nomination of Antonio Tajani as probable head of the coalition. The umpteenth episode of a war within the center-right, which is seeing on one side, the Salvini-Berlusconi axis intent on finding objective tools that can curb the advance of Meloni (the famous assembly of elected officials and control by number of candidates who will be chosen for the single-member quota); and on the other, Meloni who thinks of nailing her friends-enemies with an anti-mess pact to avoid new pro-Draghi-2 temptations, reiterating in the event of no agreement on who will be the head of government and 50% of the you seat the non-sense of the alliance.
26262	23	And what did Fabio Rampelli do? He rejected Tajani saying that as a young man he was a monarchist. As if this were a mark of infamy, equal to the fact of having a neo-fascist birthplace or origin (the MSI), like many Fdi parliamentarians.
26262	25	Prince Emanuele Filiberto was right to remind Rampelli of the genesis of the national Right desired by Almirante (with the Pdium monarchists), and of the National Alliance, with characters of the caliber of Professor Fisichella, a true monarchist and beyond. And to remember the 10 European monarchies that preside over the destinies of the peoples and nations that have achieved the best results in terms of national unity, progress and institutional stability. While many republics degenerate into chaos or dictatorships.
26262	27	Last observation: when Fdi talks about homeland and patriotism, it should remember that Italy was made by the House of Savoy and that the national identity is made up of the monarchical period (85 years), the republican period (76 years). Even on numbers the monarchy wins. And Rampelli's reply to the prince was correct, but still, unfortunately, with a pinch of bias from July 25th or September 8th.
26266	1	Kremlin: Iran and Russia ready to abandon the US dollar in bilateral trade
26266	3	Iran and Russia are both seeking to phase out the use of the US dollar in their bilateral trade, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced today.
26266	5	We all know that economic and trade relations between the two countries slightly exceeded $4 billion last year, although it might be wrong to count that in US dollars, and over time we will likely move away from this practice as we develop our cooperation in the banking financial sector, Peskov specified to the Iranian media.
26266	7	The Kremlin official added that net trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 31% in recent months and that the two countries have scope to cooperate to mitigate the effect of Western sanctions.
26266	9	His comments were made on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting in Tehran to hold a summit between his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in what will be a continuation of the Astana talks.
26266	11	This will mark Putin's second foreign visit since the start of the war in Ukraine on February 24.
26266	13	Earlier this month, the head of Iran's central bank, Ali Salehabadi, announced that Tehran hopes to rapidly implement the interbank cooperation agreements signed in Moscow on July 7 and 8.
26266	15	"Traders, businessmen and economists will soon see the results of these deals, Salehabadi said, adding that the memoranda of understanding (MoU) ""will strengthen the developing economic and energy ties between Iran and Russia."""
26266	17	The two countries are working to link their card payment systems, using one similar to SWIFT, the predominant form of money transfer via global banks.
26266	19	The change in card payment system is a response to major card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, which have blocked both countries due to Western sanctions.
26266	21	Iran also recently announced the first transport of goods from Russia to India via the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC).
26266	23	The newly operational maritime corridor, which is out of reach of sanctions, also has the potential to turn Iran into a major transportation hub.
26267	1	Germany may not survive next winter in a half-empty gas depot
26267	3	The 2022/2023 heating season could be incredibly difficult for German residents and industry. This was reported by the German media, fearing that Germany will survive the coming winter in the midst of half-empty gas storage facilities.
26267	5	The Spiegel newspaper writes that Germany is preparing for the inexorably approaching cold, as for military operations.
26267	7	“Germany prepares for winter as for war, as if the Russians were already at our doorstep. It is difficult to say what will happen when Putin turns off the gas tap,” the publication reads.
26267	9	"Spiegel calculated that prices in Germany have risen for everything from food in shops to petrol at petrol stations. At the same time, the director of the German Institute of Economics Michael Hüter predicts the collapse of the European gas market ""because of the selfishness of its participants""."
26267	11	In turn, the newspaper Bild conducted a survey of German citizens, during which very pessimistic moods emerged. It turned out that 47% believe that the Federal Republic of Russia will be hurt more by sanctions than Russia, only 12% believe that the Russian Federation will suffer more damage. 74% expect an economic slowdown and an increase in unemployment in Germany, while 83% believe that prices will continue to rise.
26267	13	"At the same time, Bild, as if to joke with readers, published a statement by Greek Tourism Minister Vassilis Kikilias. He suggested that people in Germany wait for the cold season on the Mediterranean coast, where ""heating is not needed""."
26267	15	Furthermore, the Federal Network Agency (regulator) of Germany predicts that from 2023 the cost of natural gas in Germany will triple. Now the ministry is urging consumers to reduce consumption of this type of fuel as much as possible to delay the shutdown of the industry and slow down the ruin of German homes.
26267	17	Even German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not stay away from what was happening. He said he was bitter about Russia's actions against Ukraine because the environmental agenda would suffer because of it. Today, Germany is forced to temporarily use some power plants that have already been decommissioned or should have been closed. Restoration of 16 idle coal- and oil-fired thermal power plants has begun and the life of 11 others has been extended.
26267	19	Scholz stressed that the decision was caused by a reduction in energy supplies from Russia. He assured that Berlin does not intend to give up its goals in the field of climate protection and that the decision on thermoelectric power plants is provisional.
26268	1	The chaos in Dover mirrors Boris Johnson's tenure
26268	3	"«How ready is the port of Dover for a no deal? At 100%"". It is a conservative propaganda card on social media, still online, dated 21 September 2019. The quotation mark is from the CEO of infrastructure Doug Bannister, at his side Boris Johnson, recently prime minister, wearing a flamboyant bib, the uniform of a triumphant campaign towards the vote. The no deal has been averted, BoJo's political parable has foundered, but the queues and delays of recent days - for which the government has tried, in vain, to blame the French - reveal yet another lie of the Tories aged badly. Another slogan deflated to the test of facts."
26268	5	"From the port ferries leave for Europe. About ten kilometers from there, still in Kent, is the British outlet of the Channel Tunnel, which connects Folkstone to Calais. Last weekend, a ""major accident"" was declared in the region."
26268	7	Kilometers of queues, thousands of tourists who have not managed to embark, others forced to sleep in their cars, stuck in columns for hours to advance a few tens of meters. The paralysis, which began on Friday, only eased on Sunday. The authorities had gone so far as to advise traveling with supplies of food and water, to arrive well in advance, to the frustration of thousands of English who wanted to go on holiday.
26268	9	"It wasn't a perfect storm. The exodus has always started from that corner of the island. The stalemate was caused by ""Operation Brock"", a protocol that is triggered when truck traffic becomes overloaded. In effect, it turns a piece of the M20 motorway into a marshalling and rest area. In this case, a 40 km stretch was closed, where more than 3,000 trucks were parked. Brexit supporters branded the scenarios evoked by the newspapers and the pro-European front as ""terrorism"", where Kent was transformed into an open-air car park. Instead here we are, as had already happened in 2020."
26268	11	Thus, motorists were diverted to minor roads, which became clogged. Some families said it took more than six hours to cover the last few miles, in that little seat of England. A return-style performance from Liguria to Milan on a Sunday with a black mark. Flows, back to pre-pandemic levels, are a partial excuse. The slowdowns depend on the checks, longer than in the past. In fact, since the country left the European Union, a border has resurfaced there. To cross it, not only must the documents be shown, but the passport is also stamped.
26268	13	Hence the extension of time. Not really unpredictable. Downing Street has accused the French counterpart of not having increased the workforce on duty on the border. An accident on the motorway contributed to disrupting traffic, but it is not enough to justify the chaos which lasted for three days.
26268	15	"""The port of Dover, which is private, prefers to blame the French police,"" said the prefect of Calais, Georges-François Leclerc. The Elysée Transport Minister, Clement Beaune, also declined all responsibility, while the deputy Pierre-Henri Dumont (of the Républicains) spoke clearly of the ""consequences of Brexit""."
26268	17	"The British government hastened to deny it. A spokesperson pledged £32.5m of investment to improve parking facilities in England, to ""help motorists better plan their journeys and layovers"". If it's a joke, they didn't get it on the other side of the Channel. Also because the amount is dangerously close to that, of 33 million, of the project proposed by France to adapt the port to post-Brexit. Dumont reiterates this in a tweet: ""A few months ago the British executive rejected a plan to double the number of passport control stations""."
26268	19	Downing Street instead would have allocated only 33 thousand pounds at the end of 2020: 0.1% of the requested amount. 13 million people and 2.5 million vehicles transporting goods pass through that hub every year.
26268	21	"The only factor of discontinuity is Brexit, but not from an ideological or political point of view. The Conservatives, who were waiting for it and celebrated it, ferried us to the United Kingdom without preparing the necessary countermeasures. It's a fact. Yet, after months of scandals, in the ""real country"" there are those who still prefer to believe in French ""revenge"" instead of admitting the unpreparedness of a ruling class, intent on renewing itself in the name of populist continuity."
26268	23	"Until an automated customs barrier is operational, last weekend's nightmare could become the ""new normal"" according to several experts. The shipbuilding bulimia was typical of Boris Johnson, who dreamed of an underwater tunnel between Ireland and Scotland and a roundabout under the Isle of Man. Engineering fantasy."
26268	25	Dover's queues are another good metaphor for his tenure now at the end of the credits: electoral lies crumbling quickly, pyrotechnics on talk shows but disorganization in government, at the expense of ordinary people. Like his nefarious deal to deport migrants to Rwanda. The African country, which received 120 million pounds from London, says it can only host 200 refugees. At the modest sum of 600,000 pounds per person.
26269	1	Why Zelensky fired two top officials of Ukraine (unknown)
26269	3	Volodymyr Zelensky's dismissal of the prosecutor general and the head of the secret service was greeted with great astonishment, first of all because it opens a rift in the Ukrainian administration. Ever since the Russian invasion began, the president has always tried to unify his government and top officials, and Iryna Venediktova and Ivan Bakanov certainly were among them.
26269	5	The unclear contours of this decision increase the bewilderment. According to Zelensky, more than 60 employees of the offices headed by the two officials collaborated with the Russian army in the occupied territories, operating against the Ukrainian state. In total, 651 high treason cases have been opened against Ukrainian officials and law enforcement officials, the president said. According to the Ukrainian constitution, the president does not have the powers to relieve the two officials from office: in fact, the final decision came thanks to a parliamentary vote.
26269	7	"Would the shadow of a coup then have motivated the choice? According to the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Yevhinnii Yenin, last month there were more than 800 people suspected of being involved in sabotage and reconnaissance activities on behalf of the Russians, many of them civilians. These people would now be detained and handed over to the security services of Ukraine. ""We have thwarted a Russian plot to target the government leadership,"" Yenin said, specifying that the police can now count on 123 counter-sabotage groups, for a total of at least 1,500 members."
26269	9	"After all, in the villages and cities of eastern Ukraine, the most pro-Russian region of the country, soldiers are always legitimately concerned about the threat posed by those who side with Russian troops, more or less hidden. ""The Kremlin has informants of all kinds, often often acting on the promise of a position in a future Russian-controlled administration,"" writes the New York Times."
26269	11	Is this perhaps why Zelensky has lost faith in the number one of the secret services, Bakanov, his friend of many years, by his side since he became a famous actor until his leap into politics in 2019? Already last June, Christopher Miller, Politico correspondent from Ukraine, wrote that Zelensky was thinking of removing Bakanov from the Security Service (SBU) - which is a huge machine, with 27,000 employees: for comparison, the British MI5 it has just 4,400 employees – because it had long since lost faith in him: the main reason would have been the immediate loss of Kherson, on the Black Sea coast, an outpost of the Russian conquests on the Ukrainian national territory and a strategic place in this war.
26269	13	It would not be a coincidence, according to this reading, that in the same hours in which Bakanov was relieved of his post - replaced by his deputy Vasyl Malyuk, at least temporarily - a friend of his, Oleg Kulinich, who until March was the deputy - intelligence officer in Crimea, the peninsula from which the column of tanks that took Kherson in a few hours left: the accusation is that he leaked confidential information to the Russian special services.
26269	15	"The now former head of the Security Service of Ukraine defended himself by saying that thanks to the work of his agency, Russian troops were unable to capture Kyjiv: ""Russia planned to take Kyjiv in three days: we built in advance a defense to neutralize them,” he himself declared via Telegram."
26269	17	But another, perhaps decisive, question also hung over Bakanov: Radio Free Europe underlines how the former official also holds a top position in a private company registered in Spain, thus violating an anti-corruption law: «Ivan Bakanov held the position of sole director at the Nueva Tierra Verde Sociedad Limitada, since 2015». Article 25 of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Law stipulates that persons holding public office are forbidden “to be members of councils, other executive or supervisory bodies and supervisory boards of commercial enterprises or profit organizations”.
26269	19	"Furthermore, the difficulties revealed by the Secret Services in this conflict are not just the loss of Kherson. ""In April, Zelensky demoted two top generals of the SBU, Andriy Naumov and Serhiy Kryvoruchko, because they 'violated their oath and betrayed their homeland',"" writes the Kyiv Independent. Naumov was the agency's former head of internal security, while Kryvoruchko headed the security service in Kherson oblast."
26269	21	Another issue is that which concerns Iryna Venediktova, who instead has been the attorney general since March 2020 and is considered another figure very loyal to the president. In these two years it has often been the object of criticism by the media and anti-corruption activists, who have underlined the inability to prosecute cases of a certain weight and denounced the sabotage of some corruption investigations against people close to Zelensky, including members of his party and his administration.
26269	23	"In short, the cases of Venediktova and Bakanov are causing a lot of discussion, but they are not the only ones. Before them, Roman Dudin, Sbu chief of Kharkiv, had also lost his job; Igor Sadokin, assistant to Kryvoruchko, head of the security service in Kherson oblast; Gennadii Lahutia, head of the military administration of Kherson. And on July 10, Zelensky had fired five of Ukraine's senior envoys abroad: these are the ambassadors to Germany, India, the Czech Republic, Norway and Hungary, even though the president spoke of ""rotation which is part of the normal practice of the diplomacy""."
26269	25	Could this long list of purges, which also affected inefficient officials and with some problems in terms of anti-corruption, also trace the contours of an unfinished coup? It is not clear. But this is what Zelensky's administration claims that the Kremlin has received reassurances from some Ukrainian officials - presumably those appointed by former pro-Russian premier Viktor Yanukovych - that there will be no resistance. It would then be a hidden operation, and potentially not yet completely thwarted, that would lead to a reorganization of power in Kyjiv.
2627	1	HALF WORLD AGAINST USA AND UKRAINE
2627	3	Daniel DePetris of the Defense Priorities think tank and Rajan Menon of the Institute for the Study of War and Peace. Saltzman (the Saltzman Institute of War and Piece Studies) of Columbia University in the article “The United States cannot force the rest of the world to support Ukraine. And here's why,” they sadly state: Washington's hopes that it would be able to turn the whole world against Russia did not materialize.
2627	5	The presidents of African, Latin American, Arab, Asian countries either partially supported the anti-Russian sanctions measures, and even then did it under pressure from the United States, or they verbally condemned the military operation of the RF Armed Forces (also under pressure from the United States), but refused to support the sanctions. Some have taken a position of friendly neutrality towards Moscow (Brazil, Mexico, India, South Africa, United Arab Emirates). The bravest (China, Venezuela, Syria, Cuba, Nicaragua) have not condemned the operation and have not supported the sanctions.
2627	7	The UAE has become an oasis for wealthy Russians. Those of them who are prevented from doing business and relaxing in Europe transfer their assets to the UAE. In terms of economic development, the UAE is almost equal to Switzerland, and UAE banks are always open to Russian clients.
2627	9	South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has accused the US and the EU of fomenting the conflict in Ukraine with their stupid policy of expanding NATO to the east.. Israel and Turkey, although they supply some types of weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces, are trying to keep the measure and not upset the general balance of Russia's political and economic interests.
2627	11	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's recent visits to Algeria and Oman and his forthcoming visit to Bahrain showed that Russia isolated from the outside world exists only in the minds of Ukrainian oligarchs.
2627	13	Commenting on the position of Arab countries on the Ukrainian issue for RT Arabic, Lavrov noted: “…they rely solely on their national interests and are not ready to sacrifice them for the sake of someone else's geopolitical opportunistic adventures. We have a relationship of mutual respect. We sympathize with the fundamental interests of Arab countries in relation to threats to their security. They reciprocate our sentiments and understand the threats to the security of the Russian Federation, created decades ago by the West right on our borders, trying to use Ukraine to contain Russia and cause us serious harm.”
2627	15	On the policy of the Anglo-Saxons, Lavrov said the following: “The impudence of the Anglo-Saxon alliance knows no bounds … Instead of following the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and respecting (as it is written in it) the sovereign equality of states, refusing to meddle in their internal affairs, the West daily through its ambassadors, emissaries in every capital, without exception, not only of the Arab world, but also of other regions sends ultimatums, brutally blackmailing on the basis of certain subjective situations. He directly threatens his interlocutors that they will repent and be punished if they do not join the sanctions against Russia. This is a blatant disrespect for sovereign states… The United States and Europe, in their historical style, still think in colonial terms…”
2627	17	Saudi Arabia refused, at the request of the United States, to increase oil production to reduce its prices and hit the Russian budget. Due to the sanctions, the production of black gold in Russia decreased by 1 million barrels, but this is an uncritical figure for the Russian economy. In April, Russia's revenues from oil sales alone reached 1.8 trillion rubles. And there are also gas, mineral resources, metals, agricultural products, etc.
2627	19	India doubled the volume of oil purchased from Russia compared to 2021. It got to the point that Washington threatened India with sanctions if it refused to stand up to Russia. India has so far refused. To appreciate the drama of the situation, one must understand that India is a fundamental ally for the United States in the Pacific region and a counterweight to China. Relations between India and China have always been full of conflicts and Washington hopes to trigger another war between India and China. And suddenly Washington has to threaten its ally, and even against the backdrop of Secretary of State Blinken's assertion that China is a more serious and long-term threat to the United States than Russia.
2627	21	"India has a traditionally hostile relationship with Pakistan. For this reason, Pakistan is a friend of China, and only recently was Pakistan an ally of Washington and India its adversary. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, in response to Brussels' request to support the anti-Russian resolution in the UN General Assembly, said: ""What are we, your slaves, who have to do everything you say?"""
2627	23	Imran Khan was removed from power with the help of the United States, but the new Pakistani prime minister has proved equally intractable.
2627	25	Indonesia has taken a clearly pro-Russian position. As the most influential country in ASEAN, it will not reduce the scope of cooperation with Russia. This position is typical of the entire organization. ASEAN's official statement on the war in Ukraine contains not even a hint of condemnation of Moscow's actions.
2627	27	Brazil earns 29 billion dollars from the export of agricultural products, the harvest depends 23% on Russian fertilizers. Why would Brazilians lose billions of dollars to support some buffoon in the form of a president in distant Ukraine? Brazil, like Mexico, had to condemn the special operation of the Russian armed forces, but strongly opposed the sanctions, rightly noting that their introduction would not lead to the end of the war. Let us add ourselves: only a fundamental rejection of pro-Nazi ideology and clinical Russophobia by Ukraine will lead to its demise.
2627	29	Germany, France, Italy and other EU countries are anti-Russian, but this does not prevent them from buying energy resources worth 0.7 billion euros from Russia every day. Austria and Switzerland, while supporting the EU and US policy towards Russia to a certain extent, do not enter into a tough confrontation with the Kremlin.
2627	31	“There is an important lesson to be learned from this,” write Da Petris and Manon, “For many countries outside North America and Europe, choosing a side in the confrontation between Russia and the West means losing the [old] strategy and incurring costs that outweigh the benefits… The United States cannot expect other states to sacrifice their interests to protect the US-established world order if Washington itself easily flouted the norms of that order when it deemed it expedient…
2627	32	They must not delude themselves about how much support the rest of the world will give to Ukraine… The US must prepare for the fact that it will have to experience disappointments, failures and possible defeats.
2627	34	The authors call Washington's violation of the world order the conquest of Kosovo and its transformation into a US protectorate in the Balkans with a large US military base, as well as an attack without UN approval on Iraq and turning this country into a source of instability for the entire Middle East.
2627	36	As befits Western propagandists, De Petris and Manon point out that Ukraine is not quite the same as Kosovo and Iraq, as it posed no threat to Russia. But this is a lie. There is a lot of evidence of the aggressive plans of the Kiev regime against Russia, and even more so the facts of mass destruction of the civilian population of Donbass.
26270	3	A hot summer risks being the prelude to a freezing winter. In one case it is the fault of climate change, with a heat wave that takes its toll and devours thousands of hectares between fires; in the second there are other deniers, those who have slowed down the exit plans from Russian gas and recognize the emergency only when the time (almost) is up.
26270	5	"Waiting to understand if Moscow will reopen the Nord Stream gas pipeline, stopped for ""maintenance"", and to know the European Union's plans to resist a possible closure of the taps, there is a fact that must be acknowledged to Mario Draghi . His government moved earlier, and better, than other European executives in diversifying supplies. So today Italy is one of the nations that has most effectively reduced energy imports from Russia. In some ways, our country has embodied an example of how to free oneself from the toxic relationship with the Kremlin."
26270	7	The return to Algeria is the last box in a series of journeys. The activism of the Prime Minister has sometimes anticipated the stages - and therefore the moves - of other European powers. The list of agreements closed in a few months is long: Azerbaijan, Angola, Congo, Israel, Qatar, Mozambique, Egypt. In recent days, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz met the Egyptian head of state Abdel al-Sisi, while Ursula von der Leyen is back from the mission in Baku. Emmanuel Macron instead received the president of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, with full honors at the Elysée.
26270	9	The buying and selling of hydrocarbons is inevitable to stop financing Vladimir Putin's brutal war, but the pilgrimages of the leaders mark the revaluation in the diplomatic relations of some nations in the past criticized for denied rights and not all of them mirror democracies. This is where Realpolitik redistributes the market shares previously covered by Russia, creating new dependencies.
26270	11	The agreement with Azerbaijan should be worth 20 billion cubic meters of gas by 2027 and, already in 2022, 12 billion cubic meters against 8.1 last year. As Il Foglio writes, the EU has responded to Putin's blackmail by practically halving imports via gas pipeline: -43% since the beginning of the year. They have been offset by incumbent suppliers, such as Norway and the UK, and with more purchases of liquefied natural gas. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) arrives mainly by ship: the United States has promised 50 billion cubic meters between now and 2030, but there is still no infrastructure, even if a large port in Portugal will be operational within six months.
26270	13	Due to the increase from 4 billion cubic meters to be added to the 2 already negotiated in April, Algeria will become Italy's first source. They helped ENI's established ties in the region. Oslo remains stable in second place, followed by Baku. In a short time, our country has managed to redesign its supplies, reducing its dependence on Moscow from 40 to 25% of gas imports, with the prospect of falling further.
26270	15	"It is thanks to this credibility that Draghi can push the proposal for a ceiling on the price of gas at a community level. At the moment, European reserves are 63% full: not enough to go through a winter without setbacks. The level of safeguard indicated by the European Commission is 80%, while for the International Energy Agency (IEA) it is necessary to reach 90%. A 2017 regulation outlines a solidarity mechanism between member states to share storage in the event of a supply crisis. Palazzo Chigi will try to ask for the price cap in exchange for access to its energy treasure, with a future as a ""gas hub"" in the Mediterranean."
26270	17	"Brussels' contingency plan goes so far as to provide for rationing in the extreme scenario. It will be essential to mobilize citizens. Changing our habits can make a difference: it's not rhetoric. According to Commission calculations, 11 billion cubic meters of gas can be saved by turning the thermostats down a few degrees. A moratorium on air conditioning will be recommended immediately, no more hibernation temperatures, and on heating towards the coldest season. It is a ""sacrifice"" that would be offensive to compare with those suffered after February 24 by the Ukrainian population."
26270	19	Then there are the other geopolitical costs of European repositioning. For example, the additional gas pumped by Algeria corresponds almost entirely to what Spain, its ten-year customer, no longer buys it. Algiers has suspended the friendship treaty with Madrid over the support of the government of Pedro Sánchez to the claims of its rival Morocco over the Western Sahara. And Algeria also figures among the count of abstentions in the motion condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the UN. In the Emirates, with which Paris strengthens its partnership, activists and journalists are often put in prison. Azerbaijan has a similar reputation, where protests are forcibly repressed. Baku had had no qualms about spending 3 billion dollars trying to bribe European politicians precisely to rehabilitate its image. Finally, the shameful cover-up of the murder of Giulio Regeni still burns with Egypt.
26270	21	"In Algiers, Draghi did not speak of the government crisis. In an international climate as hot as the meteorological one, the grillini are trying to shoot the premier with bullets. Sense of institutions zero. The side effect of the permanent assemblies of the Cinquestelle cannot be to overthrow the government which, in the midst of a war, inflation and the resurgence of the pandemic, is freeing us from energy slavery to the Kremlin. It would be yet another favor to Putin by Giuseppe Conte. Without the Tap which according to the pentastellati ""threatened the centuries-old olive trees"" of Puglia, then, freeing yourself from that addiction would have been impossible."
26271	1	"DRAGHI FALLS, PUTIN GODE - GRAMELLINI: ""EXCUSE THE MALICIOUS THINKING (IT WILL BE THE HEAT), BUT CONSIDERING THE COMMON POSITION OF COUNT AND SALVINI ON WAR, THE REAL MYSTERY IS NOT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS FALLEN, BUT HOW DID IT LAST UNTIL YESTERDAY…"""
26271	3	Among the harmful effects of global warming must be counted the summer madness of Italian politics. When scientists decide to take the question seriously, they will only be able to discover obvious connections between the increase in temperatures and the behavior of Salvini and Conte, already protagonists three summers ago of a double coup de theater which - now it can be said - was a double stroke of the sun and led one to bring down a government of which he was a minister and the other to remain in Palazzo Chigi with the support of the opposition.
26271	5	What has happened in recent days confirms the suspicions that some climatologists already advanced then: Conte slipped away from the emergency majority, certainly not because the emergency was over, but as soon as the barometer reached 38 degrees. While Salvini waited for him to reach 40 to distrust a government in which he had renewed his trust no later than last Thursday.
26271	7	However, it would be unfair to say that the heat has only affected them: it undermined Berlusconi's Ronzulli and Gelmini, who were reduced to bickering in the Senate like two motorists at traffic lights, and even scratched Draghi's aplomb, who, when he was unable to more precisely, he began to remove pebbles from his shoes that looked like Mont Blanc. By the way, excuse the malicious thought (it must be the heat), but given the common position of Conte and Salvini on the war, the real mystery is not that the government fell, but how it managed to last until yesterday.
26272	1	"It is the usual Berlusconi: ""Come on Italy at 20%, we will indicate the premier"". On defectors: ""They will disappear like Alfano"""
26272	3	"Rome, July 29 – Silvio Berlusconi does not give up and raises Forza Italia to 20%. In this convulsive phase of Italian politics, between imaginary Russian spies and hackers who bring down Draghi, the usual right and left sides that leave – especially now – the time they find, the 86-year-old Cavaliere takes the stage for a moment, releasing the usual ""Berlusconi-style"" declaration, i.e. the impossible one, which no one would ever imagine, as also reported by the Agi."
26272	5	"Berlusconi: ""Come on Italy at 20%, the premier will indicate"""
26272	7	"Already last month the Cav was unleashed in the same ""prediction"". Because Silvio Berlusconi is like this, not only with ""his"" Forza Italia. Indestructible, stubborn and megalomaniac, he almost needs to pursue impossible goals, in the dynamics that distinguish him. Then, for heaven's sake, life always reserves surprises. In 2013, no one expected his latest electoral exploit, yet, with an electoral campaign as a twenty-year-old, he managed to achieve almost 22% of the votes, for a party like the PDL that everyone was now declining. Now, of course, the undertaking is even more unlikely: Fi is a party that has been stationed for years under 10% of the votes, and raising it to the levels currently imagined by Berlusconi would be an electoral miracle. But the Knight is stubborn, a lot. His defect and resource of him, always."
26272	9	"The defectors ""will disappear like Alfano and Bondi"""
26272	11	"The grit of the character certainly cannot be questioned. At 86, Berlusconi has it for everyone, even for those who left Forza Italia after the fall of the Draghi government. In the statements published by Ansa, and released during the Zona Bianca broadcast, the president of Forza Italia expressed himself as follows: ""I am saddened because frankly I did not think they would find an advantage in going elsewhere, it has never happened for all those who have left from Forza Italia, from Alfano to Bondi they have disappeared and will disappear too“. Finally: “I will also campaign on social networks. I feel fit and I think I can do some convincing things and I think there won't be any rallies, at least I consider territorial presences useless"
26273	1	Wuhan, welcome back lockdown: 1 million people locked up for 4 asymptomatic cases
26273	3	Rome, July 28 - A piece of news that will make the Minister of Health Roberto Speranza and his faithful right-hand man Walter Ricciardi soar: the lockdown has returned to Wuhan. The Chinese authorities have ordered the confinement - for 3 days - of the population of Jiangxia, a suburb of the city, where about one million people live. The decision was taken following the emergence of 4 asymptomatic cases of coronavirus, stumbled upon the very dense meshes of the contagion control and tracing network in force in the Dragon country. This is the first time since 2020 that the Chinese metropolis, which has a total of 12 million inhabitants, has ordered a lockdown again.
26273	5	The lockdown returns to Wuhan
26273	7	"China therefore seems well-intentioned to maintain its ""zero Covid"" policy, keeping in place lockdowns, movement restrictions and large-scale tests, despite the fact that the more contagious and asymptomatic variants of the disease appear to be able to escape many of the measures of control. A policy, that of ""zero Covid"", increasingly at the center of controversy due to the very high social and economic costs, but considered indispensable by the authorities."
26273	9	The incredible case of Shenzhen
26273	11	As in Shenzhen, the southern technological hub of China, where although the health institutions claim to have limited the last outbreak of Covid-19 in the city, they have decided not to ease restrictions and extreme prevention measures. The authorities downgraded three zones from 'high risk areas' to 'medium risk' and five 'medium risk' zones to 'low risk' areas, designating another building as 'high risk'. In this specific area the law does not allow citizens to leave their homes while those in medium risk areas cannot leave their residential communities. Measures that appear incredibly harsh in the face of Chinese data on the contagion: on Wednesday 79 locally transmitted infections were reported throughout the country (of which only one in Shenzhen) and 41 imported cases.
26274	1	Sbarchi, Italy besieged by NGOs: 1,400 illegal immigrants are about to be unloaded
26274	3	Rome, July 28 - Are NGOs attacking Italy? Maybe not in a strictly military sense, but technically what we are about to witness in the next few days is yet another hecatomb against Lampedusa, the Italian coasts and, consequently, our sovereignty. The numbers reported by the Journal are impressive, and cannot be ignored.
26274	5	The NGO army attacks Italy: here's how
26274	7	"Three ships, all NGOs (granted), all loaded with illegal immigrants (pardon, ""migrants""), all headed for Italy: if it's not an army or a military naval fleet, we're close. We start with the usual Ocean Viking which carries 387. Then there is the Geo Barents, 232 people on board. Finally, the Sea Watch 3 which contains 438. Total, 1,421. With different destinies, the three ships veer straight towards our country. The Ocean Vikings, for example, moves near Italian territorial waters, near Lampedusa, while Sea Watch 3 is stationed near Pozzallo, a few kilometers from the limit. All while Lampedusa, as we said a few days ago, explodes."
26274	9	Lampedusa on its knees for weeks
26274	11	"The island is in a dramatic situation to say the least. The hotspot, already filled with almost 2,000 illegal immigrants in recent days, with a maximum capacity of half, could metaphorically (and perhaps even literally) catch fire. Because the landings have no intention of stopping. Those who promote the phenomenon do not want it, human traffickers and slavers do not want it, those who insist on oppressing the Italian people, innocent until proven guilty, by forcing them to suffer an invasion in their own homes do not want it. The record for landings in 24 hours was 29 in 2020, but it was largely knocked down by the hell of recent days: 32. And Lampedusa itself has already ""welcomed"" 600 people just last night. Egyptians, Syrians, Pakistanis, Tunisians, Bengalis. Still undocumented. And without rights. Like the Italians, after all."
26275	1	"""Radical chic environmentalists"": Rampini crushes Gretini and De Gregorio gets irritated (Video)"
26275	3	Whips to radical chic environmentalists and prompt response for Concita De Gregorio, irritated by the definition, as if she had been stung to the quick. Federico Rampini, hosts In Onda on La7, crushes the gretini, with an analysis that is difficult to dispute.
26275	5	Radical chic environmentalists, Rampini asphalt De Gregorio
26275	7	"“We talk about social justice. Sri Lanka is starving right now, literally starving. There were mass riots that forced the president to flee. A few years ago - thunders Rampini - their rulers had the good idea of ​​following the advice of radical chic Western environmentalists who advised them to convert agriculture to agro-biological methods. Crops have collapsed and there is no more food in Sri Lanka. The radical chic western environmental movement has this on its conscience, but it doesn't talk about it. It does not come to terms with its own mistakes, with its own insane visions inspired by an apocalyptic ideology and slogans that have nothing to do with reality""."
26275	9	Do you prefer ambient snobs? “Like when Greta…”
26275	11	"At that point De Gregorio, visibly annoyed, replies as a schoolteacher: ""I only distance myself from the radical chic definition regardless, sorry. I find it a formula that has now exceeded saturation and the limit of acceptability"". But Rampini doesn't get upset and corrects the shot with another broadside: ""Snob? Environmental snob? Like when Greta sails across the Atlantic, it's the height of snobbery."""
26275	13	"Considering his political background and style, someone could easily call Federico Rampini ""radical chic"" or ""snob"". However, for years the Corriere della Sera journalist has been writing articles and books that crush the drift of the left, not only in Italy. In this sense, his essay The Night of the Left is excellent."
26276	1	"""Global warming does not exist"", Libero's reporter dives into the Po and dies crushed"
26276	3	"Pavia – There was nothing to be done for Stefanos Sparacacazzadas, a 38-year-old Milanese journalist of Greek origins. The reporter, reporting to the newspaper ""Libero"", died instantly by crashing on the rocks, while performing a swan dive from the Becca bridge, in the Pavia area, to demonstrate that the Po river was not dry and that the heating global does not exist."
26276	5	"Sparacazzadas had announced the provocative feat from his Facebook profile the evening before the tragic accident: “Tomorrow morning I will have a nice swim in the clear, fresh and sweet waters of the Po. climate change to force us to give up the well-being of our Western lifestyle and stop us from buying more selfie sticks."""
26276	7	Unfortunately, the journalist kept his word and yesterday morning he showed up on time for his appointment with destiny, hoping to humiliate once and for all the villains of global warming and drought. Accompanying him was the freelancer videomaker Giacomo Giuarmuscio, whom Sparacacazzadas had hired to immortalize the feat, paying him with a cooked ham and fontina cheese sandwich.
26276	9	"Giarmuscio is the only witness to the tragedy, but his videos are incontrovertible proof of how the events took place. In the filming, now in the hands of the investigators, Sparacazzadas can be seen on the edge of the bridge ready to leap, while off-screen Giarmuscio's voice is heard trying for the last time to convince him not to do so: ""Can't you see that there are only stones ??? The riverbed is empty."" Giarmuscio then said that he had tried throughout the journey to the river to make Sparacacazzadas give up, but without results."
26276	11	"Shortly before the tragic flight Sparacacazzadas pronounced his last words on video: ""Here I am above the Po! I'm about to dive into its waters to prove that we are not taking any risks. The lefties and gretini will be asphalted by this demonstration. So we can go back to enjoying the world without those losers trying to make us feel guilty. W life!“"
26276	13	Although Sparacacazzadas' undertaking had not been agreed with the editorial staff and the management of Libero, for years the Milanese newspaper has adopted a negationist line also made up of provocative initiatives. And a few months ago another tragedy involving the journalist – also from Libero – Luca Contafaba, who died while inhaling from the exhaust pipe of a Porsche Cayenne to prove that CO2 and exhaust fumes are not all that harmful, and that we should have given up on luxury SUVs.
26276	15	"The entire Libero editorial team gathered around Sparacacazzadas' family and wanted to express their condolences in an official note: ""We are saddened by the tragic death of our colleague Stefanos, his passing leaves an unfillable void in all of us, but we are certain that his professionalism and generosity will accompany us forever, and in any case global warming does not exist“."
26277	1	Di Maio introduces the limit of the two splits
26277	3	Poltro (NA) – After the sensational break with the M5s and the birth of Together for (my) Future, Luigi di Maio finds himself firmly at the center of the Italian political scene. From the small Alpine village of Poltro, a hamlet of Pomigliano d'Arco, the Foreign Minister explained the objectives of his new formation in a brief meeting with journalists.
26277	5	"Di Maio immediately wanted to reassure the voters: ""Farewell to the M5S has no personal reasons, but it was necessary because the current political leader Giuseppe Conte, whom I don't even want to name, is not up to par with his predecessors, and I am certainly speaking of Vito Crimi. We remain against transformism and propose to return to the purity of the origins: we will introduce the limit of the two divisions, we certainly do not want to reach the extremes of a certain left""."
26277	7	"The political leader continued: ""For me the most important thing in politics is consistency, in fact I have always thought that only stupid people never change their minds"", and confirmed that decisions will still be made online by members, although he admitted that the platform used until last year by the M5S had major flaws: “Rousseau was a ciofeche, even Di Battista understood it. We will launch a much friendlier system, Uagliò“."
26277	9	"The technicians warn that the new platform will not be ready before 2030, but Di Maio guarantees that the leaders of his new formation will in any case act in the exclusive interest of the citizens: ""I assure you that our political action will be aimed exclusively at protecting the well-being of our constituents. And undoubtedly among our voters there are above all me: I proudly claim that I have always voted for myself, certainly not like any Adinolfi who presents himself in the elections and gets zero votes.”"
26277	11	"And to those who accuse him of careerism, of having become a professional politician, Di Maio replies firmly: “These insinuations make me think badly of those who spread them, and it is a sin to think badly, but often one guesses it. I'm just trying to make a contribution to the country: I'm aware of my limits, but I'm also sure I'm not surrounded by giants""."
26277	13	“Power wears out those who don't have it” finally commented the minister, taking leave of journalists by giving them the hump.
26278	1	In hot July in Italy there were 17 extreme events a day
26278	3	Drought, fires, but also storms, tornadoes and floods. From an atmospheric point of view, one of the worst months in recent history is closing. An analysis by Coldiretti
26278	5	A month of July ends which ranks among the hottest ever, marked however by an average of 17 extreme events per day along the peninsula including hailstorms, storms, tornadoes, water bombs and windstorms which have aggravated the drought damage amounting to over 6 billion euros in the countryside.
26278	7	This is what Coldiretti says with reference to the latest wave of bad weather that divided Italy in two with 10 red dot cities due to heat and bad weather alerts in 4 northern cities, based on data from the European Severe Weather Databases (Eswd).
26278	9	"We are facing - underlines Coldiretti in a note - an evident tendency towards tropicalization with a higher frequency of violent demonstrations, seasonal lags, short and intense rainfall and the rapid transition from heat to bad weather. Climate changes that cause damage because the land is unable to absorb water in a territory like the Italian one made more fragile by overbuilding and abandonment, with 7,252 municipalities, or 91.3% of the total, at hydrogeological risk according to Ispra data .
26278 11 Without forgetting that in 2022 there was an increase of +170% of fires driven precisely in a hot and dry month of July which favored the race of fire along the woods and countryside of the whole peninsula with damage to the environment, all economy, work and tourism, according to the analysis by Coldiretti on Effis data."
26278	13	The crops of corn, fodder, vineyards and fruit trees were affected by the latest disturbances in the countryside, but also damage to the roofs of buildings and sheds of farms with millions of euros in damages without however helping to defeat the water emergency situation in agriculture determined by heat and severe drought.
26278	15	"The level of the Po river at 3.3 meters below hydrometric zero at the Ponte della Becca ""is representative of the critical issues present on the entire Peninsula starting from the Po Valley where, due to the lack of water - the note underlines - it is threatened by more than 30 % of national agricultural production and half of livestock that give rise to the Italian food valley known throughout the world."
26278	17	"The situation of water shortage also affects the great lakes of the North with the Maggiore lake having just 16% of the reservoir filled and in that of Como it is even worse with just 5% while in the downstream areas water is needed for irrigation crops, and even Lake Garda is just under 1/3 full (31%)""."
26278	19	"Among the extreme weather events, ""the fall of hail in the countryside - says Coldiretti - is the most harmful in this seasonal phase due to the irreversible losses it causes to the crops right on the eve of the harvest, destroying an entire year of work. An event adverse climate that is repeated more and more frequently but the size of the grains is also changing, which has increased considerably in recent years with the fall of real blocks of ice even larger than a tennis ball""."
26278	21	"In the areas affected by the bad weather, Coldiretti is carrying out damage checks, which also warns of ""the worsening of the damage caused by drought"", which has a ""devastating impact on national production which has led to an estimated 10% drop of national agricultural production."
26279	1	Biden and Xi Jinping agree to meet in person, but tensions remain high on Taiwan
26279	3	"More than two hours of conversation between the two leaders. The White House: ""No to unilateral actions that threaten peace and stability"". The Chinese president: ""It's a mistake to consider us opponents"" and warns ""those who play with fire get burned"""
26279	5	"China warns the United States that ""those who play with fire get burned"" and reiterates that it will not allow interference in the increasingly delicate issue of Taiwan."
26279	7	Tensions on the island occupied much of the fifth telephone conversation between the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the president of the United States, Joe Biden, a few days before the expected visit to Taiwan by the speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. However, the two leaders agreed on the possibility of meeting in person.
26279	9	The Pelosi mission that irritates Beijing
26279	11	"The mission, still unconfirmed, would constitute the visit to Taiwan by the highest-level US official in the last 25 years, and has already deeply irritated Beijing, which in recent days has sent increasingly clear messages to the United States of its intolerance: the last today, when the Ministry of Defense defined the ""reunification"" of the island with China, even if it is not peaceful, a ""sacred mission"" and warned Washington that the risk of a military confrontation is increasing."
26279	13	"Beijing's stance is ""consistent,"" Xi told Biden, ""and it is the firm will of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people to resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity."""
26279	15	"Beijing will never leave room ""in any form"" for the ""forces of Taiwan independence"", as China defines the island's authorities, and calls on Washington to respect the one-China principle, which for Beijing implies sovereignty over Taiwan , and of the three joint communiques on which the two powers established diplomatic relations. The purpose of today's telephone conversation, the first since March 18, was to ""maintain and deepen lines of communication"" with China, underlined the White House, and ""responsibly manage our differences and work together where our interests align"", but the question of Taiwan continues to remain the most intricate issue to be resolved in relations between Washington and Beijing."
26279	17	"Biden reiterated that US policy towards the island ""has not changed"", but also that the US ""strongly opposes unilateral attempts to change the status quo or to undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" , in what appears to be an implicit reference to Beijing's increased aggressiveness due to economic, diplomatic and military pressure on the island."
26279	19	The ceiling on the price of Russian gas
26279	21	"In the background remain the differences on the great chapters of the global chessboard. Xi and Biden ""exchanged views on the Ukrainian crisis,"" state broadcaster China Central Television said without going into detail."
26279	23	Expectations were for discussions regarding a ceiling to be imposed on the price of Russian oil, already sanctioned in the West for the invasion of Ukraine by Moscow's soldiers.
26279	25	"For Beijing, this is a ""complicated issue"", even if China aims to strengthen communication with Washington on ""important"" issues, among which it expressly mentions those related to food and energy security."
26279	27	Cooperation
26279	29	"Finally, China urges the United States to cooperate against the Covid-19 pandemic and the risks of recession, and warns that considering the Dragon as an ""adversary"" and a ""long-term challenge"" will not help the US economy."
26279	31	"On the contrary, for Beijing, China and the United States ""should maintain communication at all levels, make good use of existing communication channels and promote bilateral cooperation""."
2628	1	If voting helped, the No Vaxes wouldn't let it.
2628	3	"A recent survey by the famous Pagnoncelli gave the ""no vax party"" at 30%. Was it perhaps an alarm message for the control room of the Great Reset? For sure, it's a comforting message for the resilient social bloc. If ever there was a party that had the abolition of the green pass and any form of compulsory vaccination as its primary objective, it would be enough to go and vote. In the best of hypotheses it could be a party capable of going into government, in a more realistic hypothesis, a party capable of exercising a real opposition, able at least to slow down the path they are imposing with forced steps, to divert this dystopian trajectory that will mark the end of democracy."
2628	5	"Never would a vote be so heartfelt. Even many of the vaccinated would vote for the ""no vax"" party."
2628	7	The front resistant to the health technodictatorship is wide and varied, there are many realities of every political background, just as there are many people who do not have a precise political ideal, but who rather have religious and spiritual inclinations. In any case, the front would be united by the only shared objective, the only one that legitimizes the idea of ​​the party itself: the abolition of the pass and the vaccination obligation. A party with a single goal. Then we will agree on the rest.
2628	9	"""If voting made any difference, they wouldn't let us."" Someone said in other times, always recent, lived in the great deception of liberal democracy, the petal term to define the oligarchic system. The political conquests of the masses have been undone and we have in fact returned to the 19th century, in a sort of cyberpunk dystopian novel, where modern global oligarchies have much more powerful and refined means of social control. Even if today there is universal suffrage, there are many more ways to direct the vote of the masses, and in case of failure, to falsify the result of the elections."
2628	11	"It is probably an esoteric message to have won the American elections to an elderly man with a principle of senile dementia, involved in cases of international corruption, together with his son, the heir who loves to spend his free time smoking crack and uploading videos on his PornHub channel. The message, addressed to those who can understand it, could be this: ""It is useless to try the path of elections - We have also taken this away from you"". “We decide who gets to be the most powerful man in the world. If we don't do it with propaganda then we rig the election, and we'll pretend we never did it” – “We did it in the United States, we can do it anywhere”."
2628	13	"Assuming you don't care about these messages and go straight on your own path, you need to think about the actual potential represented by an Italian no-vax party. Above all, two important factors must be considered: the first is that Italy is now a country controlled by the global financial oligarchy, the second is that the ""emergency situation"" can once again be used to suspend democracy."
2628	15	"Throughout its history as a nation state, Italy has never really been a sovereign country, probably not even during the twenty years, but the collapse of the Soviet Union also marked the end of that leeway of our political class, the little bit of self-determination that we tasted in small doses after World War II. From Tangentopoli onwards, autopilot came on: DS, Ulivo, PD or Forza Italia and Lega similarly carried forward the neoliberal agenda, in one way rather than another. Today, 30 years later, the no vax party would be a small party alone against everyone, it is impossible to find any form of alliance with the system parties, in this case FdI and Lega, which the globalist oligarchy uses as a fake opposition in order to maintain the image of democracy. This no vax party, as mentioned at the beginning, could realistically only play the role of a true opposition front. But even here, history teaches. The suspension of democracy, understood in its purely electoral sense, can be implemented with the excuse of an ""emergency situation"". As happened in 2011, where the sovereign debt crisis, artificially induced by the Oligarchy, was used as a bogeyman thanks to which the mass media of the same Oligarchy terrorized public opinion which thus managed to legitimize, indeed to make the people invoke a loud voice, the seizure of political power by their own torturers: the technicians led by Mario Monti who inaugurated the season of tears and blood, of that ferocious austerity made in Italy."
2628	17	"It is not difficult to think that the scheme to be re-proposed today during the ""health emergency"" is the same one applied during the ""economic emergency"" of 10 years ago. It is not difficult to think that the media power that the Oligarchy has is sufficient to legitimize the outlawing of the No Vax Party in the eyes of public opinion. They have already demonstrated, and made a large portion of the population accept it, that democracy can be suspended in the name of health."
26280	3	The Research Institute for Hydrogeological Protection of the Cnr in a study highlights how climate change affects high-altitude environments. And it develops the 'cadastre' of events
26280	5	In 85 percent of cases, high-altitude instability events are associated with a temperature anomaly, and the role of positive temperature anomalies increases from spring to winter, and with the altitude and volume of the event.
26280	7	These, in a nutshell, are the conclusions of an analysis conducted by the Research Institute for Hydrogeological Protection of the National Research Council (Cnr-Irpi) which, in a note, illustrates the tools used to monitor glacial masses and the related phenomena of instability, such as for example the recent collapse of the Marmolada ice.
26280	9	The presence of glacial masses has always been associated with the possibility of potentially dangerous instabilities for human activities, such as large collapses of glacial fronts and sudden glacial floods.
26280	11	The study of instabilities
26280	13	The Cnr-Irpi has been operating for over thirty years in the field of studies relating to the documentation of instability phenomena in the glacial environment, with particular reference to the characterization of the dynamics of glaciers, the reconstruction of past events and the analysis of the factors involved in the initiation of instability phenomena.
26280	15	Thanks to the knowledge and skills acquired in the context of research projects and national and international scientific collaborations (such as GLACIORISK and GLARISKALP), the Cnr-Irpi has contributed to the implementation of the only specific database still existing at European level on glacial risks (http ://www.nimbus.it/glaciorisk/gridabasemainmenu.asp) and the drafting of the International Guidelines for the definition and mitigation of glacial risks (https://www.gaphaz.org/).
26280	17	One of the most important challenges today is understanding the impact of climate change on glacial masses and their instability, also considering the growing attendance of high-altitude environments and therefore the increase in related risks.
26280	19	Glacial instability phenomena are reported to be increasing all over the world, including in Italy, however for statistically based conclusions it is necessary to consolidate national and international strategies for the systematic documentation of this type of phenomena, explains Marta Chiarle, researcher of the Institute .
26280	21	To contribute to knowledge in this field, the Cnr-Irpi has a research focus on high mountains which concerns both the role of climatic and geomorphological evolution in the predisposition and triggering of instability processes in environments with cryosphere (snow, glaciers and permafrost), and the integration of high-frequency monitoring systems for the characterization of instability phenomena in glacial environments.
26280	23	The 'cadastre' of instabilities
26280	25	As regards the first aspect - adds Chiarle - we have implemented and put online a register of instability events at high altitudes (https://geoclimalp.irpi.cnr.it/catasto-frane/): the dataset analysis highlighted how in 85% of cases the events are associated with some temperature anomaly and how the role of positive temperature anomalies increases from spring to winter, and with the altitude and volume of the event.
26280	27	As for the monitoring systems, Daniele Giordan explains that the research activities carried out in collaboration with the Montagna Sicura Foundation and the Valle d'Aosta Region have led to the creation of the Open Air Laboratory of the Grandes Jorasses, where the Planpincieux glacier is monitored and the Whymper serac with a unique monitoring system in the world.
26280	29	Over the years, this monitoring system has made it possible to acquire a significant amount of information on the dynamics of the Planpincieux and Grandes Jorasses glaciers, on which the development of a risk management protocol relating to the possible collapses of significant portions of the two glaciers.
26280	31	"The researcher Daniele Giordan adds ""the open-air laboratory of the Grandes Jorasses is a virtuous example of the collaboration between research institutions and land management; born out of a need for civil protection, the laboratory is also a space in which to carry out research of the highest level based on the most technologically advanced systems, the results of which are used in the development of new monitoring techniques and in the strengthening of the site management protocol""."
26280	33	"The director Tommaso Moramarco, director of the Cnr-Irpi concludes: ""The Cnr-Irpi therefore possesses a know-how and set of data on glacial risks of fundamental importance for assessing the danger in the high mountains. This knowledge can usefully be put at the service of the Country for the drafting of national guidelines for the assessment of glacial risks, with particular attention to the effects of climate change in progress, citizen training and dissemination, in order to know and experience the high mountains in safety."
26280	35	"Added to this is the scientific and technological know-how of the Cnr-Irpi which places it at the forefront in the monitoring of unstable glacial bodies. All this knowledge is made available to decision-making bodies and local government to do everything possible to ensure that tragedies like the Marmolada do not repeat themselves""."
26281	1	For Italian families, the price increase is a 9 billion sting
26281	3	"Analysis by Coldiretti on Istat data: ""Vegetables lead the list of price increases, which this year will cost Italian families a total of 1.97 billion more"""
26281	5	The price increase triggered by the war in Ukraine will cost Italian families almost 9 billion euros in 2022 for food spending alone, due to the effect of inflation which mainly affects the weakest categories.
26281	7	This is what emerges from the analysis by Coldiretti, based on Istat data on Italian consumption and the trend of inflation in the first six months of the year, released during the National Assembly at Palazzo Rospigliosi in Rome.
26281	9	Leading the ranking of price increases is vegetables which this year will cost Italian families a total of 1.97 billion more - underlines Coldiretti - and precedes bread, pasta and rice on the podium, with an increase of 1.65 billion, and meat and cured meats, for which expenditure is estimated to be 1.54 billion higher than in 2021.
26281	11	In fourth place is fruit - continues Coldiretti - with 0.92 billion, ahead of milk, cheese and eggs (0.78 billion), fish (0.77 billion) and oil, butter and fats (0.59 billion) which is however the category that saw prices run the most in the first six months of 2022.
26281	13	"The categories ""mineral waters, soft drinks and juices"", ""sugar, jams, honey, chocolate and sweets"", ""coffee, tea and cocoa"" and ""salt, condiments and baby food"" follow with smaller additional payments."
26282	1	Orlando, 'o Minister Capocorrente protected by Napolitano and rival of Calenda
26282	3	How did a communist leader, without art or party, climb the PCI, then PDS, then DS and finally Pd until he became minister three times? Mystery...
26282	5	Minister Andrea Orlando? Among the greatest mysteries of the Italian Republic. Protected by Napolitano, it now also thrives under Letta...
26282	7	"The scenario is the mythical one of those that are still called ""Unity Festivals"". We are in Caracalla, an atmosphere that smells of centuries, immersed in the suffocating heat of the Roman August nights. Wandering among the tables you can still see the carbonaras and sausages, the white wine of the Castelli, the spicy olives, the homemade bread and that Strapaesana atmosphere of a trip to Ostia from the black and white films of the 1950s with Alberto Sordi (who the other had a beautiful villa right here)."
26282	9	Suddenly, however, people stop their jaws and look up in astonishment. He speaks. Andrea Orlando speaks. An Olympic echo, from the Istituto Luce newsreel, reverberates from the croaking popular speakers, magnetizing the attention and raising the adrenaline of the militants.
26282	11	"“We have an exceptional situation, we have to give a clear message. Yesterday Calenda ran for prime minister, today he censored the interventions he did not like in the direction of the Democratic Party. I launch an appeal to Calenda: calm down"". And what happened? He even speaks of an ""exceptional situation"" and one immediately thinks of war, Covid, the mafia, world hunger, the atomic bomb and instead he talks about Calenda ."
26282	13	"Disappointment and murmurs in the background, seasoned with stubborn profanity, true masterpieces of linguistic refinement to make a lifer in prison blush. So the patrons, animated by that cynical Roman spirit of someone who has now seen everything in almost three thousand years of history with a capital S, resume unleashing and never let go. Someone compassionate tries to remove the microphone from him on stage, but he - perhaps inspired by the historical location - does not give up his ""Calendiade""."
26282	15	"In the end they brutally cut off the microphone as only the heirs of that popular party that was the communist one can do, all by simulating a non-existent technical failure. This happened last night and it's just a starting point to talk a little about what is now the new ""'o Minister"" once called Paolo Cirino Pomicino."
26282	17	Andrea Orlando (53) is one of those mysteries of the Italian Republic that when historians study this period they will not be able to solve. Carneade gives him a large mustache. In fact, how can a very obscure Ligurian communist leader, without art or part, climb that monolith that was the PCI, then PDS, then DS and finally Pd until he became minister three times, first for the Environment, then for Justice and currently for Labor , as well as pluri-Deputy?
26283	1	"Migrants used as a weapon by Russia? ""Driven to Italy by the Wagner group"""

26283	5	"Migrants pushed into Italy by the Russians of the Wagner group. Salvini: ""We are at comedies"""
26283	7	"Migrants used by Russia as an instrument of pressure on Italy and Europe. This is supported by an article at the beginning of today's Repubblica, which claims that ""many more hulls are leaving from the ports of Cyrenaica controlled by the brigade of Russian fighters than in the last two years. To put our country and Europe under pressure"" ."
26283	9	"According to Repubblica, ""many more migrants are leaving from the coasts of Libya under the control of General Haftar's militias supported by the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group than in the last two years. They set sail from two areas in particular - the coasts near the ports of Derna and of Tobruk — which were sleeping.”"
26283	11	"Repubblica quotes a qualified source of the Italian security apparatus: ""Libya is a cannon aimed at the electoral campaign: immigration is perhaps the most powerful weapon for those who have an interest in destabilizing and, therefore, interfering in the September vote"". And the article continues: ""Our intelligence services had already launched the first alert a few weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine: the Kremlin can use its influence in Cyrenaica to increase the departures of asylum seekers. In June a new alert, more detailed""."
26283	13	"And Repubblica always concludes: “In recent days, in conjunction with the crisis in the Draghi government, the signals collected from the ground have left no more doubts. The tap has been turned on. bogeyman of the invasion of migrants: first of all, Matteo Salvini""."
26283	15	"When questioned, Salvini replied: ""For the left, it would be Putin who would push the boats full of illegal immigrants towards Italy. We are at comedy, the fear of losing his seat plays bad jokes"", declared the leader of the League. “Spoiler: Pd and Lamorgese are to blame,” he adds."
26286	1	The left that cries out for black danger is a film we have already seen: the Italians have discovered the trick
26286	3	For many years the left has been the NOT-Right. In the absence of ideas and programs, she delights in what she is a skilled teacher of, namely denigrating, insulting and trying to tarnish her political opponent, the right, with all available means. Clearing the field of hypocrisy, today the most formidable opponent at the polls is the leader of FdI Giorgia Meloni.
26286	5	It is she who holds the majority of votes, she who will unquestionably be the driving force behind a dreaded victory for the centre-right, she who with determination, consistency and ability has come to be the leading Italian party.
26286	7	The left cannot accept this and since the fall of the Draghi government it has been unleashed in a fight against the massacre to try to cast a shadow on the one who took away the light for everyone.
26286	9	Fortunately, among the progressive ranks there are voices that do not align with the boorish narrative of a left that is showing its total political inconsistency.
26286	11	"The more he tries to warn voters of the danger of ""fascism"" with a winning right led by Meloni, the more he demonstrates the lack of ideas and programs on which it would be legitimate to focus the electoral campaign."
26286	13	"But the truth is that today the left being dominated by a sovereign chaos, seeks in ""sovereignty"" the enemy to be overthrown."
26286	15	"A few days ago Michele Serra, a journalist from Repubblica, a newspaper that immediately embraced the mockery campaign against Giorgia Meloni, not sparing her headlines and photos of such violence and vulgarity worthy of petty newspapers, wrote: ""it is not convenient to the left to insist on antimelonism as the pivot of the electoral campaign. Let us suspect that we talk about the enemy rather than say what we want to do between friends”."
26286	17	Finally a progressive signature that with lucid objectivity has told his followers to stop insulting them and put ideas into the field, provided they can obviously find any.
26286	19	The most authoritative Italian signature, the twice director of Corriere della Sera, son of the director of the Unit, director of the Press, president of RCS libri, highly esteemed by Eugenio Scalfari who hired him at L'Espresso, Paolo Mieli, made the his voice during the Agorà Estate program this morning.
26286	21	Here are his words:
26286	23	"""Every second to talk about fascism, to insinuate that with Giorgia Meloni fascism returns because in some section there is the black baron .. We have seen a story already written in the countryside in Rome ... now a judicial investigation will emerge where it will be found that in the so-and-so section there is one who has the bust of Mussolini, who has given the Roman salute."
26286	25	These things make color so they will bounce in the international press. But do you really think that there is someone in Italy who thinks that if Meloni, Berlusconi and Salvini win, fascism or something similar will return? It is completely implausible.
26286	27	The center-left can delude itself if some judge brings out someone who has done the Roman salute for 2 or 3 days, dance in the newspapers and abroad for this matter, for them everything can be a game. In my opinion it is not true. Separating the two issues and making a modern campaign is absolutely effective. There will soon be the march on Rome and to insinuate that there are subliminal events linked to Fascism including my newspaper, is painful, mortifying for the intellectuals who lend themselves and harmful.
26286	29	There is no need to open a debate on Fascism and Meloni because I am also very convinced that Meloni will not establish any fascist regime should it win the elections.
26286	31	It is absurd even to talk about it“
26286	33	Let's treasure the words of this great signature and leave the pennivendoli the freedom to continue to make disinformation and mockery.
26286	35	The Italians have now discovered the trick.
26287	1	"The 5 stars and relations with Moscow. Il Giornale reveals the true ""friends of Putin"""
26287	3	"Relations with Moscow and foreign policy ignite the Italian electoral campaign. After the storm launched by the pages of the newspaper La Stampa, on the ties between Matteo Salvini's League and an official of the Russian embassy to bring down the Draghi government, already resoundingly denied by Salvini who defined them ""fake news"" followed by Undersecretary Gabrielli who pointed out the extraneousness of the secret services in the affair, the Giornale reveals who are ""Putin's true friends""."
26287	5	"The Russia-Salvini case is just fake news. ""Without foundation"", the denial that makes noise"
26287	7	"If Salvini has to clarify in the appropriate forums what are the relations between his party and the Moscow embassy, ​​even the 5 stars would have something to explain. From Giuseppe Conte to Di Battista, here are all the grillini who should ""blush"" for their past pro-Putin positions. Just the pentastellato leader, recalls Il Giornale, last June received an endorsement from the Moscow ambassador Sergey Razov on the no to arms in Kiev. But going back in time, Conte should remember that when he was prime minister ""he praised his friend Putin"" and agreed with him on the controversial mission of the Russian military in Bergamo battered by Covid. And then there is Beppe Grillo, who in 2017 in an interview with the French weekly Journal du Dimanche noted: ""International politics needs strong men like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin"""" underlines Il Giornale."
26287	9	Here is the Russian dossier to muddy Salvini. The thunderous denial of the secret services
26287	11	"But there is also the former grillino Di Battista, who could rejoin the Movement for the next elections, having just returned from a trip to Russia to make reports for Il Fatto Quotidiano. ""On the web you can still find photos of Di Battista and Di Stefano smiling next to two Putin loyalists Robert Shlegel and Sergey Zheleznyak. And it must be said that only two years had passed since the Russian annexation of Crimea and the consequent sanctions damage to the Kremlin"" explains Il Giornale, casting doubt on the newfound Atlanticist faith of the Undersecretary of the Farnesina Manlio Di Stefano. ""Only a few years ago, Luigi Di Maio's right-hand man was the leader of Italian Putinism. In June 2015, the former grillino spoke in the Chamber of Deputies thus of the pro-European riots of 2014 in Kiev: «A coup financed by Europe and the USA"". Today his words about a Ukrainian government led by ""convinced neo-Nazis"" are particularly sinister"". And again, again Di Stefano two years later was the protagonist of an expedition to Moscow to participate in the congress of Russia"" together with Di Battista."
26287	13	"And again, the Giornale continues, Chiara Appendino, the former mayor of Turin, was also a regular visitor to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. But going back to today to the Five Stars, one could ask if it is true that among the ""suitable candidates for political candidates in the pentastellati lists there are names such as those of Alessandro Orsini and Michele Santoro. Both opposed to military aid to Ukraine and accused of wire -Putinism"". Finally, there are also the former grillino Vito Petrocelli, ousted from the presidency of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission for his positions close to the Kremlin and Senator Bianca Laura Granato, who declared after the outbreak of war in Ukraine that «Putin is fighting a fight for all of us."""
26288	1	Climate change is destroying human health. The terror of Walter Ricciardi
26288	3	Climate-sensitive diseases account for about 70% of global deaths, with cardiovascular disease accounting for the largest share (32.8%). It is one of the data contained in the report «Climate change in Italy: the impact on human health and adaptation processes. The Italian scenario in the light of the document Climate Change Is A Health Crisis», created by the Italian Institute for Planetary Health (IIPH), an Institute with an international scope, born in 2019 from the collaboration between the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research IRCCS and the 'Catholic University, which aims to safeguard human health while also keeping our planet in good health.
26288	5	The research underlines how the impact of climate change is highly harmful to human health and well-being, and highlights how Italy, in the European context, is currently the country that is paying the highest price as confirmed, for example, by data relating to fires: in 2021, in fact, Italy was the country in the OECD area with the highest number of fires recorded: 1,422. After Turkey, ours was the second country for burnt area with 159,537 hectares. This is numerically the highest figure recorded in the last decade. From wildfires to heat waves, the figure doesn't change. In 2020, Italy recorded one of the largest temperature increases in all of Europe, with +1.54 C compared to the average for the period 1961-1990 and continues to overheat faster than the global average. These numbers, also confirmed by the increasingly alarming data linked to the victims of climate disasters, which in Europe have exceeded the number of 650 thousand cases in the last 50 years, have prompted health experts to issue an alarm to the institutions.
26288	7	"For Walter Ricciardi, Full Professor of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, «the United Nations Report on climate change, published two months ago, has been silenced. In Italy it has not had any audience, yet it is strange, we are seeing it these days, because ours is one of the countries most affected by climate change and perhaps the one that needs the most urgent interventions. Italy is the country that has had the highest number of fires in Europe, the second in the world, and that has the highest desertification, as we are seeing from the drought of the Po, from the difficulty of irrigating the Po Valley. It is the country that is experiencing the most heat waves, the one that is seeing the onset of new infectious diseases from vectors, there are already 3 deaths from West Nile Fever, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which are returning to infest important parts of our territory. It is important to fight this climate change, we have the solutions but they are largely ignored, also because this has a huge impact on the population's mental health and well-being""."
26289	1	"Giorgia Meloni, lesson on the left: ""Who votes for us as illiterate?"""
26289	3	"The electoral campaign is raging, very short and steamy. From the left, cross-attacks, disorganized and violent, rained down on the centre-right. Favorite targets are Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini. The choruses? Fascism, Russia, black wave, democratic danger and all the assortment we know well. The fear is that the judiciary, always very ""attentive"" to the elections in Italy, may soon move. A thought that unites Alessandro Sallusti, director of Libero, and Paolo Mieli, signature of Corsera: both, in fact, have prophesied a ""judicial bang"" for the end of August. And in this sense, the first rumors are starting to filter through the prosecutors. We'll see."
26289	5	"Meanwhile, Meloni replies to the accusations of the left. Not so much to those that have affected you and the party you lead, Brothers of Italy, but to those that affect center-right voters. Yes, often portrayed as ignorant, denigrated, belittled: the eternal, irrepressible and unbearable superiority complex of the left. That complex which, it must be said, condemns the left to perpetual defeat: as Matteo Renzi says, to draw a name from the deck, campaigning not on the content but on how ""bad"" the opponent is is a losing strategy."
26289	7	"But, it was said: Meloni. The FdI leader relaunched a short video excerpt on Twitter showing her at the Versiliana, in Marina di Pietrasanta, in Versilia. During a meeting, you rail against the hegemony of power of the left, very different from cultural hegemony. ""I do not accept the story that whoever is not from the left is worthless and whoever votes for the centre-right is illiterate. You don't need a party card to deserve something and I want to restore pride to all the people who, for years, have had to hide get where they wanted"", Giorgia Meloni thunders, relaunching the images that you can see below."
2629	1	"For the puppeteer of the ""great reset"", war will make us greener"
2629	3	"The patron of the World Economic Forum churns out another book, a cookbook of banality with a single ""narrative"": Among the many negative sides, conspiracies have at least one positive: they are interesting, sometimes even funny. The plans for world conquest drawn up by secret societies throughout history - however evil - are still fascinating, rich material for documentaries and investigative books. Well, the ideas of Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and theorist of the Great Reset, do not even have this merit. Indeed, they are of a disconcerting banality. On closer inspection, it's not even about conspiracies, because Schwab makes no secret of anything, he puts everything in black and white on the page, he exposes his vision of the world and his projects for epochal change in books that have very wide circulation. It is as if the man hid his plots in full light: his tomes are so boring that one abandons reading after a couple of pages, therefore understanding what he has in mind is truly a feat . Page after page you have to force yourself, keep your eyes from closing and try to make your way through the mountains of crap that Schwab accumulates without remorse."
2629	5	"This is particularly valid for the last volume signed together with the researcher Thierry Malleret, which has just arrived in Italian bookstores and entitled The great narration (Franco Angeli). It is the sequel to The Great Reset and, if possible, it is even more terrifying. According to the authors, it is ""a call to collective and individual action"". The central thesis is quickly exposed on the first page, and the almost 200 remaining are completely useless. Schwab explains that ""if we are to ensure a better future for humanity, the world must be more resilient, more equitable and more sustainable"". As you can see, nothing different from what can be read every day in the so-called mainstream media. And in fact the tome is a kind of condensation of the prevailing amenities, in some way the author tries to trace the boundaries of the ""single thought"", providing a very light ideological scaffolding to the various politically correct preachers."
2629	7	"The entire essay is pervaded by a sickening display of good feelings. Schwab draws the contours of a humanity that lives in peace, respects the environment, balances the scales of social justice, responds unitedly to the various crises that arise. It is the proverbial ""heaven on earth"" that all progressives and revolutionary Gnostics have been proposing since the beginning of time. At times, Schwab's variation on the theme is grotesque, for example when he suggests holding ""empathy courses"" to stimulate human solidarity."
2629	9	"Underneath this sticky veneer, however, the disturbing aspects emerge. The first is the cardinal principle of the Great Reset: «Change is always painful, so we should take advantage of the fact that we are in a critical juncture to implement the necessary measures that can correct most of the things that have gone wrong for so many years in the past ». In short, it is a question of exploiting crises, if not of provoking them in order to give fundamental changes to humanity. Disasters can facilitate the implementation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (the technological and digital one), since ""the bigger the problem and the more serious the threat, the greater the drive to cooperate to find a solution""."
2629	11	Small inconvenience: Schwab often talks about cooperation, but the purpose of this cooperation has already been decided by him (or someone else), and there is no possibility of discussion. It is necessary, without ifs, ands or buts, to make the green turnaround, to make the entire system sustainable: «The «green» changes necessary throughout the economic system [...] constitute, in fact, the only possible growth story, because a long-term high-carbon growth story is no longer viable.
2629	13	"Sustainability, therefore. The concept is overwhelmingly brutal: «Sustainability is normally defined as the ability to satisfy our needs without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy theirs». Crystal clear: the system based on desire and the satisfaction of mostly induced needs must remain standing, simply human beings must be recalibrated so that the banquet lasts longer, and future generations also have their place at the table. In short, we have to adapt, give up something and get used to the shocks. We must be resilient, because ""the pandemic has amplified the importance of resilience: the ability to thrive even in times of adversity and to recover from difficult circumstances"". Translated, resilience is the ability to suffer in silence, without complaining."
2629	15	Among the main enemies that the nice Klaus mentions in the book are, not surprisingly, populists and no vax. “Populism tends to be bad for sustainability: there is a strong correlation between populism and climate skepticism; populism brings demagogues to power, who then offer oversimplified solutions to complex problems. As for critics of the health regime, “the powerful anti-science movements prolong the slow decline phase of the Covid pandemic by hindering both public health and, more fundamentally, our ability to move forward in unison”.
2629	17	What does Schwab's proposal ultimately consist of? In a generic progressivism cloaked in noble demands on collective and individual well-being, which in reality becomes an indisputable drive to cut emissions and achieve the green turnaround and to increase the presence of technology in our lives.
2629	19	"To illustrate this vast program (already being implemented), Schwab interviewed dozens of experts around the world, many of whom belonged to the liberal universe. They are useful in building the ""grand narrative"" that lies at the heart of the new work of the head of the Wef. Following the lesson of philosophers of language who think they can redraw reality by changing words, Schwab explains that «a new world is emerging (not a «new normal») whose contours will be largely defined by the discourses that will develop for chart the way forward"". Like spells, narratives allow you to conquer minds, orient public opinion, and put change into practice without using an iron fist."
2629	21	"We have had numerous proofs of the functioning of this method during the pandemic: a prevailing discourse is constructed, and it is imposed on the population. Those who oppose it (the aforementioned populists and no vax) must be demonized and marginalized. This is how it is working with the war in Ukraine too, and it is interesting that Schwab hosted Volodymyr Zelensky at his home in Davos just yesterday. Indeed, the Ukrainian president has shown that he can deftly wield the power of storytelling. For the occasion, Zelensky asked to increase the sanctions on Russia and to block the purchase of oil. Above all, he invited those present in Davos to ""take part in the reconstruction"" of his country. And he concluded with a catchphrase: ""I hope that each of you will be able to wake up in the morning wondering: what can I do for Ukraine today?"". Interesting question, which can also be changed direction, formulating it from Schwab's point of view."
26290	3	"Et voilà: the invasion is served. 40,000 irregular landings on our coasts from January 1 to today were not enough, 11,000 more than last year, triple that of 2020 and ten times those of 2019, when Matteo Salvini was Minister of the Interior. No: in terms of indiscriminate reception, Italy can, but above all must, do more. This was decided by the European Court of Justice, with a sentence inevitably destined to intensify traffic on the Mediterranean motorway, the summary of which is this: NGO ships can no longer be blocked in the ports of call unless ""obvious danger to safety, health or the environment"". But be careful: ""safety"" does not include the number of people on board, even if that of migrants is much higher than the limit allowed on the hull. The only limit will be the hygienic-sanitary conditions on the ship, but once the ship has landed those will now count for very little, and in any case (see the article below) the NGOs don't give a damn even about those and continue to disembark even immigrants with Covid despite the prohibitions imposed by the local authorities. In fact, therefore, since yesterday the seizure of large NGO ships has become much more difficult."
26290	5	"The sentence stems from the case that in the summer of 2020 involved the Sea Watch 3 and 4 boats, inspected by the Italian authorities in the ports of Palermo and Porto Empedocle (Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese): irregularities were found during the checks and from there the lock was triggered. Sea Watch 4 had been stranded in Palermo for six months. The German NGO, owner of both ships, had appealed to the TAR of Sicily, arguing that the harbor offices would have violated the 2009 EU directive of 2016 by exceeding the powers of the port state. The Tar had therefore turned to the EU Court of Justice, which established that the directive should be interpreted on the basis of the rules of international law starting from the Convention on the law of the sea, which establishes the ""obligation to rescue people in danger"". The comment of the managers of Sea Watch was immediate: «It is a victory. Ships will be able to continue doing what they know and must do: rescuing people, and not getting stuck in port for arbitrary and specious decisions. The arbitrary checks - the NGO reiterated - must end"". Making the ruling even more questionable is the fact that only once the migrants have landed will the port State be able to start inspecting the vessel and complying with the safety rules at sea. Then what should be obvious is underlined, but which in reality is not: in the event that the inspection detects irregularities, the State can take the actions it deems necessary, provided that they are ""adequate and proportionate"", and if a ship flies foreign flag the principle of sincere cooperation between the two countries is in force, which must collaborate and coordinate on the basis of their respective powers."
26291	3	"Cyber ​​attacks against Taiwanese government sites, Chinese military ships and aircraft crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait, i.e. the line that ideally divides the island from the mainland, and exercises that continue to keep Taipei apprehensive. Two days after Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Beijing's ""revenge"" continues, after announcing ""serious consequences""."
26291	5	"The serious consequences materialized with massive military maneuvers in six maritime areas, which later became seven, near what the Dragon considers a ""rebel province"". In the last few hours, the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan has released a note in which it informed that military vehicles of the Chinese armed forces have once again crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, speaking of a ""highly provocative"" maneuver."
26291	7	"""Until 11:00, successive waves of Chinese airplanes and warships conducted exercises in the Taiwan Strait and crossed the median line of the Strait,"" the ministerial note reads. Taiwanese defense analysts believe that the vast military exercises undertaken by Beijing could constitute the dress rehearsal of an armed blockade of the island. Others hypothesize a far more complicated invasion."
26291	9	Cyber ​​attacks against Taipei
26291	10	In addition to the aforementioned Chinese military exercises, Taiwan has to contend with multiple cyberattacks against its government websites. According to reports from the South China Morning Post, in the early hours of Friday 5 August, the websites of the Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs went offline, only to then come back online.
26291	12	Lo Ping-cheng, spokesman for the Taiwanese government, explained that the traffic of cyber attacks detected in recent days from Taipei has been about double the numbers recorded in past attacks. “The peak was on Tuesday, and the attack traffic was 23 times the previous one,” Lo said, adding that the targets of recent cyberattacks on government departments included Taiwan's presidential office and other ministries.
26291	14	However, the island's authorities have reassured the population by letting it be known that they have launched a response mechanism to strengthen the protection of the sites. At the moment there would have been no security risks for confidential information. Obviously the attacks have not been claimed, but in Taipei the feeling is that they are part of the Chinese reaction to Pelosi's visit.
26291	16	Military exercises and diplomatic protests
26291	17	On the first day of the exercises, the Chinese army launched at least 11 Dongfeng missiles in the direction of Taiwan, in the waters around the northeast and southwest coasts of the island. Beijing has also sent hundreds of fighters and bombers to the area.
26291	19	The Chinese public broadcaster CCTV, quoting Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the National Defense University, explained that nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier formation of Chinese forces were also taking part in the aforementioned maneuvers. However, it is not clear whether Liaoning and Shandong, the two aircraft carriers available to China, are actually taking part in the exercises. The locations of the two ships were not and are not known.
26291	21	On the second day of the exercises, on Friday 5 August, the Chinese news agency Xinhua highlighted the use of drones by the Chinese military. Drones have been used to capture images of rockets precisely hitting targets located in the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, Japan said on Thursday, August 4, two unmanned aerial vehicles - identified as a BZK-005 reconnaissance drone and a TB-001 reconnaissance attack drone - headed towards the East China Sea.
26292	3	Unprecedented military exercises. Flown over the island several times. Bombs also on Japanese waters
26292	5	"At 12 local time yesterday, China kicked off the largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan, which eventually even spilled over into Japanese waters. They are the response to the visit to the island by the Speaker of the American House Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi assured that her presence made it ""unequivocally clear"" that the US ""would not abandon"" a democratic ally like Taiwan. Her trip sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which promised ""punishments"". A showdown, as tensions continue to grow in the region: yesterday a total of 22 Chinese fighter jets briefly passed the informal median line dividing the Taiwan Strait. The Ministry of Defense of Taipei, has detected eight J-11, twelve Su-30 and two J-16, and specified that, according to the protocol, it had «activated the air defense systems, made the jets take off and launched messages of warning"". The official Chinese media recall that these are ""large-scale military and training maneuvers"" which include live launches of artillery shells and missiles in six maritime areas off-limits to navigation and overflights. The maneuvers have also been extended from Sunday 7 August to Monday 8 until 10 am."
26292	7	"The Global Times, an English-language newspaper close to the Beijing regime, said, quoting various military analysts, that the maneuvers are ""unprecedented"" and that the missiles would have flown over Taiwan for the first time. The fiery words of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi came as confirmation. ""It is the United States that has caused the troubles, the crisis and that continue to increase tensions,"" he specified. And he harshly replied to the joint G7 communiqué which on Wednesday asked Beijing to avoid ""aggressive military activity"" due to the risk of ""an unnecessary escalation"" and ""not to unilaterally change the status quo by force"". The blatant US provocation, with Pelosi's visit to Taipei, ""has created a bad precedent if it is not corrected and opposed"", added Wang. Beijing's Foreign Ministry then summoned the ambassadors of the G7 countries, including Italy, and of the EU to ""express their complete disappointment"" at the communiqué signed by the heads of diplomacy who strongly criticize its military exercises."
26292	9	"China has therefore placed the blame for the escalation on the US and its allies. While the Taipei Defense Ministry explained its position as follows: ""We will support the principle of preparing for war without seeking war."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he is attending the ASEAN summit. “The United States opposes any unilateral effort to change the status quo in Taiwan, especially by force. US policy on the island has not changed», he reiterated and underlined that «the stability of the strait is in the interest of the entire region». Then it was the turn of Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov: ""The tension in the region around Taiwan was caused artificially."" We - he continued - understand perfectly who caused it: the visit of Nancy Pelosi. It was completely unnecessary and an unnecessary provocation."""
26292	11	"On the ground, the situation is becoming increasingly heated. Journalists from the AFP news agency observed shells fired by the Chinese army in the direction of the Taiwan Strait. The reporters were on the Chinese island of Pingtan, a few kilometers from the ongoing maneuvers, and according to their testimony the howitzers were fired from sites near military installations. And to make matters worse, five ballistic missiles fired by the People's Liberation Army have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone. Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi specified that it was the first episode of its kind: ""This is a serious matter that concerns the national security of our country and the safety of people,"" he underlined. Tokyo has also filed a diplomatic protest with the Chinese government."
26293	1	Sustainable finance and EU taxonomy: what changes?
26293	3	The EU Taxonomy changes sustainable finance. Let's see how
26293	5	At the beginning of July, the European Parliament promoted the Sustainability Taxonomy introduced by the European Commission led by Ursula von der Leyen, approving it by majority vote. With this move, the Strasbourg hemicycle brought about the entry into force of a proposal which aims to draw a clear line. Consequently, giving a definitive picture of what is considered functional to the sustainable development of the Old Continent and what instead does not belong to this ambit in the economic activities promoted within the Old Continent. This also has major impacts on sustainable finance, a field in which Brussels wants to play a leading role.
26293	7	"The impact will be significant, in particular, in guaranteeing companies and financial institutions that promote the issuance of sustainable bonds, ""green"" products and financial statements dedicated to ESG criteria an increasing degree of uniformity. The will to strengthen two European plans linked to the field of sustainable finance emerges from the Taxonomy: on the one hand, the Action Plan for sustainable finance; on the other, the complementary Regulation on the dissemination of sustainable finance, which aims to promote a growing level of transparency. Since last July 6, the day of approval, only economic activities that openly contribute to one or more of the six environmental objectives indicated have been defined in an unambiguous and unequivocal form as sustainable. These are: climate change mitigation of the economic system; adaptation of strategic sectors to climate change; protection of marine and water resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention; protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems."
26293	9	"Now, the greatest burden for operators will be to understand how to optimize reporting on the subject. In Italy, the Forum for Sustainable Finance has taken a position since the beginning of the reform process on the ground of the new Taxonomy and ""carefully monitors the progressive development of the European Taxonomy, which represents a valid tool for the classification of sustainable investments under the banner of greater transparency and disclosure. An important provision which, however, will be able to unfold its positive potential if it takes into consideration the constraints and increases the opportunities of sustainable finance"", said the Secretary General of the Forum, Francesco Bicciato."
26293	11	"In the recent study EU Taxonomy and other regulations on sustainable finance: implications for financial operators, the Forum for Sustainable Finance underlined that, from this point of view, it is the need to possess ""clear and consistent data"" that makes the difference to allow to an enterprise an accurate account of its activities. Certainly, in this sense, it will be necessary to maintain the current level of discrepancy in the obligations imposed on each company in relation to sustainability: on the initiative of the Eurodeputy of Fratelli d'Italia Raffaele Stancanelli last spring the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (Csdd) directive with which the EU wants to complete the set of policies aimed at regulating the energy transition agenda to regulate the management of sectors brought under the criteria of environmental, social and governance sustainability, prodomic to the Taxonomy, has been amended to favor small and medium enterprises. The CSDD essentially provides for various levels of obligation for companies to report the activities of the sustainability report which will be more stringent only for companies with at least 500 employees and a turnover of 140 million euros."
26293	13	"By doing so, the nature of the Taxonomy is better delineated and, above all, the strongest link is offered to bind, in a substantial form, transparency on sustainability and financial transparency, required above all of those companies that focus on ESG criteria to enter the markets of capital. The companies covered by the Taxonomy will have to account for the turnover, capital investments and operating expenses relating to the activities that are part of the Taxonomy and this, notes the study by the Forum for Sustainable Finance, can allow investors to ""analyse companies by account of their environmental impact and decarbonisation projects.Moreover, the greater availability of information will support both the self-assessments of companies with respect to their climate risks and impacts, and the dialogue of investors with investee companies and will allow for greater transparency as to concerns financial instruments that aim to achieve sustainability objectives"". First of all, Green Bonds that can only be issued if they are truly such, therefore clearly defined in terms of objectives and prospects. But from this point of view, Taxonomy can also contribute significantly to the fight against corporate greenwashing. European priority on which Taxonomy today offers an additional support. The match will be complex and companies will certainly have to be attentive to the internal control of the accounts to bring back only what is pertinent to the activities of the Taxonomy. But it represents the first step towards a common standard that is vital to obtain when it comes to sustainable finance and investments on the subject."
26294	1	Engaging the Boomers The climate movement can't just remain a story for kids
26294	2	75 million: is the number of over 60s in the United States. They are more than the entire Italian population, they vote in large numbers and own two-thirds of the country's financial resources. That's why Bill McKibben founded a new movement, called Third Act, aimed at mobilizing the elderly
26294	4	"Okay, boomers? We could translate the idea like this: overturning the most abused meme phrase in the history of social networks, because the fight against climate change also needs the elderly, the baby boomer generation and the next one, the ""silent generation"". The ideologue and organizer of this enlarging of the list is a 61-year-old who has gone through every stage of American environmentalism: the founder of 350.org – an international environmental organization based in New York – Bill McKibben."
26294	6	“I am old enough to remember the first Earth Day, in 1970, the public call for change that led to the first ecological protection laws in the United States and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Then, cyclically, the movement expanded and contracted depending on the context and retained its tendency to relax after a positive cycle. When climate became the central issue, grassroots environmentalism effectively no longer existed, it was recreated anew by a new generation, in Europe and the USA: Sunrise movement, Extinction rebellion, Fridays for future. But that is not enough now, because the structure of resistance to the status quo is too powerful».
26294	8	This is why McKibben, writer, journalist and activist, founded a new movement, called Third Act, explicitly aimed at the mobilization of people over 60. Third Act looks for the right channels and languages ​​to talk to them, to bring them to demonstrations, to make their attention to the climate and the environment visible, adapting activism to the rhythms of the age.
26294	10	«Third act» because the first were the great battles for civil rights in the United States, but in Italy we could speak of 1968, or of the victories in the referendums that changed society in the 1970s: a historical moment in which it was common for people to participate in public life around them. The second act was the return to the private sphere, the surrender to the consumer society of the 80s and 90s, the end of history translated on an individual scale. The third, for that boomer or silent generation, must be the moment of the political legacy, according to McKibben: facing together with the grandchildren to create the critical social and electoral mass necessary to fight against climate change.
26294	12	"The key number, according to McKibben, is 75 million. There are many people over 60 in the United States. “They are more than all the population of France. And they vote in large numbers: in 2020 they were 44% of all those who went to the polls. They also own two-thirds of this country's financial resources, versus five percent for millennials. It means that I am a piece of society that both Washington and Wall Street are forced to listen to when it mobilizes: they have the resources, they have the strength, they have the time to do it and very often they also have grandchildren, and they are increasingly worry about them."""
26294	14	"In short, the climate movement must stop being just a story of kids, also because, as McKibben says, ""it is morally unacceptable to leave the weight of such an important battle alone on their shoulders""."
26294	16	America travels towards midterm elections, climate action is blocked in Congress by the non-majority of Democrats on environmental issues, because Senator Joe Manchin votes with Republicans on this issue, and is also stalled on the executive floor by Supreme Court ruling, which gave a very limited interpretation on the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency.
26295	3	Russia's aggressiveness is alarming the Scandinavian island, in search of greater security just like Sweden and Finland. For Brussels it would be a strategic outpost between the Atlantic and the North Sea, an area where it lost influence after Brexit
26295	5	Icelanders are increasingly looking to the European Union with greater interest. This is testified by a survey carried out by the opinion poll institute Gallup according to which 47% of citizens are in favor of joining the European Union, the highest figure in the last 12 years, while 33% are against. Sympathy for Brussels has grown over time: in 2010 only 26% of Icelanders wanted to join while in 2014 the figure had grown to 37%.
26295	7	The acceleration in recent months is linked to the Ukrainian crisis and the search for greater security with belonging to the community bloc. The same happened to Finland and Sweden, which applied for NATO membership. Iceland is already part of the Atlantic Alliance and has followed a parallel path.
26295	9	The benefits of a possible Icelandic membership, for Brussels, are not linked to the energy sector, that is, to one of the most delicate issues in the Ukrainian dossier. Reykjavik has reserves of natural gas and oil and therefore could not increase the community reserves, favoring a reduction of dependence on Russia.
26295	11	What makes Iceland strategic is its position, crucial for controlling the sea routes that guarantee access to the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. The frictions between the West and Russia have given new importance to that part of the world, forgotten after the end of the Cold War. Moscow intends to exploit it to expand the range of action of its naval and submarine fleet while the European Union has lost ground after Brexit.
26295	13	Furthermore, relations between Iceland and Russia worsened after Reykjavik's choice to join the European Union's sanctions against Moscow.
26295	15	Iceland is deeply integrated with the Union because it is part of the European Economic Area, the Schengen Area, participates without the right to vote in some programs and agencies and consults with the Union on foreign policy matters, frequently aligning with the positions expressed by the latter in matters of international affairs and taking part in civilian peacekeeping missions that are established.
26295	17	In July 2009, after a financial crisis and snap elections, Iceland applied to become a member of the European Union for the first time. The consultations had produced changes in government with the alternation between the conservatives of the Independence Party and the pro-Europeans of the Social Democratic Alliance.
26295	19	Membership of the Union was seen as a way to end the crisis by adopting the euro and as a logical choice to have more decision-making power in European politics.
26295	21	The scenario, however, changed rapidly. Iceland recovered quickly from the crisis while the Union sank into it, also complicating bilateral relations.
26295	23	"The 2013 general elections ended with the victory of the Progressive Party (which despite its name is a centre-right political force) and the Independence Party. Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson said that ""the government would stop negotiations between Iceland and the European Union and that the latter would not resume until a referendum is held""."
26295	25	The Progressive Party was against the negotiations because it feared that union membership would undermine Reykjavik's control of fishing stocks. Iceland has one of the most modern and productive fishing industries in the world and to maintain sustainable fish stocks and protect the marine ecosystem, annual quotas are set which impose an upper limit on activities in this sector.
26295	27	"The Ministry of Fisheries, as recalled by the BBC in 2016, is the most important department of the Icelandic government and the then Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson explained that ""he would never have chosen to join the European Union"" because, in this way, ""the 'Iceland shouldn't have shared decisions in the fisheries sector with 27 or 28 other countries, making everything more complicated' and giving up the quota system, not envisaged by community policy."
26295	29	In 2015, the application to join the European Union was withdrawn. The 2017 consultations ended with the election of a Parliament made up of two-thirds by Eurosceptic deputies and with the formation of a grand coalition government led by Katrin Jakobsdottir, of the Red-Green Movement, hostile towards the European Union. The executive was then reconfirmed after the 2021 elections.
26295	31	In March of this year, with the invasion of Ukraine having begun a few days ago, fourteen deputies submitted to Parliament a bill which provides for the convening of a national referendum, which should take place by the end of the year, to ask the population whether Iceland should restart accession negotiations with the European Union.
26295	33	Prime Minister Jakobsdottir has shown little enthusiasm for this development by declaring that a referendum can only take place when the majority of MPs are in favor and that at the moment Iceland should not force its hand to join the European Union.
26295	35	The problem, also highlighted by Jakobsdottir, is that the majority of Parliament, which has 63 seats, is not in favor of the referendum but only the Social Democrats, the Liberal Party and the Pirate Party are.
26297	3	Globalization, as we know it, is bound to change first with the pandemic and then with the Russian war in Ukraine. From changes in supply chains to raw material supply chains
26297	5	The Covid-19 pandemic, the serious disruptions in maritime transport (such as the case of the Ever Given ship stranded in the Suez Canal or the container ships stopped due to the war in Ukraine), the resurgence of populist nationalisms and the growing tensions between China and all of its major trading partners, have led pundits to proclaim the death of globalization. However, what lies ahead is not a less globalized world.
26297	7	"The advent of the Coronavirus has demonstrated more than other events the fragility of the global supply chains of raw materials and has substantially accelerated the so-called ""deglobalization"" trend, a term which technically means ""overcoming globalization by stimulating local markets ”."
26297	9	Deglobalization, a slowbalisation
26297	10	Deglobalization therefore should not be understood as something extreme, a deflagration of the globalization that has characterized the world economy for 40 years, but rather as what the Economist has defined as slowbalisation, i.e. a slowdown in the trends of economic-financial integration between countries.
26297	12	Instead of receding, globalization is taking a form largely unknown even to analysts.
26297	14	"«In just over three decades, millions of families around the world have been able to buy cars and televisions, clothes and air conditioners for the first time. Many of these consumer goods are mainly produced by factories with ""low cost"" labor in Asian countries which, however, use resources (raw materials) from other countries: this is the type of activity we think of when we talk about of ""globalisation"". As production has shifted from Europe, North America and Japan to China, Vietnam and Indonesia, the prices of many consumer goods are now lower than they were at the turn of the century,” explained Mohamed EL-Erian, president of Queen's College of London, who gave the International Monetary Fund a conference entitled ""Navigating the New Normal in Industrial Countries""."
26297	16	To decree the beginning of deglobalization is therefore the disappearance of these tendencies that have supported globalization. In North America, Europe and Asia, populations are growing slowly – or decreasing – and aging rapidly. In almost all middle- and high-income countries fewer new families are formed and older ones buy fewer goods and are more inclined to spend on travel and holidays.
26297	18	Efficiency vs resilience
26297	19	"The pandemic was only the latest - albeit the most impactful - in a series of adverse events to the globalized model. There are obvious geopolitical issues, not least of which is the war in Ukraine. But at the heart of deglobalization are the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States and, in general, the relationship of dependence (including Europe) that has been established with China, the ""world factory"" par excellence: «In addition to these difficulties of economic policy, then there is the issue of energy, which not only translates into the growth of bills for private citizens, but has important consequences on the production and costs of companies. Furthermore, we tend to forget how supply chain disruptions attributable to natural disasters, caused by the climate crisis, lead to billions of dollars in losses in the form of production shutdowns and lost revenues,” writes Marc Levinson, economist and historian of Economist and Independent which has just published the book “The Box” on the subject. This is due to the complexity behind the supply chains, for which the managers themselves find it difficult to monitor developments, if not in certain cases, to have full knowledge of them, resulting in a lack of preparation in terms of risk management, i.e. risk management."
26297	21	The role of technology in deglobalization: no, it's not what you think
26297	22	Even technology - it seems a paradox, but you will see that it is not - is driving deglobalization, because it limits trade. An example was provided by the economist Marc Levinson in an article in the penultimate May issue of the Economist: «In 2021 all car manufacturers have announced major investments in electric cars. Perhaps - he writes - this is wonderful news for the environment, but it will have a negative and in many cases fatal impact on the tens of thousands of companies that are part of the supply chains of the car manufacturers: the average electric vehicle involves several thousand less than an internal combustion vehicle of similar size.' But there is not only this case, rather reported by the newspapers also in Italy: consumers, all over the world, no longer need stereo systems - an increasingly niche market - when they can buy streaming music services on their smartphones. As for businesses, in many countries more than a fifth of investment is currently spent on research, software and other intangible expenditure rather than machinery and equipment. Upgrading industrial facilities often means downloading software rather than replacing hardware, which further hurts factory sales. Innovations such as cloud computing allow companies to share computers just as bike sharing allows people to share bicycles, limiting the overall demand for these types of physical goods.
26297	24	"Reshoring, or the ""big return"""
26297	25	"A passage in the essay by Professor Mohamed EL-Erian provides an effective synthesis of how globalization is changing by ""slipping"" towards ""deglobalization"": «World production is becoming progressively less important for the global economy, also for this reason we are witnessing a phenomenon of reduction of the manpower employed in the factories in those countries - often in South-East Asia - in which the production chains in recent years had been delocalised. Hand in hand with this phenomenon, we are witnessing the exponential growth of automation which eliminates (or attenuates) the few signs of ""reshoring"" of industrial production, from ""low-wage"" Asian countries to ""high-wage"" countries in Europe and North America"". Conversely, EL-Erian believes, there is considerable evidence that manufacturers and retailers are trying to keep risks in check by diversifying their sourcing of key components and finished products, rather than manufacturing everything in giant factories located in Asia. For a multinational company, an export-oriented plant in Mexico or Morocco is likely to complement, rather than replace, a plant in China."
26297	27	So, is globalization really over?
26298	3	The Italian people have never voted for abortion or to have the Democratic Party in government. Yet he finds himself with six million Italian children killed and the Democratic Party in government for ten years. This is the state of liberal 'democracy'.
26298	5	The famous radical referendum for free abortion was rejected by a large majority. The law that was approved provided for abortion only for 'therapeutic' purposes, i.e. in case of risk for mother and child. It was totally rejected. Because Italy had to be emptied before being filled with 'them'.
26298	7	They want genocide by other means. The medium is immigration. First they prepared the field with murderous and criminal laws such as abortion: they created a vacuum and then filled it.
26298	9	The perverts, the cuckolds of hospitality, exalt the 'mestizaje'. Bishops, alleged intellectuals and politicians.
26298	11	It is a genocidal project. The modern equivalent of the Wannsee Conference. Only, this time, the new Nazis, the corrupt ruling elite, are not aiming for the final solution against one people, but against all peoples. No longer through extermination, but through 'mixing'.
26298	13	We are in the presence not of a political project, but of a new religion, unique and global, which no longer aims only at souls, but also at the biological identity of the individual. It does not want to convert, as all monotheistic religions naturally aim to do, but to change the individual on a biological level: so that there can no longer be any resistance to globalization.
26298	15	Their goal, and it can also be seen in the donors of NGOs like Soros, is the creation of a humanity without an identity. A racially indistinct, sexually confused 'brown' mass and therefore intellectually incapable of rebelling. But beware: they, the elite, will not mix. They will remain racially pure and dominate, as has been the case in South America for centuries, a global mulatto society.
26298	17	They must be stopped. All peoples must rebel against this Final Solution. It is not a simple political battle, it is a war to the death for our existence.
26299	3	German media: It is already obvious that Russia is building a new world order
26299	5	Russia, Turkey and Iran are trying to expand their influence on the planet. Over the past five years, the leaders of these countries have repeatedly met in tripartite meetings and discussed various issues. A recent similar summit in Tehran is a clear confirmation of the intensification of cooperation between them, writes the German newspaper Handelsblatt.
26299	6	“The signal from these negotiations was clear: Western countries are gaining rivals and losing influence on serious geopolitical issues,” the author convinces.
26299	7	Demirjan stressed that Russia, represented by President Vladimir Putin, is actively creating a new world order, while the West watches helplessly and cannot drag it into international isolation.
26299	9	Thus, the observer noted that, despite the sanctions, Tehran has recently been actively expanding its international network of contacts, and Ankara is playing an increasingly important role in negotiations for the resolution of major crises.
26299	11	The journalist noted that the heads of Western states have become addicted to countries that they did not pay attention to before.
26299	13	“The unity displayed during the meeting was more than a political public relations stunt. The West shouldn't underestimate that,” she said.
26299	14	Moscow, Tehran and Ankara do not have the same interests on some issues, but at the meeting the presidents discussed cooperation more and tried to find ways to solve the problems. Therefore, the Russian Federation and Iran signed a $40 billion gas deal.
26299	15	Beyond that, the Iranians have voiced their support for the Russian NVO in Ukraine.
26299	17	At the same time, Turkey and Iran want to quadruple their trade turnover, including through oil and gas deals. Ankara also expects that in the future it will be able to pay for gas supplies in Russian rubles and Turkish lira, without using the US dollar and the EU euro. Real progress has also been made in the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea at a time when European industry is afraid to face the coming winter without gas from the Russian Federation. The EU is dependent on Russian energy supplies, with Western sanctions having little effect on the Russian economy.
26299	19	The Tehran summit demonstrated true unity, not PR Action politics fit for the camera. Therefore, the West must understand that not all states of the world have the same attitude towards what is happening, for example, in Ukraine. In particular, the majority of the Turkish population is sure that the responsibility for unleashing this conflict lies with NATO.
26299	21	This approach is valid not only in relation to the Russian Federation. Even the sanctions imposed on Iran are not enough as Tehran continues to work on its nuclear program. With its sanctions, the West only causes hatred towards itself.
263	3	Rome, 22 April – Fewer and fewer people are worried about the climate, at least according to Istat data. News that will perhaps make Greta Thumberg cry. But you know, in the show business that information is today, fashions come and go.
263	4	According to Istat's Report on Equitable and Sustainable Wellbeing (Bes), in the two-year period 2020-2021 there was a trend reversal in all of Italy with respect to concern about climate change. Until 2019, the percentage of people, aged 14 and over, who believed that climate change and the increase in the greenhouse effect were the main environmental problems, was growing. In recent years this percentage has increased from 71% to 66.5% in 2021.
263	5	While on the one hand these numbers remain significant, on the other such a decrease cannot go unnoticed. Especially since in recent years the propaganda on this issue has been nothing short of pounding. Greta Thumberg was certainly a symbol of mainstream and somewhat easy-going attention to environmental issues. The little Swedish activist had become a global media phenomenon, while today she seems to have disappeared from the scene. In these times of spectacularization of politics and information, news also has its life cycle. The battles of opinion that previously seemed very important quickly give way to something else. A succession of waves, in which a single topic tyrannizes and cannibalizes everyone's attention and then ends up in oblivion. Thus environmentalism had to give way to increasingly burning issues. First Covid, today the war in Ukraine, tomorrow who knows.
263	6	A cold shower for all those who believed that the green economy was the battle of the future or for those who had a Greta Thumberg poster in their room. On the contrary, the more or less successful attempts of the so-called green washing remain from an entire environmentalist season, i.e. all those ways by companies to grab new market shares by giving themselves a more ecological image.
2630	1	The coup de grace to the Covid narrative
2630	3	COVID Update: What's the truth?
2630	5	The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most manipulated infectious disease events in history, characterized by official lies in an endless stream led by government bureaucracies, medical associations, medical boards, media and international agencies. We have witnessed a long list of unprecedented intrusions into medical practice, including attacks on medical experts, the destruction of medical careers among doctors who refuse to participate in the killing of their patients, and massive regimentation of health care, led by individuals unskilled with enormous wealth, power and influence.
2630	7	For the first time in American history a president, governors, mayors, hospital administrators and federal bureaucrats are determining medical treatments based not on scientifically based or even experiential accurate information, but rather to coerce acceptance of special forms of care and “prevention,” including remdesivir, the use of respirators, and finally, a series of essentially untested messenger RNA vaccines. For the first time in the history of medical treatment, protocols are being formulated not based on the experience of physicians who successfully treat the largest number of patients, but rather individuals and bureaucracies who have never treated a single patient, including Anthony Fauci , Bill Gates, EcoHealth Alliance, CDC, WHO, state public health officials and hospital administrators.
2630	9	The media (TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.), medical societies, state medical commissions, and social media owners have self-appointed themselves as the sole source of information about this so-called “pandemic.” Websites have been taken down, highly accredited and experienced clinical physicians and experts in the field of infectious diseases have been demonized, careers have been destroyed, and all dissenting information has been labeled “misinformation” and “dangerous lies,” even if it comes from by leading experts in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, pulmonary intensive care and epidemiology. These truth blackouts occur even when this information is supported by extensive scientific citations from some of the world's most qualified medical specialists. Incredibly, even individuals, such as Dr. Michael Yeadon, a retired former chief scientist and vice president of science at the UK pharmaceutical company Pfizer, who accused the company of producing an extremely dangerous vaccine, are being ignored and demonized. Furthermore, he, along with other highly qualified scientists, has stated that no one should receive this vaccine.
2630	11	Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most cited experts in his field, who has successfully treated over 2000 COVID patients using an early treatment protocol (which the so-called experts have completely ignored), has come under a particularly vicious assault from those who financially benefit from vaccines. He has published his findings in peer reviewed journals, reporting an 80% reduction in hospitalizations and a 75% reduction in deaths using early treatment. Despite this, he is under an unrelenting series of attacks from information controllers, none of which have treated a single patient.
2630	13	Neither Anthony Fauci, the CDC, WHO nor any government medical institution has ever offered any early treatment other than Tylenol (acetaminophen aka Tachipirina), hydration and calling an ambulance once you have difficulty breathing. This is unprecedented in the entire history of medical care as early treatment of infections is critical to saving lives and preventing serious complications. Not only have these medical organizations and federal lapdogs not even suggested early treatment, but they have attacked anyone who attempts to initiate such treatment with every weapon at their disposal: loss of license, removal of hospital privileges, shaming, destruction of reputation, and even arrest.
26301	2	"Lieutenant Commander of Defense Chemical, Biological Radiation Protection Forces: ""The impression is that the pandemic is artificially augmented with new variants released in one region or another"""
26301	4	"AGI - The Russian army believes that the United States may be behind Covid-19 and monkeypox. This was stated at a press conference by the lieutenant commander of the chemical-biological radiation protection forces of the Moscow Defense, Igor Kirillov. After having premised ""the US administration's interest in the study of 'narrow target' biological agents"", Kirillov stated that Washington's possible involvement is suggested by the ""diversity of genetic variants not characteristic for most coronaviruses causing different peaks of incidence, significant differences in mortality and contagiousness, uneven geographical distribution, as well as the unpredictable nature of the epidemic process in general."
26301	7	"There is the impression that, despite efforts to contain the infection and isolate patients, the pandemic is artificially boosted with new variants released in one region or another, Kirillov said again, ""we are analyzing the possible involvement of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the emergence of the new coronavirus."
26301	9	"The agency has funded Program Predict, which has been studying novel coronaviruses and harvesting bats carrying coronaviruses since 2009. Metabiota, a company known for its military-biological activity in Ukraine, is listed among the project contractors."""
26301	11	"Another US company was studying the monkeypox virus, the official said. ""So, we're seeing a clear trend: Pathogens that cause infectious diseases and command attention from the Pentagon develop as pandemics, while US pharmaceutical companies and their sponsors, the leaders of the US Democratic Party, are the beneficiaries,” concluded Kirillov."
26302	1	Estonia: Government decides to remove all Soviet monuments from public spaces
26302	2	"The head of government specified that ""their number is between 200 and 400"""
26303	2	According to the broadcaster, several G7 officials have traveled to various parts of the world to try to form a network of nations ready to hit Moscow economically, but without finding the support they expected
26303	4	"Efforts by the US and the G7 to gain the greatest possible international support for Ukraine are not having success. The broadcaster ""Bloomberg"" writes it, highlighting how many of the G20 countries have not joined the sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. According to ""Bloomberg"", several G7 officials have traveled to various parts of the world to try to form a network of nations ready to hit Moscow economically, without however finding the membership they expected. “It is an uncomfortable reality facing Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his extended trip to Southeast Asia and Africa: Much of the world is not ready to follow US and European efforts to isolate President Vladimir Putin's Russia ”, according to the broadcaster. This makes it all the more difficult to reach agreement on global initiatives such as a ceiling on Russian oil prices as proposed by the G7, encouraging Putin and his main supporter, Chinese President Xi Jinping, to pursue their respective global agendas. China is a major factor in this dynamic: Beijing's spending on Russian oil has soared since the war broke out: it spent 72 percent more on Russian energy purchases in June than a year earlier. In this context, continues ""Bloomberg"", China's rivalry with the United States also has an obvious weight, with tensions that have increased this week due to the visit of the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei."
2634	3	Conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that he has given orders to the navy to patrol the English Channel to curb the surge in landings of illegal immigrants.
2634	5	A choice that confirms, if there were any doubts, the effective applicability of the naval blockade. A solution repeatedly invoked by the Brothers of Italy: “The announcement of the conservative premier Boris Johnson – commented Giorgia Meloni – once again denies the lie of the left according to which illegal immigration would be impossible to stop. As always supported by Fratelli d'Italia, blocking departures and illegal immigration is possible: all you need to do is want it. Will Lamorgese and company ever understand it?”.
2634	7	“If the FdI proposes it, it is an act of war, if instead Great Britain does it, it is a legitimate act. – Senator FdI Alberto Balboni pressed – Now what will the beautiful souls of the immigrationist left say? If Johnson does it, Italy can do it too ”.
2634	9	"In recent days, the FdI leader himself had once again asked for Lamorgese's resignation: ""In all these years - he underlined - we have never seen a single initiative of his to try to stop illegal immigration to Italy, with landings that are increasing day by day. Dear Minister, if you do not have the intention (or the ability) to defend our borders, remember that no one is forcing you to stay at the Viminale ”."
2635	3	With thousands of landings and arrivals by plane, the spread of Afro-Asian viruses is inevitable. If we then put this together with the moral decadence that leads a hyperactive minority to multiple anal intercourse, with the excited consent of the system, we have yet another contagion alarm. Then they celebrate the day against 'homotransbiphobia', they should stop doing certain things instead.
2635	5	"“Currently, cases of monkeypox have been reported in Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy, so far mostly in young males who have sex with males. The ECDC, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, has activated a European-level alert system in which the Higher Institute of Health participates. Furthermore, the ISS has set up a task force composed of experts in the sector and has contacted the sentinel networks of the centers for sexually transmitted infections in order to continuously monitor the national situation"". The Higher Institute of Health underlines this in a note."
2635	7	"The recommendations provide for ""to stay at home and rest if a fever arises and to contact your doctor in the event of the appearance of blisters or other skin manifestations - continue the ISS experts - As prevention, it is important to avoid contact with people with fever and carefully evaluate, before any close personal contact or sexual contact, the presence of any unusual skin manifestations (such as blisters or other lesions) on the partner's skin. This behavior is helpful in preventing not only monkeypox, but other sexually transmitted infections as well.”"
2635	9	"""It is an infection caused by a virus of the same smallpox family, but which largely differs from the smallpox itself due to its lower diffusivity and severity - explains the ISS - It is widespread in particular among primates and small rodents, mainly in Africa. The infection is transmitted from animals to humans through the animal's saliva and other fluids, or by direct contact with the animal. In humans it presents with fever, muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, tiredness and skin manifestations such as vesicles, pustules, small crusts. It can be transmitted from human to human through 'droplets', contact with body fluids or with skin lesions""."
2635	11	"It is possible that people who have not been vaccinated against smallpox (vaccination abolished in Italy in 1981) ""are at greater risk of infection with monkeypox due to the absence of antibodies which, due to the similarity of the smallpox virus with monkeypox , can also be effective in counteracting this virus”, underline the ISS specialists."
2635	13	It is certainly no coincidence that the first 'Italian' case of monkeypox is a person who arrived from the Canary Islands: islands of massive landings of Africans. Like Lampedusa.
2635	15	All these viruses and diseases spread 'thanks' to globalisation. There is an excessively fast circulation of men from one point of the globe to another: what happens is like the 'fever of the system', a symptom of a disease, globalization.
2635	17	The first case of monkeypox in Italy has been identified at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome. It is a man who returned after a stay in the Canary Islands who presented himself in the emergency room.
2635	19	"Spallanzani explains that the ""clinical picture was characteristic and the monkeypox virus was rapidly identified with molecular techniques and gene dissequencing from the samples of the skin lesions"". The person, continues the hospital, ""is currently hospitalized in isolation in fair general conditions"" and ""epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are underway""."
2635	21	It is not strange that these are the Canary Islands, a massive landing area for Africans.
2637	3	The North Atlantic media are engaged in an unprecedented information war. This is characterized by an incessant erosion of the distinction between facts and the manipulation of emotions and perceptions, between conjectures and unassailable truths.
2637	4	I witnessed this type of information warfare firsthand in the United States during the final years of the Vietnam War and leading up to the Iraq War, both wars driven by political hoaxes that resulted in numerous war crimes.
2637	6	The manipulation of news about Russia's war on Ukraine is intended to prevent the public from seeking lasting peace for both Ukraine and the region. The purpose of this information war is to prolong the war to serve the interests of those who wish to promote it. How does one know what constitutes fact and what constitutes lying, and how does one learn to explain events without being accused of justification?
2637	7	Causes leading to war
2637	8	To demonize your enemies, you must first dehumanize them. They must be defined as those who acted criminally and without provocation. I personally wholeheartedly condemned the illegal invasion of Ukraine, but I am still interested in how we got to this point.
2637	9	"Stephen Cohen's 2019 book ""War with Russia""? provides an in-depth analysis of US-Russian relations since the end of the Soviet Union and the dynamics of these relations with Ukraine since 2013. Cohen views the conflict in Ukraine as a “proxy war,” but one that has involved “ too many American and Russian trainers, assistants and perhaps fighters”. He reminds us of the war in Georgia (2008) and in Syria (2011/2020). “The risk of direct conflict” between the United States and Russia “continues to grow in Ukraine,” Cohen wrote in his 2019 book."
2637	11	Democracies and autocracies
2637	13	"The US government sees the world as divided into democracies and autocracies. Governments deemed hostile by Washington are called autocracies. For the Summit for Democracy, held in December 2021, the United States, for example, did not invite Bolivia, even though the country had recently gone through the electoral process; meanwhile, the United States has invited Pakistan, the Philippines and Ukraine, even though the US government has said it has doubts about these states (in the case of Ukraine, just a few months earlier, the Pandora Papers revealed the depth of corruption among the Ukrainian elite, which includedPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy). As Ukraine represents the struggle of ""democracy"" against ""Russian autocracy"", Zelenskyy was invited to the summit. The concept of ""democracy"" is stripped of much of its political content and is being weaponized to promote governmental changes beneficial to US global interests."
2637	15	Real and fabricated threats to justify war
2637	17	While Russian President Vladimir Putin's exaggerated claims about the threat of Nazism in Ukraine that he is using to try to justify his illegal invasion of Ukraine are unlikely, it is worth examining far-right paramilitary elements and their recruitment of foreign fighters. that have pervaded Ukraine. It is not unthinkable that the arming and financing by Europe and the United States of democracy-oriented Ukrainian forces, even if this aid is not officially directed to known far-right extremist militias in Ukraine, could still lead to bloody clashes. There is a risk that far-right extremists could gain a foothold, even those not confined to Ukraine alone.
2637	18	In a 1998 interview with L'Obs, formerly known as “Le Nouvel Observateur,” Zbigniew Brzeziński, former US President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said that in 1979 the United States “consciously increased the likelihood” that the USSR would invade Afghanistan, hoping to give the former Soviet Union “its war in Vietnam”. Similarly, in February 2022, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that she hoped the US would do to Russia in Ukraine what it did to Russia in Afghanistan.
2637	20	"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this war ""could last for a long time, many months, even years,"" which should have set off alarm bells among Europe's political leaders. The consequences of a second Vietnam-style war by Russia could be disastrous for both Ukraine and Europe. Russia, which is part of Europe, will not be a threat to Europe unless Europe becomes a huge US military base. Therefore, NATO expansion is the real threat to Europe."
2637	22	Double standards for joining the international pact
2637	24	Transformed into a mere sounding board for US strategic choices, the European Union supports Ukraine's right to join NATO as a legitimate expression of universal (and European, but no less universal) values. At the same time, the United States has intensified its integration with Ukraine, as seen in the November 2021 US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership. One wonders whether European leaders are aware that recognition of Ukraine's right to join a military pact like NATO is being denied to other countries by the United States.
2637	26	Even if European leaders are aware that the United States is denying this right to other countries, it will make no difference, given the state of militaristic stupor in which they find themselves. So, for example, when the tiny Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean approved a preliminary security deal with China in 2021, the United States responded immediately and with alarm by sending senior security officials to the region to halt the escalation of security. competition for security in the Pacific .
2637	28	The truth comes too late
2637	30	Information warfare is always based on a mix of selective truths, half-truths and outright lies (called false flags) designed to justify the military actions of those who promote it. I have no doubt that both the Russian and US/Ukrainian sides are waging an information war, although given the level of censorship that is being imposed on people around the world consuming this information, we know even less about that which is happens on the Russian side.
2637	31	Sooner or later the truth will emerge, the tragedy is that it will inevitably be too late. In this troubled beginning of a new century, we have one advantage: the world has lost its innocence.
2637	32	"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, for example, is paying a heavy price for aiding in the truth-finding process. For those who haven't given up thinking for themselves, I recommend the chapter entitled ""Language in Politics,"" in Hannah Arendt's 1972 book Crises of the Republic. With this brilliant reflection on the Pentagon Papers, Arendt offers comprehensive data on the Vietnam War (including many war crimes and many lies), collected on the initiative of Robert McNamara, one of the main actors responsible for that war, who was also secretary of defense under two presidents during that period."
2637	34	Silence
2638	3	At least since 1997, with the entry of the Baltic countries into NATO, the Pentagon had already identified the plan for further rapprochement with the Russian borders, anticipating an inevitable conflict with the Kremlin. Ukraine could only be the last stop. However, between yesterday and today there is a decisive difference that complicates the strategy of the States. Yeltsin's Russia colonized by the West and owned by speculators who had looted the huge state assets of the USSR was a military dwarf. Today the Bear is the largest atomic power.
2638	5	However, the States do not give up, even if, aware of the adversary's war paraphernalia, especially in recent years, the due prudence has peeped out among the military, more than among the politicians.
2638	7	What we want to prevent is the welding between Europe and Asia, the political, economic and commercial unity which, thanks above all to the Chinese Belt and Road (the Silk Road) and the sharing of it by Asian and European countries, does not as supporting actors but as protagonists it would determine the new center of the world economy, open, in a multipolar dimension, to Africa, to all the Americas, to Oceania.
2638	9	What is wanted from the Western Empire, better known as the Empire of Terror and Lies, is the stubborn defense of a unipolar world governed by the United States and its Anglo-Saxon and European provinces. I expressed myself in this way in a booklet 7 years ago. Because even then the sunset of an era of history was felt.
2638	11	"The 2014 coup triggered the war against the Ukrainian people. The Nazis go on a manhunt, particularly if they are of a linguistic minority (not just Russian speakers). They distinguish themselves, appealing to their Nazi hero Bandera, a companion of the Fuhrer, in pogroms, lynchings, sniping, burning opponents alive ... in the complicit silence of the EU and the Italian government ... they go against the ""reds"" of the Crimea...bombard the Donbass (more than 3,000 dead) in the silence not only of the European governments but also of those who flaunt their being pacifists."
2638	13	By the time the Russian armies move, the war unleashed by the Nazis has already claimed 14,000 lives.
2638	15	If one remark can be made to the Russian government it is certainly not that it moved rashly but if anything too late in the face of the crimes of Zelensky and his Nazis.
2638	17	The uncertainties of this war strongly desired by NATO and its accomplices are dramatic because the old world still well in the saddle could prefer nuclear conflict rather than taking a step back and reaching serious negotiations leading to a neutral, sovereign, democratic Ukraine.
2638	19	The insipience of the EU is astounding. The sanctions will be terrifying for the European people, not for the Russians, who in the east have an impact on a much wider market than the European one, with a territory inhabited by billions of people, rich in mineral, energy and food resources. The ridiculous sanctions against Russia have in fact strengthened cooperation between Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan PRC and accelerated efforts for an alternative financial system to the US-ruled Swift. Trade with India is progressing with rubles and rupees. Iran also favors de-dollarization with its own currency. Gold or the Renminbi can now offer themselves as a planetary alternative to the dollar as an international reserve currency or in any case as a reference base currency. The nations that have not shared the sanctions against Russia (4 billion people) will soon be able to opt for a financial system that is not rigid and politically controlled like the current one and therefore be freer in political and commercial relations.
2638	21	In his last public appearance, Foreign Minister Lavrov was precise and unambiguous about the break with the Anglo-Saxon financial systems.
2638	23	This of course will not be without inevitable compromises that will last for decades.
2638	25	And Europe. Let me tell you. Poor Europe, without gas and with scarce food supplies. The German Chancellor, poor star: take everything from me but not Russian gas, from which the Italian colony also benefits. Gas from the United States? With gas tankers? And how many do you need? And the regasifiers? There should be at least fifty of them. And where is the money? Loans from the States? the dollar is now fine. But it won't be tomorrow because the US and NATO have prepared the conditions for a financial catastrophe with a Reset, Pandemic, austerity, a war that will - I think - be much worse than that of 2008-2009.
2638	27	It will be a tragedy for the people. But I believe that this frightening combinatory should be the price to pay - the usual people will say - for the crossing from the unipolar system to the multipolar one...
2639	1	Communist regimes and healthcare dictatorships: same story, same end
2639	3	The health dictatorship will fall exactly as the communist dictatorship fell. It will fall first in a symbolic country (guess which one) and then – for an inexorable domino effect – in all the others. Just as in 1989, the implosion of the USSR also led to the crumbling of its faithful satellites. And there will probably be some symbolic event, such as the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Maybe just for metaphor. Perhaps it will be the wall of lies on which the altars to the god Vax and the churches of his priests were erected. Be that as it may, this will happen. We can predict this with reasonable confidence for one simple reason. And that is for the extraordinary similarities between Communism and Covidism, between Communism and Panvaccinism.
2639	5	"Think about it. In both cases, we are dealing with a form of idolatry for a pseudoscience. Marx was convinced that he had identified the inescapable laws of historical development, precise and ""mathematical"" (in their inversion) such as the law of gravity. Likewise, the covidiots and the ultravaxes believe in a ""science"" (where doubt is banned and debate abhorred) based on criteria that are exactly opposite to those on which real science is based. For the communists, it was never a problem to know ""if"", but only ""when"", there would be the definitive triumph of the proletariat. Similarly, for ultravaxes it has never been a problem to guess ""if"" the vaccine would have favored the advent of herd immunity, but only with ""what"" percentage of vaccinated people."
2639	7	"For the communists, if reality did not match their infallible forecasts, forecasts should not be changed, reality should be adulterated. In the same way, for the covidiots, if the deaths ""from"" covid, at the beginning of the pandemic, were not enough to arouse sufficient fear, the deaths ""with"" covid (perhaps who tested positive after a road accident) had to be counted in the deck. While for ultravaxes, if the infected and hospitalized increase dramatically compared to the messianic expectations of vaccine ""salvation"", then there is a problem of ""numbers"", the ""counts"" must be redone, the ""parameters"" must be changed."
2639	9	"Again, for Communism there was no tolerance for ""dissidents"". They were to be demonized or even eliminated. The same goes for the Covidiots and the Ultravaxes: the dodgers of the viral and vaccine monothought are green mush to be shot with cannons. Or, worse, subhumans to be denied even the universal right to health still guaranteed today to the most vicious vicious (enemies of their own health) and the most ferocious criminals (enemies of the health of others)."
2639	11	"Finally, Communism was by vocation, ""denier"". As far as he could, he denied everything: from the police nature of the regimes behind the curtain to the millions of Stalin's dead. Likewise, the covid sufferers deny the usefulness of the treatments and the ultravaxes deny the existence of side effects."
2639	13	In short, only by using the political and historical category of communism is it possible to decipher and decode the otherwise inexplicable madness of current times. As well as its aberrant variations: such as the suspension of doctors from service, the indiscriminate puncture of minors, the prejudicial hostility to treatment.
2639	15	By a ruthless irony of fate (but perhaps it is not a coincidence), Covid was born in the territory of an ancient communist dictatorship, while the line of obtuse rigor and idiotic fanaticism thrives in our country, above all thanks to a small party of ill-concealed communist tradition (expression of the Minister of Health).
264	3	In the newspeak of the Orwellian Atlanticist colony of the Draghistan sultanate, war is called peace and to obtain it, all you need to do is turn off the radiators and the air conditioning.
264	4	"In fact, the sultan of Draghistan has gone from his already admirable ""you don't get vaccinated, you die and you kill"" to the equally laconic and trenchant ""Do you prefer peace or air conditioning?"". Something that sounds like “turn on the air conditioning and kill a Ukrainian child”. It matters little that even a two-year-old child can notice the lack of logical connection between air conditioning (hence the implicit sanctions aimed at not buying Russian gas) and a negotiation to obtain peace with Russia. Logic would have it that in order to obtain what was called ""peace"" in the paleo-Italian language, it would be advisable to create a climate of relaxation to favor dialogue which can hardly be obtained with sanctions or, even worse, by sending weapons to one of the two factions in conflict. But - evidently - the overseas masters do not want this, and the sultan of the Draghistan colony - together with the chorus of his other European counterparts - obeys regardless of the disastrous economic, social and (hoping it never happens) military consequences. Again in Orwell's school, and as in the case of the previous Covid emergency (or rather ""state of exception""), the State and the press need to generate fear and hatred for an enemy so that, in order to fight him, it will be necessary to obey. Thus, while in the case of Covid the enemy were (and still are by inertia) the ""no-vaxes"", now the enemy is an ""adversary"" country which is such by the will of those in charge. On the other hand, ""Putin is worse than an animal"" according to the very diplomatic and highly trained head of diplomacy of Draghistan - a fine strategist who the world envies us - Luigi di Maio. Against this terrible monster which, according to the narration of the globalist propaganda, one day - getting out of bed - out of boredom decided to invade the neighboring Ukraine, weapons must therefore be sent to bring it down. Obviously, the Constitution of the former Italian Republic counts for nothing except in art. 11 establishes that: ""Italy repudiates war as an instrument of offense to the freedom of other peoples and as a means of settling international disputes"". And obviously woe to anyone who, like Prof. Orsini, wonders why this conflict has come about. Woe to say that the cause may have been the progressive 'encirclement' operated by NATO, the persecution of Russian speakers in Ukraine by neo-Nazi battalions (now portrayed by Western propaganda as peaceful Kantian philosophers) praising the Nazi collaborationist Bandera (who figures even on stamps), or that the ""orange revolution"" was financed by the ""philanthropist"" Soros and his cronies [2] (conspiracy!). Draghistan's propaganda is simple, it is ""for dummies"": ""an evil dictator called Putin has invaded a free, happy and democratic country to kill women and children!""; a bit like for air conditioning and peace."
2641	1	The crisis in Ukraine is not about Ukraine. This concerns Germany
2641	3	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. We are talking about Germany and, in particular, a gas pipeline connecting Germany to Russia, called Nord Stream 2. Washington considers this pipeline a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project to the end. Despite this, Nord Stream 2 has moved on and is now fully operational and ready for use. As soon as the German regulators issue the final certification, gas deliveries will begin.
2641	4	German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean and affordable energy, while Russia will see its gas revenues increase significantly. It's a win-win situation for both parties.
2641	6	The US foreign policy establishment is not satisfied with this development. They don't want Germany to become ever more dependent on Russian gas, because trade builds trust and trust leads to expanded trade. As relations heat up, trade barriers are eliminated, regulations are relaxed, travel and tourism are ramping up, and a new security architecture is put in place.
2641	8	In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no longer a need for US military bases, expensive US-made missile and weapons systems, or NATO. Nor is it necessary to transact energy in US dollars or store US Treasuries to balance accounts. Transactions between trading partners can be done in their own currencies, which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream 2.
2641	10	This is not just a pipeline, but a window into the future, a future in which Europe and Asia unite in a vast free trade area that enhances their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the United States on the sidelines.
2641	11	"The consolidation of relations between Germany and Russia heralds the end of the ""unipolar"" world order that the United States has watched over for the past 75 years. A German-Russian alliance risks precipitating the decline of the superpower that is nearing the brink. This is why Washington is determined to do everything possible to sabotage Nord Stream 2 and keep Germany in its orbit. It's a matter of survival."
2641	12	"This is where Ukraine comes into play. Ukraine is Washington's ""weapon of choice"" to torpedo Nord Stream 2 and drive a wedge between Germany and Russia. The strategy is taken from the first page of the US Foreign Policy Handbook, under the heading: Divide and Conquer. Washington must give the impression that Russia poses a threat to European security. This is the goal."
2641	13	They must prove that Putin is a bloodthirsty, capricious and unreliable aggressor. To this end, the media has been instructed to obsessively repeat over and over again that “Russia plans to invade Ukraine”.
2641	14	"What is left unsaid is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that the United States has invaded or overthrown regimes in more than 50 countries in the same period, and that the United States maintains more than 800 military bases in Worldwide. None of this is reported by the media, indeed, the focus is on the ""evil Putin"" who has gathered about 100,000 soldiers along the Ukrainian border, threatening to plunge all of Europe into a new bloody war."
2641	16	All this hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of producing a crisis which can be used to isolate, demonize and ultimately divide Russia into smaller territorial units. The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany. Check out this excerpt (below) from an article by Michael Hudson in The Unz Review:
2641	18	The only way left for American diplomats to block European purchases is to push Russia into a military response, and then pretend that revenge for that response trumps any purely national economic interests. As Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained during a State Department press conference on Jan. 27: “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not advance.”1 .
2641	20	"It is written in black and white. Biden's team wants to ""push Russia into a military response"" to sabotage Nord Stream 2. This implies there will be some sort of provocation meant to get Putin to send his troops across the border to defend ethnic Russians in the east of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response will be swift and severe. The media will denounce this action as a threat to all of Europe, while world leaders will denounce Putin as the ""new Hitler"". That's Washington's strategy in a nutshell, and all of this staging is orchestrated for one purpose: to make it politically impossible for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to get Nord Stream 2 through the final approval process."
2641	22	"Given what we know of Washington's opposition to Nord Stream 2, readers may wonder why, earlier this year, the Biden administration lobbied Congress not to impose further sanctions on the project. The answer to this question is simple: internal politics. Germany is in the process of decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to fill its energy deficit. Furthermore, the threat of economic sanctions is a ""foil"" for Germans who see it as a sign of foreign meddling. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions? asks the Middle German. ""Washington should mind her business and not meddle in ours."""
2641	24	Then there's this statement from Al Jazeera:
2641	26	” Most Germans support the project, only parts of the elite and the media are against the pipeline…
2641	28	“The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizing the project, the more popular it becomes in German society,” said Stefan Meister, an expert on Russia and Eastern Europe at the German Foreign Relations Council.2.
2641	30	Public opinion therefore strongly supports Nord Stream 2, which helps explain why Washington has opted for a new approach. With sanctions not working, Uncle Sam moved on to Plan B: Create an external threat big enough to force Germany to block the pipeline from opening. Frankly, this strategy smacks of desperation, but one must be impressed by Washington's persistence. They may be down 5 points down the stretch, but they haven't thrown in the towel yet. They will give themselves one last chance and see if they can make progress.
2641	32	"On Monday, President Biden held his first joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The hype that surrounded this event was simply unmatched. It was all orchestrated to create an “atmosphere of crisis” which Biden used to pressure the Chancellor in the direction of US policy. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said that ""the Russian invasion was imminent."" Her comments were followed up by State Department spokesman Nick Price, who said intelligence agencies had given him details of a Russian-backed false flag operation that is expected to take place soon, according to the United States. in eastern Ukraine. The warning of Mr. Price was followed Sunday morning by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said a Russian invasion could happen at any time, possibly ""even tomorrow."" This was only a few days after the Bloomberg News agency published its sensational and totally false headline: ""Russia invades Ukraine""."
2641	34	Can you see the pattern here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to put pressure on the German chancellor, who was oblivious and seemed unaware of the campaign targeting him?
2641	36	As one might expect, the coup de grace was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference, Biden forcefully stated that:
2641	38	“ If Russia invades [...], there will be no more [de] Nord Stream 2. We will put an end to this ”.
2641	39	So now Washington decides Germany's policy???
2641	40	What insufferable arrogance!
2641	42	The German chancellor was stunned by Biden's comments, which were clearly not part of the original script. Despite this, Scholz has never agreed to cancel Nord Stream 2 and has even refused to mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could force the leader of the world's third-largest economy to corner him in a public forum, he was wrong. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream 2, regardless of potential tensions in distant Ukraine. But that could change at any time.
2641	43	"After all, who knows what incentives Washington might prepare in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are willing to sacrifice to drive a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow the decline of the United States and prevent the emergence of a new ""polycentric"" world order? Anything can happen in the weeks to come. All."
2641	45	For now, Germany is in a strong position. It's up to Scholz to decide how to solve the case. Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he give in to Biden's relentless pressure? Will it chart a new course that will strengthen new alliances in the seething Eurasian Corridor or will it support Washington's savage geopolitical ambitions? Will it accept Germany's central role in a new world order, in which many emerging power centers equally share global governance and leaders will remain unswervingly committed to multilateralism, that is the question.
2644	3	I had no expectations towards Draghi. The coup de main that allowed his political rise in Italy gave a clear sign of his political program and his nature as an autocrat. But I didn't think he would fall as low as he has these days. Today in Montecitorio it was no longer clear who was the comedian between him and Zelenski.
2644	5	"Saying ""Italy wants Ukraine in the EU"" is in fact just the joke of an old actor on the boulevard. The impact on reality of this stance is zero. Only Parenzo and Severgnini can believe it. In fact, home-grown journalism feeds on similar idiocies, which, moreover, go hand in hand with the regression of political discussion to the friend/enemy scheme."
2644	7	Let no one be under the illusion that all of this is free. Do not think that there will be no consequences. The world is much bigger than those who believe that there is only the West. And the brand of gullible country in the hands of a clique of cowardly comedians and political dwarfs will stick to Italy's image for who knows how long.
2646	1	Disposable masks are made of plastic. And this is a problem
2646	3	An estimated 1.6 billion disposable masks leaked into the oceans in 2020, or more than 4 million a day. By the end of 2021, the world had generated an estimated 8 million tonnes of COVID-related plastic waste, mostly surgical masks and N95, with around 26,000 tonnes ending up in the sea. Many environmental organizations, according to W. Aaron Vandiver, writer, advocate and wildlife conservationist, have either failed to realize this reality or are hesitant to speak too loudly about the issue. During the first year of the pandemic, health experts and green groups told us to stick to reusable cloth liners (or make one out of an old T-shirt). With the rise of the more contagious omicron variant, few have spoken out about the environmental impacts of N95 masks. It may be understandable that the planet has taken a back seat to immediate concerns about human health and safety. And it hasn't helped that the mask debates have become so contentious. But now that state and local governments are pulling mandates as Omicron cases decline, we need to start a conversation about mask pollution.
2646	5	An unfortunate but unavoidable fact is that surgical and N95 masks (and personal protective equipment and test kits) are single-use plastics or, at best, dual- or triple-use plastics. Surgical masks and most respirators are made of polypropylene, a synthetic plastic fiber that, like all plastics, is generated from petroleum. While they can and often are used more than once, experts don't recommend wearing them for more than two to three days, Vandiver explains on grist.org.
2646	7	So the 400 million N95 masks the Biden administration recently began making available to Americans, and the millions of “high-quality” masks it is distributing to children, will have at most a few days of use before ending up in the trash. From there, many will end up in landfills, where they leach toxic chemicals into groundwater, or be incinerated, releasing carbon dioxide and toxic chemicals. Many more will end up in rivers and oceans and work their way down the throats of seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, which mistakenly feed on plastic and give it to their chicks. This exacerbates an already alarming problem, as an estimated 90 percent of seabirds are believed to have already ingested plastic in some form. The insidious material will also be eaten by whales, some of which have their bellies full of plastic waste. According to some estimates, plastic in the world's oceans could outnumber fish by 2050, a problem that masks will only exacerbate.
2646	9	Masks in the ocean can take up to 450 years to break down, creating smaller and smaller pieces of plastic in the process, according to marine conservation organization OceansAsia. These microplastics have an increasing impact on oceanic microorganisms and accumulate in the food chain; a 2018 study found that 100 percent of sea turtles examined had microplastics in their digestive systems. Another thing to consider: Like all single-use plastics, masks increase greenhouse gas emissions at every point in their lifecycle. Masks cannot be banned like other single-use plastics, of course, but we must recognize that they have the same devastating impact. For the good of the planet, we need to factor this into our personal decisions about whether to wear one, and politicians need to factor this in and weigh the pros and cons of mask mandates. Environmentalists may be reluctant to participate in these controversies, but we should be looking for ways to use plastic masks less without compromising their legitimate and necessary uses.
2646	10	The recycling of masks
2646	12	"It might be tempting to think we can recycle masks, or that there's some other easy solution, but managing waste from plastic products is an incredibly complex global problem with no ""one size fits all"" solution, according to a 2020 Pew Trust study. of charity. Even before COVID, Pew predicted that plastic pollution flowing into the oceans will triple by 2040, absent major regulatory and economic reforms around the world. Recycling doesn't keep single-use plastic out of the oceans, or out of landfills and incinerators, and it's estimated that 91% of the goods made from that stuff aren't recycled at all."
2646	14	"Cornell University researchers recently hatched a plan to shred masks and other PPE, then heat those smaller pieces to break them down into useful chemicals like ethylene, propylene, propane and butane. To significantly reduce plastic waste, this method would need to be implemented by states and countries on a large scale, but this type of ""chemical recycling"" has been criticized for causing carbon emissions and the release of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. And it's expensive too."
2646	15	What about reusable N95s?
2646	17	An MIT team has been investigating possible ways to decontaminate and reuse N95 masks, potentially by making them out of silicone, but we haven't seen such technologies implemented at scale so far, and it's unclear whether they're practical solutions. The fact remains that “the single-use plastic mask is just another additional burden that we are leaving for future generations“, as said Gary Stokes, the co-founder of OceansAsia.
2646	19	While a number of states recently announced plans to end or reduce mask mandates, what happens when the next variant comes along?
2646	21	Those of us who care about the state of the planet must help forge a more sustainable long-term approach. Government officials and public health experts will continue to debate the recommendations, but environmentalists can and should stand up for the planet. While N95s have wide usage, the good news is that they can provide one-way protection, meaning the wearer can protect themselves even when others around them are unmasked. A more limited and judicious approach to the use of surgical and N95 masks — encouraging use in clinical settings and to protect people vulnerable to COVID-19 by discouraging overuse among healthy and asymptomatic people — can sensibly balance priorities public health with environmental concerns, and potentially prevent large numbers of plastics from polluting the world. Aside from major technological innovations, using fewer plastic masks is the best we can do.
2646	23	Now that cases are declining and obligations, such as emergency measures are ending (at least for now), we are left with tough questions: under what circumstances is wearing, or requiring others to wear, planet-damaging masks justified? How much damage will be done to the oceans, marine life and climate if millions or billions of people continue to wear them on a regular basis? How much damage have we already done? What will it take to minimize damage in the future?
265	3	"""We have always made the most serious proposal, the most serious proposal is called a naval blockade"". While the landings of migrants continue unabated on the Italian coasts, Giorgia Meloni relaunches on Facebook the passage of her speech at the party's programmatic conference in which she reiterated that a way to stem the phenomenon exists and the Brothers of Italy have been proposing it for some time. ""It is intolerable that thanks to the incapacity of the Minister of the Interior, Luciana Lamorgese, known as Caronte, thousands of illegal immigrants continue to land on our shores when we - recalled the leader of FdI - have to deal with real refugees"". In the accompanying post to the video, Meloni then recalled that «Minister Lamorgese has let our borders be stormed by illegal immigration. The only solution to all this - warned the leader of FdI - is a naval blockade, but the immigrationist left will never understand it""."
265	4	"Meanwhile, during the night another landing was registered in Lampedusa, where 28 migrants arrived, including two women and a minor. The Guardia di Finanza intercepted the small boat on which they were traveling 4 miles off the coast of the island, where tonight's boat was the first landing after days of rest. However, this was not the case for the rest of the Italian coasts, where only yesterday 101 migrants arrived, taken to the ""safe port"" of Augusta by the Doctors Without Borders ship, Geo Barents, and 47 migrants who reached the Lecce area, between Gallipoli and Marina di Nardò, aboard a sailboat. Overall, according to data from the statistical Dashboard provided by the Interior Ministry and updated yesterday, there are already 10,862 migrants who have landed in Italy since the beginning of the year, compared to 10,064 last year and 3,543 in 2020."
2651	1	"General Jean: «Moscow got it all wrong. Putin is ill-advised. But Italy with Di Maio makes the world laugh"""
2651	3	A totally wrong war of an autocrat who has lost his rationality. And a weak Italy, which gets by by sending Di Maio around the world. This is how General Carlo Jean thinks. That in a long interview with la Verità he debunks the military strategy of the Kremlin. And he paints Putin as an isolated man. And ill-advised.
2651	5	Jean: Moscow is getting it all wrong
2651	7	"Jean does not believe Putin's narrative about NATO. “Russia has nothing to fear from NATO. Russia's deterrence is based on 5,000 nuclear warheads. Moreover, NATO is a defensive alliance and Putin knows it very well. Putin fears the EU which represents democracy, well-being, freedom of movement and expression, civil rights"". A fear - says the general - that could trigger a revolution in Russia like those of the Maidan in 2014. ""He is capable of overthrowing his power and he knows it very well""."
2651	9	Putin is isolated and ill-advised
2651	11	Putin's rationality is that of an autocrat. “All the more limited”, observes Jean, “the time spent in power. The magic circle of his advisers decreases with time ”. The 'tsar' was misinformed. “He thought he had another kind of reaction in Ukraine. He started in fourth place and got really muddy and now he doesn't know how to get out of it ”. Jean calls Russia's war strategy disastrous. “They were thinking about a blitzkrieg. With Zelensky on the run. And the imposition of a Russophile puppet government. And above all on a feeble reaction from a divided West. Instead it turned out differently. Ukrainians defend themselves. Zelensky proved to be a good communicator. And the West united as never before in history”.
2651	12	The Ukrainians and the weapons of the West
2651	14	"“Ukrainians have shown that they know how to use anti-tank weapons received from the West well. And now Russia is in a cul de sac."" But hardly - adds the general, an expert in geopolitics - Putin could think of widening the conflict. “He has few advisers left. Patushev, Sechin, Shoigu are closest. But all the others are starting to wonder if they are really in the hands of a man who makes hasty decisions for the country”."
2651	15	The nuclear threat, a blunt weapon
2651	17	The nuclear threat is also a blunt weapon. “It would have a worldwide psychological effect. Including China. The nuclear taboo of Nagasaki and Hiroshima would be overcome”. Before getting to the nuclear bomb - says Jean - Russia has many other options for an escalation. “First of all, it hasn't used bombers yet. For now we have seen fighter-bombers with limited effectiveness, 500 kilos of explosives. Robetta compared to those with which they could raze entire cities to the ground. Do you know why you don't use them? Imagine if it became known in Moscow that he destroyed the Church of St. Sophia in Kiev. From which the Russian church was born!”.
2651	18	Italy gets by with Di Maio…
2652	3	"In history so ""liquid"" nothing is definitive. And maybe now a nightmare that seemed dormant will come back. No, not nuclear power or Russian imperialism. Worse, the fight over palm oil. A long article published on Politico.eu, an online magazine always well informed on European issues, explained the terms of the question. And a disturbance at the highest levels is already foreseen for environmentalists."
2652	5	Russia and Ukraine are among the world's leading producers of sunflower oil, an ingredient used in many food products. From some types of sweets to snacks, not forgetting mayonnaise. Now, however, Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought down exports.
2652	7	"Therefore, observes Politico, ""some food companies are considering returning to palm oil and soybean oil (another bete noire for environmentalists)."" Therefore, in defiance of the fundamentalist Gretinism of the last two years, it is necessary to change the component in food processing."
2652	9	GOODBYE GRETINISM
2652	11	"There are already those who, such as the case of the British chain ""Iceland"", a brand that has been dealing with frozen products for more than fifty years, have announced their yes to palm oil. The alternative, said the chain's CEO, would be to take some products off the market."
2652	13	"However, according to Politico, some companies in the European Union are already implementing a conversion of recipes. Although it is not easy. The spokesman of a food multinational, who spoke anonymously, said that this step is not easy: ""We have to understand what the impact is"", and the reference is both to the environment and to the nutritional values ​​of the preparations. Certainly, however, looking at our home, Barilla has one certainty: it will not return to palm oil, it assures, an ingredient abandoned in 2016. However, those who market palm oil, which in recent years it had seen its shares of the European market shrink, now it rubs its hands and can't wait to go back to selling in the old continent."
2652	15	"This is inferred from a paper published on the website of the ""Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries"", a trade association that brings together companies from Malaysia and Indonesia, and represents around 85% of total production."
2652	17	In this document, the association argues that the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war has made the use of sunflower oil as a raw material economically unsustainable. And so for many companies, going back to palm oil could be the only solution.
2652	18	"Although there is full awareness of the campaigns of recent years against this component and of the fact that many brands have put the words ""palm oil free"" on their packaging to reassure a consumer subjected to a real media bombardment. «We are ready to assist these companies», argues the Council in the paper, as well as refute the detractors of the ingredient with scientific evidence."
2652	20	MANICHEAN CLASH
2652	22	"If the producers are ready to attack the market, however, on the other side there are those who fear all the risks involved. Thus, Politico reports the words of Kiki Taufik, an Indonesian Greenpeace activist who sees in all this ""bad news for people, forests and wildlife""."
2652	23	In short, there are the prerequisites for a return to an old Manichean confrontation although, it is to be believed, with less intensity than in the three-year period 2014-2016. Today we have other problems and many other threats.
2653	3	"George Soros has funded radical environmental groups collaborating in this week's ""Global Climate Strike"" to the tune of $25 million, according to a new report."
2653	5	At least 22 of the left-wing activist groups listed as partners in the Global Climate Strike received $24,854,592 in funding from liberal billionaire George Soros between 2000-2017 through his Open Society Network, Joseph Vazquez told the Media Research Center on Thursday.
2653	7	Though ostensibly triggered by protests by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the Global Climate Strike bore the indelible fingerprints of well-funded radical environmental activists from its inception. Apparently, much of the funding comes from professional disruptor George Soros.
2653	9	"Among the organizations that received funding from Soros were the Global Human Rights Fund, the Global Greengrants Fund, 350.org, Amnesty International, Avaaz, Color of Change and People's Action. Each of these groups has climate-related agendas and goals ranging from reducing global carbon emissions to less than 350 parts per million and 100 percent ""clean energy,"" to eliminating new fossil fuel projects and a "" green movement for civil rights""."
2653	11	Other major donors have included Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, NextGen America, and the Sierra Club, which has reportedly received millions from former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
2653	13	The 350.org group, founded by Bill McKibben in 2008, fought against coal in India and tried to stop the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States
2653	15	As children marched, sang and twerked for the Global Climate Strike, a group of more than 500 scientists and professionals appealed to the United Nations for an eagerly awaited open debate on climate change.
2653	17	Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific, the scientists said in their statement sent to the UN secretary-general.
2653	19	“Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their global warming predictions, while policymakers should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of global warming adaptation and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation,” they said.
2653	22	The signatories also insisted that public policies must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the hottest trend of the day.
2653	24	“ There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no reason for panic and alarm,” they noted. “We are firmly against the harmful and unrealistic zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”
2654	3	There is a lot of misinformation about the current situation in Ukraine, I will try to clarify a bit, based on my personal direct experience.
2654	5	In the meantime, let's begin to clarify an important point: Ukraine is an independent country, it is not part of Russia. It was under the rule of the Soviet Union, as well as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and many other countries now free and independent, but the independence from the Soviet dictatorship, won in 1991, has shattered the former USSR. Unfortunately, political figures like Putin have always claimed that Ukraine is a Russian territory and have never recognized its independence.
2654	7	That said, which should help to understand the political scenario of the relationship between Russia and Ukraine a little better, there are certainly areas inside Ukraine that claim a more pro-Russian ethnicity: Crimea, Donbass, to name a few. A bit like saying that Bolzano feels more Austrian than Italian, or Istria more Italian than Croatian. There are always and always will be these independence bubbles in any country in the world.
2654	9	Taking advantage of this sentiment, Putin leveraged the desire of a few thousand people living in these regions to take back these territories. In practice, colonial expansion disguised as the salvation of Russian compatriots on Ukrainian soil.
2654	11	"This war is a war of conquest with territorial annexation, which undermines the fundamental values ​​of freedom and human rights of Europe itself. Ukraine has invited residents of these areas to choose: if you are Russian, please go and live in Russia, otherwise stay with us as citizens of Ukraine. When invited to go and live in Russia, the inhabitants of Crimea and Donbass replied ""nyet, you go and live in Russia"". There must be a reason…"
2654	13	Offended by this refusal, the Russian government decided to intervene militarily (year 2014) to regain possession of these territories. Not only in Ukraine, but also in Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia, even a few years earlier, in 2008). Even today these regions are militarily occupied by the Russians.
2654	15	Many governments have succeeded one another in Kyiv, some pro-Russian, some pro-Western. The events of the Orange Revolution of 2004 emitted a clear sentiment in the hearts of Ukrainians: we want to join Europe. Since then, a necessary process has started to be able to accept Ukraine in Europe, which has recently accelerated with President Zelensky.
2654	17	Zelensky was accused of incompetence because he is an actor, as if this were a fault. From memory, I remember a certain Ronald Reagan who did the same job, one of the best presidents that the USA has ever had, the one who negotiated the end of armed conflicts with… hey look what a coincidence, the Soviets! But think about what these actors are capable of…
2654	19	Lacking other arguments, Zelensky's detractors accuse him of being a neo-Nazi. For the record, Zelensky is of Jewish descent, his parents are Jewish, his great-grandfather died in the Holocaust. He and Nazism hit us like cheese on tuna.
2654	21	A quick thought on the situation in Crimea and Donbass: do we really believe that the Ukrainian army would attack the Ukrainian regions themselves, their own population? It doesn't add up to me, the tanks that go around in those regions fly the Soviet flag (yes, just the hammer and sickle on a red background). Is it more likely that the Ukrainians have been waging war on their brothers and sisters for 8 years, or that the Russian army has invaded these regions with the aim of annexing their territory?
2654	23	Another reflection, and sorry if I dwell on it: who has a history of violence against their own people, to the point of starving millions of people on their own territory, citizens of the Soviet Union left to starve on their own lands? The genocide called Holodomor in the 30s of the last century was the extermination of millions of fellow citizens by starvation, caused by Stalin. The film “Mr Jones” with Gareth Jones, from 2019, describes it well: www.imdb.com/title/tt6828390.
2654	25	I have no prejudices and I am open to constructive and polite dialogue. And then an invitation: go and live in Ukraine for a year, as I have done, and tell me how you are. Certainly not everything is perfect, and many services are struggling to function properly, but tell me, how many in Italy work very well instead? Surely there are many corrupt politicians in the Ukrainian government, but don't tell me that the Italian one is made up of saints' shins.
2654	27	But there is an air of freedom, of awakening from the torpor that Soviet domination has imposed for years, starting with the annihilation of the Ukrainian language, religion and culture. Now the current generation travels, reads, gets informed, participates. It's free.
2655	3	The tone of the United States towards Russia has changed, this is what the New York Times said today anyway: to lead this fight in Ukraine to bring down Russia, so that the monopoly of Atlanticist governance will never again be questioned. The gist remains the same, as it is indeed the same battle that has been going on since Russia reared its head, but now things are clear.
2655	5	This morning's NYT post has an even more belligerent tone than usual, following the appearance of Blinken and Austin in Kiev. It was actually Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who said from Poland:
2655	7	"""We want to see Russia weakened to such an extent that it can't do the kind of thing it did by invading Ukraine."""
2655	9	Russia must therefore not, in the future, have the right to react when a military conflict is maintained by the United States on its border, as happened for 8 years in the Donbass, following the Maidan coup and the attack of the Forces Ukrainian armies against the Russian-speaking populations of the East. Russia must therefore no longer be able to react in the future if a military attack is directed against it.
2655	11	In short, Russia as a state must thus disappear, if one reads between the lines.
2655	12	And this hardening of the line is formulated by the NYT in its first sentence of the day's announcements:
2655	14	“In an important change, yesterday the United States strengthened its message on the war in Ukraine, saying that the American goal was not only to counter the Russian invasion, but also to weaken Russia so that it can no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere ”.
2655	16	The global world allows for a single political decision-making centre, which must be sovereign and it is only up to that, to none other than that, to decide the battles to wage and the interests to defend. One world, one single super power, therefore one single sovereign state.
2655	17	"Leaving aside the rhetoric of ""aggression"", which is very useful for legitimizing the military support provided to this puppet government of Kiev, the real question at stake is in fact that of the right of states, other than the United States, to be sovereign."
2656	3	The story seems to have restarted. It was never really over, but some liked to think so.
2656	5	A new era has started since February 24, 2022. We are facing years, perhaps decades, of profound transformation. Epochal transformations, such as those read only in history books.
2656	7	"I wrote an article 10 days before the start of the special military operation of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, arguing that no war would break out between Russia and NATO, that ""the Russian political elite will not let ”. On the fact that a war with NATO will not break out I am still convinced (although the orthodoxy with which I apply my materialistic thinking does not prevent me from giving myself a sincere wink), on the fact that Russia would have continued on the defensive I screwed up big time . Actually I wasn't the only one who thought so, it was an opinion shared by others. Others, like me, who are not Russians. And above all we are not the Russian political elite. I was personally convinced that Russia would do everything possible to stay in the good graces of the West. At least to make sure that if the Great Reset was to be, it would only be us who were reset. Russia's brave-face strategy on the pandemic issue foreshadowed this: go ahead and play your dirty games, but not at our house. Russia, on the other hand, has decided to abandon the West. It is not worth maintaining relations with those who have been carrying out a hostile policy towards you for decades, going so far as to disseminate your neighboring countries with laboratories to experiment with chemical weapons designed to selectively kill your people. Trying to be integrated into the Western economic system is not worth the candle. Keeping trying is a waste of time. It's wasted effort. Of all the things I've read about the letter ""Z"" I haven't read one, or maybe it escaped me, that is: we are at the end of the alphabet. Words are no longer needed. And you made it so."
2656	9	Until recently I still wondered if this special military operation was really necessary. Why didn't the Russians wait to be attacked before intervening? So that we have some sort of legitimacy and not be attacked by Western media at the level we've reached? Level that was largely predictable. Why send troops and not just launch missiles on military bases and assets? Why risk the lives of Ukrainian civilians in any way? A brother people?
2656	11	I understood this talking to S., a Ukrainian friend of mine. We met a few years ago for work reasons, then we also met in person, he came to visit me with his family during their trip to Europe. He wrote to me in 2015: “Americans did a revolution here ..”. With him there was a certain communion in geopolitical analysis. When on February 24th I wrote to him what was happening in his city, he answered me after a few days in a way that I certainly did not expect. As for Russia, most western and central Ukrainians have the idea of ​​a hostile country. Which has always been hostile, and will always be a threat. Like him, other Ukrainian acquaintances here in Italy think the same way. He plays down militias and neo-Nazi groups as if they were highly minority and not an integral part of the army and the state. On the armed confrontation with the republics of Donbass he talks about it as if it weren't a decisive issue. When I asked him about the massacre in Odessa, his city, he replied that it was a horrible thing, but that the pro-Russian groups were also preparing an attack. For him, the cause of the war is the will of an old and sick man to become the new Tsar. And he is Russian-speaking, of Russian ethnicity.
2656	13	When you understand the level of anti-Russian propaganda carried out by the Ukrainian regime media in recent years, you understand why the special military operation began.
2656	15	If confrontation is unavoidable, strike first.
2656	17	I tried to tell S. that Russia's goal is to eliminate the threat posed by neo-Nazi militias and to secure Donbass and the borders, to nullify Ukraine's offensive military potential and make it geopolitically neutral, but for him Putin wants to invade and occupy Ukraine, and beyond. After a month and a half spent as a refugee in a country bordering Romania, he decided to return to Odessa. He says that when the Russian army is at the gates of the city he will go to fight.
2656	19	I cannot accept that a friend of mine risks his life to fight the war wanted by the elites. From those power groups who see in him nothing but cannon fodder, an asset to be sacrificed for their imperial projects.
2656	21	The story has started again, and immediately the harsh reality is slammed in your face. The reality of all wars, fought by the many, for the sake of the few.
2656	23	I wonder then, for how long here in the West we will continue to let ourselves be commanded by those accursed elites. When and if we ever succeed in reversing the balance of forces.
2656	25	The greatest period of development in the West occurred under the Soviet Union. The geopolitical balance had allowed Europe to develop social democracy, until now the best development model ever experienced for the well-being of the masses. Are we facing a new cold war? If this were the case, there is a large part of the people in the West who could make their voices heard loudly, and try to take back everything they have stolen from us in recent decades. If that were the case, we should start thinking it's actually possible. And we'll have to do it quickly.
2656	27	Who are we? Certainly all that public in the West who read independent news. Those conspiracy magazines that infest the web. But they're starting to get scary. And the regime's propaganda is starting to smell too bad, even for those who held their noses until yesterday.
2656	29	If this historical period opens up a new phase, and new spaces for us in the West, we should still act quickly. You never know that tomorrow they will be able to develop a virus that selectively kills conspiracy theorists.
2656	31	"We could make the party of the ""No Vax Putinians"". Which probably won't get more votes than ""The other NATO with Zelensky"", which will all come together in a 40% PD. On the other hand, however, the new gatekeepers such as the legendary Giorgia, the unlucky version of the newly defeated Marine in France, will make great results. Or maybe Viganò's Christian alliance will take care of it, or Commander Donald's forces of light will defeat the darkness of the NWO once and for all."
2656	33	I don't know if it's healthy realism or toxic naivety that makes me believe that the masses in the West aren't definitively a stinking useless putrefaction. I certainly feel happy when I think that we are only 13% of the world's population.
2657	3	"Reflecting on the facts of Peschiera, it would seem that a century has passed since the accusations of feminists against the Alpini, guilty of non-existent harassment against some women during the Rimini gathering. There are also those who have proposed canceling the annual event because it is a symbol of the ""white and straight male"" that toxic feminism just does not tolerate. A whistle, the so-called catcalling, and a compliment, albeit coarse, have turned into attacks and are making the real meaning of sexual violence lose. This constant crying wolf will play down the complaints of truly abused women. And this is probably the strategy: falsely accusing Italians of harassing women to minimize the actual rapes of immigrants. In 2020, foreigners were arrested and reported for 41 percent of sexual assaults."
2657	5	It is true that Italians commit sexual violence against women but it is also true that the rate of propensity of immigrants to this crime is 7.6 higher than that of Italians.
2657	7	From the violence of New Year's Eve in Milan to that of Peschiera del Garda
2657	9	"The violence and sexual harassment committed by gangs of immigrants and by boys of the so-called second generation are growing at an unprecedented rate. Like France, England and Sweden, Italy is now prey to ferocious gangs of foreigners who, feeling unpunished, strike with complete indifference. We have witnessed the barbarism of Piazza Duomo in Milan on New Year's Eve, we read almost daily in the local news of the rapes committed by immigrants in Italian cities and of the violence by baby gangs which terrorize entire neighbourhoods, and now we have seen the wave of violence which it crashed into Peschiera del Garda, where about two thousand foreign boys gathered. To the battle cries of ""Africa in Peschiera"" and ""White women here don't go up"", gangs of North Africans stormed the town, stealing, looting and harassing young girls returning from Gardaland. This tsunami of violence could have been avoided if only the Minister of the Interior Luciana Lamorgese had listened to the appeal of the mayor of Peschiera del Garda, Maria Orietta Gaiulli. Perhaps the minister was too busy arranging the reception of immigrants transhipped in Italian ports by NGO ships."
2657	10	The hypocrisy and double standard of the left and toxic feminism
2657	12	We would certainly not have expected a tough stance against the violence in Peschiera del Garda from those who supported clandestine immigration with their own policies, but neither did we expect the most complete censorship of the identity of those who committed such barbarities. Not a word on the origin of the perpetrators of the violence in the posts of Pd exponents Laura Boldrini, Monica Cirinnà, Debora Serracchiani and Alessia Rotta. Secretary Enrico Letta limited himself to retweeting Serracchiani's post. Indeed, the feminists of Non una di meno have self-censored themselves, preferring not even to report the news of sexual abuse in Peschiera del Garda. The same, having arrived in Rimini, had collected the bogus complaints of the women harassed by the Alpine troops, also offering legal assistance. Perhaps for feminists, not all women are the same and deserve solidarity. The facts of Peschiera represent the clear failure of the multiethnic society
2658	3	"""Damned No Vax, it's all your fault if there is still Covid!"". Does the sentence mean something to you? How many times have you heard it repeated!? Or: “No Vax people are at risk 12 times more or 25 times more than vaccinated people of getting sick”. Too bad they ended up in the hospital for Covid both vaccinated and unvaccinated."
2658	5	Good. For some time, however, even those who have had two doses of the vaccine have been considered No Vax (not vaccinated). Because only those who have taken a complete cycle of doses are considered vaccinated, having also had the third inoculated. So if you have only done two doses you are not considered vaccinated. It has been happening since the third dose was available, that is, for a few months.
2658	7	From here derive and will derive the calculations on mortality and the relationship between vaccinated and No Vax. That is, millions of Italians who have made two doses of the vaccine are automatically transformed into No Vax. And it's not a conspiracy theorist who says it directly but the institutions that less than a year after the reader wrote it (who cited the British Medical Journal and Peter Doshi in January 2021) discover that the duration of vaccines is a few months , when there is.
2658	9	"On the relationship between vaccinated and non-vaccinated, the explanation of the Piedmont Region is clear which last January 8, in an informative tweet complete with photos and caption of the relationship between vaccinated and non-vaccinated, explains who the ""non-vaccinated"" are. The acronym ""not vaccinated"" in red is followed by two asterisks. Below, at the bottom left, the reference of the two asterisks. By non-vaccinated, we mean ""non-adherent or without a complete cycle"". Translated: if you have only done two doses, therefore you have not done the third, you are counted among the unvaccinated as those who have not done any doses."
2658	11	“Damned No Vax. They only made two doses ”. You will have to say from today.
2658	13	"Let's hear the explanation and calculation of the ratio between vaccinated and non-vaccinated that Professor Carlo Torti, director of infectious diseases at the Catanzaro Polyclinic, gives to Rai 3 Regionale, again on 8 January 2022: ""If we consider the vaccination with the third dose, that's right, in fact he can be considered a vaccinated patient, we understood this, only if he has also received the third dose... we have 7% of patients in our ward who have received the third dose and are in resuscitation, where 6 out of 6 beds are occupied, all hospitalized patients are absolutely not vaccinated ""."
2658	15	It is clear how the ratio between vaccinated and unvaccinated is calculated today: those who have done two doses are No Vax, not ideologically but in fact because they have not been vaccinated with a full cycle, while those who have done three doses are considered vaccinated.
2658	17	Haven't you figured it out yet?
2658	19	"So let's hear the explanation of Francesco Vaia, director of the Spallanzani Institute in Rome on Domenica In, questioned by an astonished Mara Venier, due to the growing numbers of infections and deaths: “But you are a bit deluded, aren't you? We thought that with the vaccine, with the third dose it would no longer arrive... eh!"""
2658	21	"Vaia replies on the point by clarifying that on two key battles, the overcoming of the patent and the updating of vaccines, we have not done well: ""I am not saying that we have lost but that to date we have not won"". Then Vaia gets to the point: ""Now, and I'll tell you the numbers, when we make the ratio (the ratio between vaccinated and unvaccinated, ed), it is no longer done until the second dose but it must be done in those who have had the booster dose , i.e. the third dose. And the report, I tell you today's numbers at Spallazani, say: that people who are either not vaccinated or vaccinated up to the second dose are over 90% hospitalized in ordinary hospitalization. relationship is even more evident, i.e. we have 95% of people who are not vaccinated or vaccinated in double doses and people instead, 5%, vaccinated in the third dose. So what is the issue? We must now push on the third dose because the third dose, the numbers, not the talk, the numbers tell us that it works, and then we have to update the vaccines and get to October and make an annual booster dose ”."
2658	23	The third dose works! Works! But beyond the explanations that the professors try to give, the government says it: it works! Every year everyone will have to get a vaccine in order not to be considered No Vax. It is not known how many inoculations, since the antibody protection lasts a few months. Because? Because it works! The government says so! It works so much that even those just vaccinated get sick and end up in the hospital. We are seeing these days and we will see it every winter how it works. How Astrazeneca worked, how the first dose worked, the second and now the third. In addition, exorbitant deaths due to an adverse reaction and those who remain with a disability for life do not exist. Because? Because it works!
2659	3	It must also be maintained out of seriousness towards the rest of the population who have done everything they had to do and who could ask themselves: in the end there was a sort of amnesty for the unvaccinated
2659	5	"The vaccination obligation remains for the over 50s even after June 15 and no amnesty for those who have not been vaccinated. Massimo Galli, former director of infectious diseases at the Sacco hospital in Milan, does not mince words: ""The obligation of anti-Covid vaccination for the over 50s must be maintained without ifs and buts. It would be yet another amnesty"" for the unvaccinated ""in the country of amnesties"". The obligation must be maintained ""also out of seriousness towards the rest of the population who have done everything they had to do, getting vaccinated, and who, if called for further interventions if necessary, could ask themselves: 'so in the end, was there some kind of amnesty for the unvaccinated? Were they the smart ones and we the idiots?'""."
2659	7	"For this reason Galli is against letting the obligation lapse: ""we will have an amnesty in which the State doesn't care for not having paid taxes, but the community cares for not having taken precautions that concern themselves and others"". And on the ""no vax"" logic of ""I can decide to die on my own"" shoots the Azeri: ""This reasoning does not apply, it is unacceptable because hospitals are full of people, whose hospitalizations are paid for with our taxes, and there are so many the surgeries and the postponed services that who knows when they will be able to be done. All this will weigh heavily on the health of the Italians""."
266	3	This could only be called Stoltemberg. The beginning of his surname says it all.
266	5	"One thing is clear: if Ukraine were to lose strength, trust and give in to the Russians and cede Crimea, NATO would prevent it with all its might. This is the meaning of the words of the general secretary of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, interviewed by the German newspaper Die Welt. “NATO members will never accept the illegal annexation of Crimea. We have always opposed Russian control over parts of Donbass in eastern Ukraine."" Putin is warned: he is not fighting only against a people, but one can say against a large part of the West. NATO is aware, however, that Russia's war against Ukraine ""will not end soon, but that Ukraine will win it with the help of the Atlantic Alliance"", reiterated the secretary general. The Alliance is determined to help Kiev ""even if it will take months or years"" to defeat Putin and his ambitions, noting that ""everything possible"" will be done so that the conflict does not expand. Stoltenberg, in his long interview, emphasized the fact that Ukraine will do everything to win ""this war because it defends its territory"" and it is right that, as an attacked country, it defends itself and does not have to passively suffer the russian army."
266	7	It is you who are attacking Russia by surrounding it. And the very idea of ​​thinking about taking Ukraine and Donbass away from Russia – they are regions inhabited by Russians – means having to prepare for nuclear war. Because that is Russia, and it is the red line drawn by Putin whose violation would trigger the nuclear response.
266	9	Then NATO explains why they bombed Serbia to 'liberate' Kosovo with an Albanian majority and always Serbian, but then the exclusively Russian Crimea should not be able to do the same.
2660	1	Dear Draghi, it is the vaccinated who clog up the intensive care units
2660	2	In an attempt to foment social hatred against no vaxes, the premier demonstrated the ineffectiveness and harmfulness of vaccines.
2660	4	"In an attempt to foment social hatred against no vaxes, the premier demonstrated the ineffectiveness and harmfulness of vaccines. The data pulled out by the non-elected Draghi and his reptilian appearance (which is synonymous with the Dalemian) Speranza, are based on the usual cheap frame. The no-vax ""godless and wicked"" who block the country, as highlighted by the newspaper La Verità, are mostly the vaccinated, and this happens in the world where everything is possible, that of the ""sovereign lie"" or the regime media. A bivaccinated person who, having suffered adverse effects, does not want to take the third dose is a no vax, and if the complications of these adverse effects lead him to intensive care, he is an irresponsible person who clogs up intensive care, exactly like an unvaccinated person - who looks case, in intensive care it ends up in an extremely minor percentage, but it is merged into a single label with the reluctant double dose, as explained in Spallanzani's data that we read in L'Antidiplomatico:"
2660	6	"The premier's phrase is chilling: ""most of the problems depend on no vax""."
2660	8	But who are the no vaxes to download the failure, inefficiency and incompetence of the Draghi government?
2660	10	"Because here is a surprise that not everyone has grasped but which the director of Spallanzani Vaia has definitively clarified recently in a Rai Uno broadcast. The unvaccinated (the no vax) are those who have not received the third dose. Therefore – Aristotelian logic – people with two doses are classified as “unvaccinated” or “novax”. “A patient can only be considered vaccinated if he has also received the third dose. We have 7% of patients in our ward who have received the third dose and in resuscitation, where six out of six beds are occupied, all hospitalized patients are absolutely not vaccinated "", a Rai 3 TGR then further specified."
2660	12	"This would explain the data from hospitalized or in intensive care which detect a higher incidence of no vax than those who have also completed the third dose which it is good to remember began only in mid-September. ""When the relationship is to be done, it should no longer be done until the second dose, but it must be done in those who have had the booster dose, i.e. the third dose,"" Vaia specified again."
2660	14	Then he dissects the numbers of Spallanzani: “More than 90% of people hospitalized in ordinary hospitalization are not vaccinated or vaccinated until the second dose. In intensive care we have 95% of people who are not vaccinated or vaccinated in a double dose, 5% vaccinated in a third dose”. He candidly declared Vaia, also giving a completely different meaning to the graphs published by Speranza…
2661	2	The agreement with the United States on refugees is almost ready. Canada will receive the Haitians. Here is a lesson that Italy could use
2661	4	With open arms. Spain is in talks with the United States to welcome migrants fleeing Latin America. The same goes for Canada, ready to receive the Haitians. For the moment, the negotiation is still open, the final decision will be made during the Summit of the Americas scheduled for next week in Los Angeles.
2661	6	Because Madrid wants to welcome migrants from Latin America
2661	8	Steps that are significant from a political point of view but which have great practical implications for Europeans, including Italians. In fact, Madrid accepted the operation because it needs workers, especially in the construction sector, in order not to lose European Union funds after the economic crisis caused by the Covid pandemic.
2661	10	"The news site Axios was the first to report possible migratory commitments from Spain and Canada, citing the documents of the ""Los Angeles Declaration"", i.e. the text being prepared with the conclusions of the summit. According to this information, Spain will make ""modest but symbolically important"" commitments, in order to increase the number of South American refugees transferred to its borders. The program already discussed during the Spain-Us Working Group on Central America, which met on May 25, envisaged doubling, or even tripling, the number of temporary workers in Central America. Now the final word will be up to the Los Angeles summit."
2661	12	An agreement that benefits everyone
2661	14	The US would thus lighten the burden of migratory flows from Latin America. Republicans had accused the Biden administration of having neglected the migration issue in the southern states of the country that press on the southern borders of the US, or even of having encouraged it with its too permissive policies. For that, the president needs a victory to please Congress with him. On the other hand, Spain needs workers. About 1.8 million jobs were eliminated in 2008 but now there is a need thanks to Pnrr funds. To exploit the 140 billion Spain must hire and South American migrants could easily fill those jobs. Compared to migrants from Asia or Africa, refugees from Central America speak Spanish and above all relations with the former colonies and Spain have always been favorable. According to Reuters, however, seven out of ten companies were forced to give up orders in 2021 because they do not have enough staff.
2662	3	Rome, May 27 - Monkeypox in Europe would have spread thanks to the celebrations of Gay Pride in the Canary Islands. This is what was reported by the local health authorities of Maspalomas, in the south of Gran Canaria, where from 5 to 15 May about 80 thousand people gathered for a non-stop maxi-party organized to celebrate the twenty-sixth winter Pride election.
2662	5	According to the health authorities, during the celebrations that involved tourists from all over Europe and beyond, there was a person positive for monkeypox who would have triggered the outbreak. The virus, we recall, is transmitted through close interpersonal contacts. And five days of Pride, with its undeniable backdrop of sexual promiscuity taken to an extreme, would have been a perfect trigger.
2662	7	Monkeypox, case zero at Pride in the Canary Islands
2662	9	"Local LGBT activists are now trembling, worried about the stigma that could fall on the community, and the island's tour operators, worried about bad publicity and the consequent repercussions on the economic sector from which Gran Canaria actually survives. ""There is concern because what is happening could put our Maspalomas in a bad light,"" explains Edward Timon, activist of the local LGBT community and editor of an information site. ""The LGBTQ+ community shouldn't be afraid to face the problem, which can happen to anyone and, among other things, it's much better to educate about behaviors to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, compared to heterosexuals""."
2662	10	A decline in attention to sexually transmitted diseases
2662	12	"But according to what was reported by Andre van Wanrooij, politician and former organizer of the Maspalomas Pride, the threshold of attention towards sexually transmitted diseases has significantly lowered. Again in Repubblica he denounces the emergence of a certain laxity towards such an important issue. ""Together with another association, we gave out free condoms, provided information on prevention, organized meetings, ensured health care, but all of this no longer exists and even if we didn't know of the arrival of smallpox, in any case, more careful behavior would be served to prevent that disease as well», denounces van Wanrooij."
2663	3	The vaccination campaign, which has generated so much controversy, has however increased the number of Italians in favor of vaccinations
2663	5	So much for no-vax, one might say. The Covid-19 Pandemic, which has generated so many discussions around vaccines, has instead increased the confidence of Italians in this formidable means of prevention and defense against diseases (this is irrefutable, however one thinks about vaccines).
2663	7	With the Covid-19 pandemic, Italians' confidence in vaccinations has increased: more than 9 out of 10 citizens consider vaccines safe and effective tools. Among the hesitant, 1 out of 2 is open to reevaluating their choices. A greater dialogue with the doctor and the pharmacist, clear and transparent information/communication from the institutions, the increase in places of administration (pharmacy, workplace and school) and incentives are the factors that emerge as decisive for increasing the propensity to get vaccinated, even among the hesitant. This is what emerges from the survey, conducted on a sample of 2 thousand citizens, carried out by The European House -Ambrosetti and by the Interdepartmental Center for Ethics and Integrity in Research of the National Research Council (CNR), in collaboration with SWG, presented in Rome during an event organized by The European House - Ambrosetti with the unconditional contribution of Pfizer.
2663	9	The survey therefore revealed that 92% believe that vaccines are a safe and effective health tool for combating infectious diseases and that for 33% of those interviewed, the level of trust during the pandemic has increased, especially in men, in the Regions of the South and among Generation Z. Positive signals also in view of the resumption of the anti-Covid vaccination campaign next autumn: 77% declare themselves in favor of the fourth dose of the anti-Covid vaccination next autumn and 17% of those who do not he is still vaccinated and is open to doing so. The data on flu vaccination is also encouraging, with 95% of subjects who were vaccinated in the last season declaring themselves in favor of repeating the administration. It also emerged that 88% of the interviewees feel informed about vaccines, preferring their trusted doctor, the opinion of scientists and institutional websites as sources of information; informal information channels, such as friends and relatives and social media/forums/blogs, remain the sources most used by those most skeptical of vaccinations.
2663	11	Furthermore, knowledge of mandatory vaccinations is good, knowledge of the other recommended vaccines is poor: 98% of those interviewed say they are aware of the existence of mandatory vaccinations in the pediatric age but only 76% remember at least some of them, values ​​that decrease respectively 94% and 63% for recommended childhood vaccinations. In both cases, people with minor children and women are among the best informed.
2663	13	"The law on the compulsory nature of vaccines for the 0-16 age group and the numerous awareness-raising initiatives carried out have certainly contributed to increasing the level of knowledge of pediatric vaccinations with consequent coverage rates which, although decreasing during the pandemic, stand at on values ​​above 90%. The situation of adolescent and adult vaccinations is different. Only 34% declared having been vaccinated against papilloma virus (in the 18-30 age group), only 28% against pneumococcus (in the 60-70 age group), only 11% against herpes zoster (in the 60-70 age group). ""The survey provides some important indications on the levers on which to act to improve citizens' knowledge and, consequently, trust in vaccine prevention"", says Daniela Bianco, partner and head of the Healthcare area of ​​The European House - Ambrosetti. ""Furthermore, 1 in 2 of those hesitant and opposed to some vaccinations such as the anti-pneumococcal, anti-herpes-zoster and anti-papilloma virus vaccines declare themselves willing to learn more before being able to decide. The need therefore emerges to increase efforts in communication to increase the level of citizens' knowledge also on these vaccinations"". And again: 83% of the interviewees declare that they know people who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated: if 26% hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated for all vaccines in general, 57% are only so in reference to the anti-Covid vaccine.The perceived obstacles to vaccination are essentially: the fear of health risks and information gaps (incorrect or missing information).Even among subjects who have declared that they do not consider vaccines safe and effective and those not vaccinated against Covid, the fear related to safety is confirmed as the main reason for non-vaccination, followed by doubts relating to the experiments."
2664	3	"Rome, 15 June - Stop everyone, the term ""monkeypox"" or monkeypox is racist and creates stigma against Africans precisely because it contains the word ""monkeys"". This is claimed by thirty scientists from all over the world - people who evidently have a lot of free time when they are not working in the laboratory - who last week signed and sent a letter to the WHO with an appeal: urgently change the name."
2664	5	Monkeypox discriminates against Africans
2664	7	"The same happened for the coronavirus or Chinese virus, now mutated into Covid, to prevent the epidemic from being identified with China (from where, moreover, it developed under circumstances that are far from clear and far from clarified, thanks to the Beijing's filibuster). An appeal, if you think about it, which is - comically - more racist than the denomination itself: first of all because monkeys don't live only in Africa. Secondly, labeling as ""discriminatory"" against Africans a term that contains the word ""monkeys"" reveals a retro-thinking bordering on a supremacist, who has very little progressism."
2664	9	WHO will change the name
2664	11	"Proposal that WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed with enthusiasm, announcing in this regard that he had convened the WHO Emergency Committee for June 23 to discuss the serious and very urgent issue ""We are working on a solution with partners and experts from all over the world"", and the new definition will be made public ""as soon as possible"". Also on the agenda is the opportunity to declare the monkeypox outbreak (we will continue to call it that) ""an international emergency"", given its ""unusual and worrying"" characteristics."
2665	3	When the ecorompiballe of Extinction rebellion finds in his path the pissed-off motorist queuing on the Grande an ecologist originally from Great Britain had the unfortunate idea of ​​interrupting traffic on the Gra during rush hour, with a sit-in protest against global warming. The scene was captured by Local Team cameras. And the aforementioned motorists have not been watching,
2665	5	Gretini vs. motorists
2665	7	"""You broke er c ..., go to work"" is the kindest phrase to come out of the mouth of motorists bottled up on the Capitoline road artery. Which already of him - that is, when the ecological beguines don't get involved - presents well-known problems of sliding. Imagine, therefore, if a small group of soy eaters, complete with a banner, decides to sit in the middle of the road, leaving thousands of drivers in line under the scorching sun heading towards their workplace in the capital."
2665	9	Go to work
2665	11	"""If we weren't desperate we wouldn't be doing this,"" shouts one of the Gretinos as a bald brute drags him away from the center of the street. But what do these Capitoline louts want to know about global pollution: in fact, the same thug gloriously picks up another, and yet another, moving the activists around like sacks of potatoes. “I have to go to work, earn food for my children!” an exasperated woman yells as she rolls up the banner and throws it over the guard rail."
2667	3	"“We asked ourselves: how can thousands of people, including many children, die at sea? The answer was: let's create… humanitarian corridors for refugees”. Thus the Community of Sant'Egidio advertised the initiative of the so-called humanitarian corridors on its website. A project set up ""with the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy, the Tavola Valdese and the CEI-Caritas, completely self-financed"", reads the website. The memorandum of understanding for the implementation of the ""Opening of humanitarian corridors"" project was, inter alia, signed at the Interior Ministry by the Ministries of the Interior and Foreign Affairs, the Community of Sant'Egidio and the CEI, in 2019."
2667	5	The declared objectives of the “humanitarian corridors”
2667	7	"The Community of Sant'Egidio then explains precisely the objectives of the humanitarian corridors. Among these, we read: ""Avoiding the journeys of refugees with death boats in the Mediterranean"". And at the same time ""counter the deadly business of smugglers and traffickers of men, women and children"". In addition to ""granting people in 'vulnerable conditions' (e.g. victims of persecution, torture and violence, families with children, single women, the elderly, the sick, people with disabilities) legal entry into Italian territory with a humanitarian visa, and subsequent presentation of the asylum application”. The same ""public association of the laity of the Church"" also claims that to implement the project ""the associations send volunteers to the site, who make direct contact with the refugees in the countries affected by the project, prepare a list of potential beneficiaries to be sent to the consular authorities Italian""."
2667	9	So we import migrants… from Greece
2669	3	"In Rome, part of the money allocated by the EU due to the pandemic is taken. Precisely 11 million euros, to be allocated to the redevelopment of a red social center, occupied for 20 years by the extreme left. We are talking about a former barracks, for which a restructuring plan is envisaged at best, as part of the ""Porto Fluviale Rec House"" project, with the construction of houses and shops ""assigned and given away"" to the ""comrade occupants"". The building, declared an asset of historic-artistic interest by the Mibact, is owned by the Air Force. Since 2003 it has been the subject of illegal housing occupation by 56 families from 13 different countries."
2669	5	Gualtieri and squatters: the redevelopment project of a red social centre
2669	7	As the Casapound spokesman, Luca Mastella, denounces, «in Rome there are 13,000 people waiting for public housing. People fooled yet again, with a project already funded, and masquerading as a public housing plan. But which in reality is nothing more than a millionaire gift to social centers and the extreme left of the capital. After almost twenty years of occupation - he continues - they will not only own the apartments, but also real commercial activities on the street free of charge. Passed off as cultural associations ».
2669	9	Will the building occupied for 20 years be regularized for those who illegally occupy the lodgings?
2669	11	After the Raggi junta, which proved to be totally conniving with this abusive occupation, Gualtieri did not miss the opportunity to give his friends a little gift. After all, he had already openly declared that one of his objectives would have been to regularize those who illegally occupy the lodgings. He defined it as a necessary gesture to restore dignity to those who, without asking permission, occupy houses and buildings, taking possession of them to the detriment of the legitimate owners. Which then makes one wonder what dignity those who perform such gestures lose, to the point of having to be returned to them…
2669	12	Gualtieri and housing for squatters: the building and a center to be used for public construction
2669	14	In this the left has never made a secret of supporting and foraging illegality, professing the Gospel of integration and indiscriminate acceptance. The occupied building in Via del Porto Fluviale was among those to be cleared. The building will be restored and transformed into lodgings to be used for public housing. We already know who the houses will be for. To multi-ethnic families who will have absolute precedence over thousands of Italians who regularly wait for accommodation to be assigned.
2669	15	With immigrants climbing the ranks…
267	3	"The right-wing extremist: ""The EU's climate strategies, the 'Farm to fork' strategy and all the rules that risk limiting our ability to respond to the crisis should be reviewed immediately"" Giorgia Meloni, right-wing extremist and granddaughter of Trump and Bolsonaro, who with their predatory recipes have contributed to spoiling the planet even more."
267	4	"“The EU's climate strategies, the 'Farm to fork' strategy and all the rules that risk limiting our ability to respond to the crisis should be reviewed immediately. All the more reason for greater flexibility in the implementation of the Next Generation Eu and therefore in the use of the resources of our Pnrr, which must be destined for the most part to support the strategic sectors in crisis""."
267	5	"Giorgia Meloni proposes it in an intervention on Corriere della Sera. “On the energy issue, after years of ideological environmentalism espoused by the EU Commission, we are once again talking about gas and the need to diversify its suppliers to limit our dramatic dependence. We have been calling for it for some time, since well before the war, but more incisive action is also needed to curb the cost of the bills that are strangling families and businesses"". “Even on the food crisis, the Commission seems to have overcome some environmentalist dogmas by freeing thousands of hectares inexplicably held fallow, but much remains to be done on financial support for a sector on which another important slice of our sovereignty and our very survival depends ”."
2670	1	NATO puppet Stoltenberg pushes war against Russia
2670	3	NATO puppet Stoltenberg, installed by the US, always pushes war against Russia
2670	5	Last week, after meeting with top Biden regime officials, including the White House imposter, US-installed NATO stooge Stoltenberg called for a “long-range war of attrition” against Russia in Ukraine .
2670	7	"At the State Department last week, he pushed for a greater strengthening of the war alliance's ""deterrence and defense"": his war on humanity by other names."
2670	9	"Coupled with the proxy war against Russia, his call to ""work even more closely with (alliance) partners (sic) in the Asia-Pacific and other like-minded partners (sic) around the world"" is likely to face China in a similar way in the future."
2670	11	"Ignoring the reality on the ground in Ukraine, he falsely claimed that Russia's SMO was ""a strategic error (sic),"" dubiously adding:"
2670	13	Moscow “underestimated the strength, will and ability of the Ukrainian people (sic), the Armed Forces of Ukraine to defend themselves (sic).”
2670	15	Separately in the Pentagon with US Secretary of War Austin, both of them gratuitously pounded on Russia, pretending that the NATO war alliance has solid unity.
2670	17	Stoltenberg's visit to Washington was about plotting the next moves by US-dominated NATO against Russia.
2670	19	Interviewed by WaPo, he said the following:
2670	21	"Things in Ukraine ""could drag on for a long time."""
2670	23	The US/NATO regimes are pouring arms and ammunition into its territory with this goal in mind.
2670	25	As indicated by his US master, Stoltenberg supports the unattainable idea of ​​expelling Russian forces from the Donbass and regaining Kiev's control of Crimea.
2670	27	"Nazi Ukraine ""has the right to say it (is) fighting"" all over the territory it seeks its control over (sic), he sighed."
2670	29	Ignoring Vladimir Putin's publicly stated SMO goals, he falsely accused Russia of pursuing revanchist goals in less than words, despite no evidence to suggest it.
2670	31	Separately on Russian TV Rossyia 1, Vladimir Putin addressed the growing food crisis conditions, falsely accused of his policies, saying:
2670	33	"""We are seeing attempts to hold Russia accountable for developments in the global food market and growing local problems."""
2670	35	I have to say this is another attempt to place the blame on someone else - instead of US/Western policies where it belongs.
2670	37	What is happening has nothing to do with Russia.
2670	39	Along with the Fed's money printing spree, the US sanctions the war of liberation in response to Russia's SMO responsible for rising inflation, disrupting supply chains and food crisis conditions.
2670	41	Russia warned US/West, Putin said, adding:
2670	43	"""(When) we launched our operation, (the US-dominated West) started taking steps that aggravated the situation both in the food sector and in the production of fertilizers."""
2670	45	US/Western claims about Russia blocking Ukraine's grain exports are fake news.
2670	47	Putin, Lavrov and other Russian officials have briefed the US and the West that the only obstacle to shipping Ukrainian grain by sea is for the US-controlled regime to clear its offshore waters.
2670	49	Russia has ensured the safe passage of ships to and from Ukraine once demining is complete.
2670	51	Ukrainian grain can also be exported through Romania and Hungary.
2670	53	The easiest way by land is through Belarus.
2670	55	Right now, Putin explained that “vessels are stuck in Ukrainian ports,” adding:
2670	57	These are foreign ships, by the dozen.
2670	59	They are simply locked up and their crews are still being held hostage by Kiev, on orders from the Biden regime.
2670	61	It has produced conditions of food crisis, which continues with shortages and rising prices.
2671	3	"For Turkish President Erdogan, the Istanbul talks represented his ideal stage. The times when the finger was pointed at his politics in Europe seem long gone. Just a year ago he was called a ""dictator"" by Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Today, however, he is the one to take the stage to favor peace talks. And he is the one who can afford to utter the phrase ""peace has no losers"". Erdogan's ""coup"" at a political level appears remarkable. By facilitating negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, he has regained the credit slowly lost in recent years at an international level and has achieved one of his objectives launched at the dawn of his government adventure, which began 20 years ago: that of giving Turkey an important political position ."
2671	4	Turkey's diplomatic work
2671	6	"Ankara was among the first, on the morning of February 24, to condemn the Russian action in Ukraine. An unexpected position. If on the one hand Turkey is a member of NATO, constituting the second most important army of the Atlantic Alliance, on the other hand the relations between Erdogan and Putin in recent years have been extremely collaborative. A convenient alliance between Turkey and Russia, born on a very specific date: July 16, 2016, a day that probably always echoes in the mind of the Turkish leader. That is the night of the failed coup against him, of the tanks roaming the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, of his speech on Facebook connected from some hiding place, before returning safely only in the late morning. Since then, the ""sultan"" has gradually greeted the West, guilty in his opinion of not supporting him enough, instead embracing Putin's Russia, who on the contrary was among the first to condemn the coup."
2671	8	From that moment on, the two have worked side by side, albeit from different positions, in Syria and Libya as well as in the energy sector, given that since January 2020, Russian gas has been passing from the Turkish subsoil through the pipes of the Turkish Stream. It is therefore difficult to think of a condemnation by Erdogan of Putin's action. However, Turkey has decided to align itself in this sense with the position of NATO. But, at the same time, he chose an autonomous path. In fact, Ankara has not closed ties with the Kremlin, has not joined the rain of sanctions against Russia, has not severed diplomatic lines with the Moscow government. At the same time, it provided political support to Kiev and legitimized Ukraine's defensive action. In this way Erdogan was able to continue working with Putin, with whom he should meet in the next few days. But, at the same time, he has secured the trust of Zelensky and the Ukrainian government. And so in the last few hours in Istanbul both Russians and Ukrainians have given credit to the Turkish diplomatic work, with Erdogan who has been able to boast the role of true peacemaker.
2671	9	The prospects for dialogue mediated by Ankara
2671	11	"Come to think of it, Erdogan's was not a diplomatic ""masterpiece"". The Turkish president has simply done his job and performed his duties to the fullest. That is, those of a head of state who, at the moment of the outbreak of a conflict between two countries with which he maintains good relations, prefers to activate diplomacy and leave belligerent tones aside. Before him, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tried it. But if the latter's trip to the Kremlin a few days after the start of the conflict did not prove decisive, Turkey's work behind the scenes of the war has borne its first fruits. First with the meeting between the two Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers, which took place on March 10 in Antalya, now with the summit between the two delegations in Istanbul. A work ""in crescendo"" that pushes Turkish diplomacy to go further and to attempt the decisive blow: that of a direct meeting between Putin and Zelensky."
2672	3	Cornwall (UK) – Finally some good news – contained in one of the documents drawn up during the G7 that has just ended – which will silence, hopefully at least for a few months, the usual climate catastrophists: next summer, now upon us, will be ( relatively) fresh.
2672	5	"Not only that: it will be the least hot summer of the next 50 years. This is in fact the conclusion reached by the research group commissioned by the G7 to draft the climate document. Prof. Arturo Orutra, head of the team, explained: ""All the data lead to confirm a progressive, gradual and unstoppable increase in temperature from year to year, which not even the significant reductions in human activity generated by the pandemic have been able to slow down. So we can say, with reasonable certainty, that the temperatures of the next 50 years will certainly be higher than this year's. What is about to begin, therefore, will be the summer with the mildest temperatures among those under analysis“. And the good news doesn't end there: according to the prudent estimate of prof. Orutra, next summer is also very likely to be colder than the next fifty. The trend could even be confirmed for the next decades."
2672	7	A study certainly against the tide, which instead of looking nostalgically at the past (as almost always happens in these cases) is instead projected with optimism towards the future.
2672	9	But despite the reassuring conclusions reported in the document, the G7 has made important commitments on the climate, such as that of setting the next summits in Iceland and Greenland to stay cooler and hit the bottom of those who do not reduce emissions before the extinction of mass.
2673	3	To understand the invasion in progress, it is good to remember what asylum seekers hosted in Rome said to a group of citizens some time ago.
2673	5	In the Aurelio district, the initiative of the 'civic sentinels' had recently come to life, made up of resident citizens who, by night, organizing themselves into groups, wanted to peacefully retake possession of their neighborhood.
2673	7	"""We are in solidarity with the citizens of Goro - said the organizer of the 'patrols', Giannini, it was at the time of the Goro events - This hospitality is now an endless business, managed in the transit phase towards the coasts and embarkation on boats by local mafias and then once in Italy the management of profits passes to the cooperatives. This traffic comes to trample on the rights of Italians in order to continue earning. We need to stop this invasion and think about helping them in their own countries”."
2673	9	"During the checks, the 'Civic Sentinels' met the migrants guests of the hotel for refugees in their neighbourhood: ""Their average age is 20, they are males, coming from Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria, all countries where there is no no conflict. Their demands: better clothes and cash to spend."""
2673	11	"When asked by one of the citizens who wanted to know why they decided to come to Italy, ""they replied 'in our country we know that in Italy we are given everything'""."
2673	13	They did it when the Democratic Party was in government. And they are doing it again now that the Democratic Party has returned to government for the fourth time in six years without a popular mandate.
2674	1	Why do people eat meat even though it affects the planet and their health too?
2674	3	We know that today's meat and dairy industries harm our planet and that eating too much animal protein can be bad for our health. So why do we still eat meat?
2674	5	Humans have eaten meat since prehistoric times, but in the last 50 years alone, global meat production has quadrupled to about 350 million tonnes a year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). ).
2674	7	By 2050, world meat production is expected to reach 455 million tonnes.
2674	8	INEFFICIENT FOOD SOURCE
2674	10	"Scientists have long expressed concern about the environmental impact of eating meat, especially industrially produced meat, because it requires more energy, water and land than any other food source, making it ""inefficient""."
2674	12	A study on the environmental impact of agriculture revealed that beef production is responsible for six times more greenhouse gas emissions and 36 times more land use than the production of plant proteins.
2674	13	Therefore, avoiding meat and dairy products is the best way to reduce our environmental impact on the planet, the study concludes. The global exploitation of agricultural land could therefore be reduced to over 75%.
2674	14	PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT
2674	16	Dr Benjamin Buttlar, a social psychologist at the University of Trier, believes that many people eat meat according to learned cultural habits.
2674	17	"“I think a lot of people just enjoy the taste of meat. And the other problem is the identity of the food. Many traditional cuisines revolve around certain meat dishes,” she told DW, adding that we often don't even question what we have: “Most of the time, these habits keep us from thinking that eating meat is really bad, because it's something we do all the time."""
2674	19	Another important aspect is that when we eat meat, we don't associate it with animal suffering. Only when we talk to vegetarians, vegans, or when we see a documentary on animal welfare, do we justify it by saying that man has been eating meat since time immemorial.
2674	21	"Especially men are more justified in eating meat by saying that it is a natural, normal and necessary part of our diet. Buttlar explained ""that there are more young women who want to be vegetarians than men, because eating meat remains a male stereotype, responding to the image of strong men who hunt, and is linked to evolutionary misconceptions about meat consumption."""
2674	22	THE HYPOTHESIS “MEAT HAS MADE US HUMAN”.
2674	24	For a long time, researchers believed that eating meat helped our ancestors develop more human-like physical characteristics, and consuming meat and bone marrow provided Homo erectus with the energy it needed to grow and feed a bigger brain.
2674	26	But a new study has questioned the priority of meat consumption in our evolution. The authors of this research argued that although archaeological evidence of meat-eating increased with the emergence of Homo erectus, this was perhaps because the subject was studied extensively and more bone-eaten remains were sought. man at that time.
2674	27	eADV
2674	29	“I was definitely very surprised by this discovery,” Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of the study, told DW. 'Homo erectus evolved because meat consumption increased, so these discoveries forced me to rethink my perception of our evolutionary history.'
2674	30	Currently, 75% of the world's food comes from 12 plant and five animal species. But if we consume too much of a single food source, it can cause health problems.
2674	32	“Countless studies show that consuming animal protein is linked to the development of a variety of cancers,” Dr. Milton Mills, an internist and critical care specialist in the United States, told DW.
2674	34	Mills, an advocate of plant-based diets and founder of a plant-based diet website, disagrees that vegetarians and vegans lack certain proteins and nutrients.
2674	36	“Those theories arose 50 or 60 years ago when people mistakenly believed that meat was somehow more nutritious than vegetables. It was a misconception that people had, that there are only certain amino acids that can be obtained from animals. And that's not entirely true,” Mills pointed out.
2674	38	If the world's population continues with its current appetite for meat, it will no longer be able to meet the demand for food in 2050, when there will be nearly 10 trillion people on the planet.
2674	40	"But how can global meat consumption levels be reduced? “For example, making meat products as expensive as they should be for animal welfare and, cost-wise, for the climate. And make the alternatives cheaper,” says Benjamin Buttlar. It's also important for people to have positive cooking experiences with vegetables, he says. Instead of saying ""you shouldn't eat meat,"" people should be encouraged to try different dishes without meat products, he explains."
2675	1	Greta and Carola: bombs on ideologies
2675	3	"Liberals believe that it is very difficult to plan the behavior of individuals from above: they do not believe in enlightened decision-makers. And when states and governments allow themselves to be overcome by this ambition, they fail spectacularly. It is a corollary of the so-called ""heterogeneity of ends"": that institution tries to do A and gets its opposite B. The Russian president has just argued that Europe and the West are in decline and he would have taken it upon himself to strike the blow the final. In an incredible paradox, precisely liberal, Putin could be right about our state of health, but at the same time his behavior could save us."
2675	5	And not for the lie, built in the press, for which Europe today would finally be united. It is not at all, as is clear with regard to the ups and downs on sanctions. And even if it were, it is not clear why this would, in itself, save the West.
2675	7	"No, Putin is saving us because he is destroying two corrosive myths of the West in general, and of Italy in particular. Putin is ""killing"" - in addition to the Ukrainians - also two icons of our conformism: Greta and Carola. The climatist in whose presence the West has knelt and the Capitana who decides the immigration policy in Italy and in Europe, according to the laws of her NGO."
2675	9	Let's start with the second. The Ukrainian case has clearly demonstrated how Europe, even the one described as hard and narrow-minded like conservative Poland, is not at all hostile to immigration: we have welcomed millions of Ukrainians without making a protest. Millions of women and children: their men instead stayed at home to fight. Not exactly the show we see on the boats of the various Carolas crowding the Mediterranean. Anyone fleeing a war is welcomed, without protest.
2675	11	"But even Greta has been put back in the drawer of history. The West is realizing how much we depend on cheap energy. Coal, nuclear, drilling and of course renewables all have to come together to produce the energy that has made us prosperous. The more the war situation worsens, the more Europe realizes how necessary the so-called ""technological neutrality"" is: all the sources are good to advance our model of development."
2675	13	Nobody wishes the war to last long of course. But the longer it lasts, the more we will realize how much climate and immigration ideology are precisely ideologies: Marxisms of the new millennium.
2676	3	"The ""Putinians of Italy"". A list, quite full-bodied, in the sights of Copasir, as also reported by Il Giornale together with other mainstream newspapers."
2676	4	Putinians of Italy, beware!
2676	6	Instruments of Russian propaganda, which exists only if it comes from Moscow and, please, does not concern the free and democratic West. That West where everyone is free to express their opinion without being subject to investigation...or rather not. Considering that Copasir, the Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic, apparently does the investigation, and even blurts it out in the national press.
2676	8	"He directs it towards those who, in a Manichaean manner, are defined as ""Putinian"". What Putin means then is another mysterious affair. Is not giving all reason to the West Putinian? Is it Putinian to remark on the path that led to the war in Ukraine? Is claiming that our interests aren't exactly those of fueling the conflict between Kiev and Moscow Putinian? Is it Putinian to defend companies and workers who risk collapse due to the prices of foodstuffs, those of energy sources, the galloping inflation that this war is producing? If the undersigned thinks of the many families that could end up in the middle of a road due to the absurd expansionism of Washington, is it Putinian?"
2676	9	Watch out, dissidents, the Copasir is watching you
2677	3	"A random place in the world (Russia, sooner or later) – The President of a State, who asked to remain anonymous (both the President and the State), reported that, during a telephone conversation with Vladimir Putin while they were at lunch together, the Russian President would have explained to him that: ""The Ukraine operation is only the beginning of an extensive series of targeted interventions aimed at denazifying the entire aquatic globe""."
2677	5	The list of states to be denazified currently includes:
2677	7	- Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland where there are radical far-right movements, whose presence Russia is certain of having financed;
2677	8	- Switzerland, because the symbol in its flag could resemble a swastika without a hooked part;
2677	9	- Illinois, known den of Nazis;
2677	10	- all states that daily endanger Russia's security by bordering us (the list may increase over the years, due to the natural expansion of Russia's borders).
2677	12	Furthermore, Putin is said to have come into possession of a worrying report according to which the government of an important Eurasian country is assuming neo-Nazi characteristics.
2677	14	Also according to the report, the country in question would have woven a network with far-right parties around the world. His government also allegedly amended the Constitution several times in an authoritarian sense, prevented any form of dissent, ordering the persecution and arrest of demonstrators, journalists, political opponents and also ordering their poisoning.
2677	15	Furthermore, in recent decades, the country has been affected by an escalation of terrorism attributable to far-right groups with numbers far superior to the rest of the world.
2677	17	And not only that: recently, this country has even militarily occupied territories belonging to other sovereign states, on the basis of pseudo-historical and ethnic claims, and moreover by entrusting part of the operations to a private militia headed by an avowed neo-Nazi.
2678	3	Michael Shellenberger is an award-winning ecologist in the field who at some point broke away from the CO2 extremism, global warming scare, and started writing the truth.
2678	5	Now he asked: how did Germany, an advanced country, find itself a slave to Russia, with 40% of its gas, 20% of its coal and oil imported from Moscow and thus having lost its political autonomy? Here's how Schellenberg answers the question:
2678	7	How is it possible that European countries, and in particular Germany, have allowed themselves to become so dependent on an authoritarian country in the 30 years since the end of the Cold War?
2678	9	"Here's how: These countries are gripped by a delusional ideology that renders them incapable of understanding the stark reality of energy production. Green ideology insists that we don't need nuclear power and that we don't need fracking. He insists that it is only a matter of willingness and money to switch to all renewables and quickly. He insists on the need for a ""degrowth"" of the economy and on the impending ""extinction"" of man. (I know well, I myself was once a true believer)."
2678	11	"John Kerry, the US climate envoy, captured the short-sightedness of this view perfectly when he said, in the days leading up to the war, that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “could have a profound negative impact on the climate, obviously . There is a war, and obviously the consequences of war will be massive in terms of emissions. But just as importantly, people's attention will be lost."""
2678	13	"But it was precisely the West's focus on healing the planet with ""soft"" renewables and abandoning natural gas and nuclear power that allowed Putin to gain a stranglehold on Europe's energy supply."
2678	15	As the West fell into a hypnotic trance about healing one's relationship with nature, preventing the climate apocalypse, and worshiping a teenage girl named Greta, Vladimir Putin made his moves.
2678	17	"While expanding nuclear power at home so that Russia could export its precious oil and gas to Europe, Western governments were spending their time and energy obsessing over ""carbon footprints,"" a term created by a advertising company working for British Petroleum. They banned plastic straws because of a 9-year-old Canadian boy's science homework. They paid for hours of “weather anxiety” therapy."
2678	19	As Putin expanded Russia's oil production, natural gas production and then doubled nuclear power output to allow for more export of its precious gas, Europe, led by Germany, shut down its nuclear power plants. it closed gas fields and refused to develop more through advanced methods such as fracking.
2678	21	The numbers tell the story better. In 2016, 30% of the natural gas consumed by the European Union came from Russia. In 2018, that figure jumped to 40%. In 2020 it was almost 44% and at the beginning of 2021 almost 47%.
2678	23	"For all his flattering of Putin, Donald Trump, in 2018, defied diplomatic protocol to publicly call out Germany for its reliance on Moscow. “Germany, as far as I'm concerned, is a prisoner of Russia because it gets so much of its energy from Russia,” Trump said. This prompted Germany's then chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had been widely praised in polite circles for being the last serious leader of the West, to say her country ""can make its own policies and make its own decisions."" ”."
2678	25	The result was the worst global energy crisis since 1973, driving up electricity and petrol prices around the world. It is a crisis, fundamentally, of inadequate supply. But scarcity is entirely artificial.
2678	27	Europeans – led by figures like Greta Thunberg and the leaders of the European Green Party and supported by Americans like John Kerry – believed that a healthy relationship with the Earth required scarce energy. By switching to renewable energy, they would show the world how to live without harming the planet. But it was a chimera. It is not possible to power an entire electricity grid with solar and wind energy, because the sun and the wind are inconstant and the current batteries are not even cheap enough to store large amounts of electricity overnight, much less for entire seasons .
268	3	"On the 49th day, the fear that the war in Ukraine will extend for years makes some think that it is necessary to better arm Volodymyr Zelensky's army. After the support of the United States and the United Kingdom, the German one could arrive. Annalena Baerbock, Minister of Foreign Affairs, accepted the Ukrainian request only to have to deal with Erich Vad. Angela Merkel's former political-military adviser, as well as a former brigadier general, said he was completely against it. Vad says he is convinced that this type of deliveries in Kiev are potentially a ""path to the third world war""."
268	4	"Sergej Lavrov himself, Russian Foreign Minister, had warned the West, recalling that ""those who fill Ukraine with weapons are responsible for their own actions"". Furthermore, according to the former general, complex weapon systems such as the Leopard tank or the Marder infantry fighting vehicle can only be operated and used after extensive training. “We are making a lot of rhetoric about the war – he continued according to what was reported by the television station Zdf -. But as we all know, the road to hell is always paved with good intentions. If we don't want a third world war, sooner or later we will have to get out of this logic of military escalation and start negotiations""."
2680	3	"A few weeks ago, after Erdogan's (or Michel?) rudeness to Ursula Geltrud von der Leyen, the new premier Mario Draghi defined the Turkish president as a ""dictator"". Had Giuseppe Conte or Gigi Di Maio done it, we could have thought of a gaffe, one of many in the mouths of people with little experience and a great deal of confusion, for visibility."
2680	5	But with Mario Draghi and the 5 S in rapid dissolution, things have changed: no one can believe that the former President of the European Central Bank really entrusts Italian foreign policy to the ex-drinker Luigi Di Maio!
2680	7	"So why such a strong, yet so thoughtful word? To understand this, we need to take a step back: Biden's victory in the American elections had already marked the end of the Conte government. Various journalist and political friends gave it to me for sure several months earlier: ""If Biden wins, it's over for Conte""."
2680	9	"Why this accurate prediction? It should be remembered that Conte had received public applause from Trump (remember the greetings to ""Giuseppi""?), but above all that the former US president was a fervent isolationist: concentrated on the American economy and its competition with China, Trump had disengaged the USA from the classic continuous American interventions in the affairs of other countries, including Italy."
2680	11	Biden, on the other hand, follows another agenda: the return of US protagonism on the world stage, according to an often aggressive interventionism, typical of the dem and the republican wing that flanked him (the Bushes, Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney…) .
2680	13	"Hence Biden's bombs on Syria, the public insults to Putin, defined as a ""murderer"" (with a certain courage, given that Biden was a supporter of the US wars in Iraq ...), and, a few days ago, the correct but provocative recognition of the Armenian genocide by the Turks."
2680	15	"Here, to understand why Draghi called Erdogan a ""dictator"", just think about this: perhaps someone believes that Biden has recently recognized the tragedy of the Armenians, of a century ago, out of sympathy for that people, or because he craves the historical truth ?"
2680	17	"Come on. History is the field in which exploitation is almost a must, for many politicians. As it is easy to understand, Draghi allowed himself such an aggressive shot at the ""dictator"" because he was well aware of the anti-Turkish attitude of his main sponsor: the USA. Obviously, it is not Biden who followed Draghi in pressing the Turks, but Draghi who anticipated what Biden would do."
2680	19	But let's go back for a moment. Who caused the fall of the Conte bis, preventing a Conte ter? Matthew Renzi! That is, the man who had been the protagonist of the reversal of alliances at the end of the first Conte government, thus favoring the Conte bis! Why this change in front?
2680	21	Let's put the dots together: Renzi was the Italian politician closest to the Obama administration and to Biden himself. He himself made it clear several times, in the days of the election of the new US president.
2680	23	Here we are. Biden becomes president, calls his friend Renzi, and explains to him how things stand: the US is no longer isolationist, and therefore needs Italy, a country that for many reasons is very important for American interests in Europe and the Mediterranean .
2680	25	Renzi, called, obeys, and overthrows the Count, whom he himself had placed on the throne, preventing Salvini and Zingaretti from going to elections.
2680	27	The ball is now in the hands of Mario Draghi, a pro-European yes, but above all an Atlanticist, and former Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs.
2680	29	Draghi, for the new administration, is a certainty: he is a trusted man, authoritative after so much amateurism, not compromised, like Conte, with China. Furthermore, he can collaborate very well with France to stem the German dominance in Europe. An excessive power not appreciated by Donald Trump, even though he is also of German origins, and which the Biden administration does not like either.
2680	31	"To better understand, let's pick up the highly authoritative geopolitical magazine Limes. The March 2021 issue, released before Draghi and Biden's attack on Turkey, is entitled: ""What do we need Draghi for?""."
2680	33	"Among the essays hosted, there is one that is interesting for us. That of Fabrizio Agnocchetti, entitled: ""The Keynesian wind of Washington realigns France and Italy against the follies of Germany"". This is the subtitle: “The US no longer tolerates German Europe, infiltrated by China. The anti-liberal turn of Macron and Draghi takes advantage of the new course…”."
2680	35	"What is happening then? The EU built by Germany, China's first trading partner, to its own measure, use and consumption, does not please the Americans, it looks too much like a ""Fourth Reich""."
2680	37	Now that Angela Merkel is now at the end of her mandate and no German leaders worthy of her are in sight, the US is aiming for a more protagonist France and Italy.
2680	39	Italy, in particular, by tradition and weakness, can be the most faithful partner, the American bridgehead in Europe.
2680	41	But let's go back to Turkey, with which Germany has maintained a very strong relationship since the times of the First World War and from which it is now asking, behind generous economic compensation, to curb Syrian immigration: an ally of Germany, it has ended up in the crosshairs, in order, of Macron, of Draghi, and, finally, of President Biden.
2680	43	Perhaps the reader will have noticed, in fact, that Erdogan's rudeness to Ursula, amplified by some (Italy), was minimized, for a certain period, precisely by Ursula herself and by Germany!
2680	45	And now? We will see if we are faced with a newfound Italian protagonism, with US cover, in the Mediterranean (where the Turks are rampant, also thanks to the crazy Libyan war also wanted by the US of H. Clinton and our Napolitano), and, at the same time, to a new protagonism of our country also in the EU.
2681	3	"He waited a week, leaving his aides and members of government to reply. But yesterday he did not hold back and decided to use heavy words against Mario Draghi, guilty of having called him a ""dictator"". Turkish President Recep Tayyp Erdogan did not mince words with the Italian head of government, which demonstrates how diplomatic relations between Rome and Ankara are still in crisis."
2681	5	"""The Italian prime minister's statements are totally indecent and rude,"" said the Turkish president during a meeting with young people in an Ankara library. ""Precisely in a period in which we hope that relations between Italy and Turkey can reach an excellent level, this gentleman named Draghi, by releasing this statement, has unfortunately affected our relations"", he added. But that's not enough: ""You reached your position by appointment, you certainly didn't get where you are through elections,"" he said, almost pointing his index finger. «Before you can use these words towards Tayyip Erdogan, you should first of all have an awareness of history, but we understand that you don't have it. We, thanks to the strength that the people have given us, having taken over this popular will, will continue our journey at the service of the nation""."
2681	7	"Words like boulders, which will hardly be able to close this chapter without consequences. But diplomacy is at work, there are too many interests linking Turkey and Italy even if, at the same time, there are geopolitical issues which have recently made Ankara a competitor of Italy on several fronts. Starting with Libya, where Draghi has relaunched the Italian presence while Turkey, in addition to having sent a military contingent, has increased its influence by forging close relations with the Tripoli government. Not to mention the open question on natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Eni and Total have started drilling in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus. Ankara demands its share of resources even without having the right to them and has unleashed a diplomatic conflict with the European Union. The first tensions began in 2018, when some Turkish warships blocked the exploration of the Saipem 12000 ship, owned by ENI. After Cyprus accused Ankara of violating international law, the European Union launched a series of sanctions and restrictive measures against Turkey. In these scenarios, as can be seen, relations are a bit turbulent and the distant barbs between the Italian and Turkish leaders have certainly not helped to calm them down. And to think that it all began last April 6, with the famous ""sofa-gate"", i.e. the meeting of the president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the leader of the European Council, Charlel Michel, with the Turkish president at Ankara. In the sumptuous presidential palace, Von der Leyen was left without a chair and had to make do with a distant sofa, while Erdogan and Michel had taken seats of honor next to each other. Two days later, commenting on the embarrassing situation created in Ankara, Draghi said: «With these dictators, let's call them what they are, but they are needed, one must be frank in expressing one's diversity of views and visions of society. And he must also be ready to cooperate, indeed, to collaborate to ensure the interests of his country. You have to find the right balance."" Words that had infuriated Turkey, so much so as to push Ankara's Foreign Ministry to summon our ambassador Massimo Gaiani. And yesterday the matter was enriched by a new act with the first person intervention of Erdogan."
2682	1	Germany, the green lady on the grill, the dream of the chancellery is fading away
2682	3	The green party is in free fall, going from 28% to 19% because of the gaffes of the leader Baerbock, who loses the magic touch
2682	5	"Burning eleven points of consensus in the first weeks of the electoral campaign is not an exciting result. And today many are wondering whether choosing her as candidate for chancellor was the right choice: Annalena Baerbock is on the grill. Last April 19, the Grünen entrusted her with the role of ram head towards the elections of September 26: not an easy choice. For a few weeks, the ecologists had considered bringing in the other co-president of the party, that 56-year-old Robert Habeck who had at least some previous experience as minister of the environment in a Land. The choice fell on the youngest (40 years old), smiling and inexperienced Annalena who, indeed, proudly claimed her CV as a party technocrat, who has always been far from any button room, ""we want to innovate the way of doing politics in Germany »."
2682	7	A little over two months after the call to the polls, it is clear that inexperience does not pay. Partly because Angela Merkel remains the political personality most loved by the Germans. And if it is true that in recent months some exponents of her party (the CDU) have become entangled in some unedifying stories of bribes on orders for antiviral masks, the sovereignist party Alternative für Deutschland is enough to condense the resentment of anti-politics .
2682	9	Partly because Annalena with a clean face has speared a series of gaffes that have transformed the initial enthusiasm for choosing a female candidate into a flash in the pan.
2682	11	"The day after his candidacy, the Grünen hovered around 29% of the votes, even surpassing the Cdu led by the little charismatic Armin Laschet, today the ecologists have fallen to 18%, closely followed even by the Social Democrats, a party in historic crisis of consensus. Worse still, on 1 July Infratest Dimap asked a sample of Germans who they would like to be the next chancellor: Baerbock came only fourth with 18% of the preferences after 29% assigned to the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, 28% to the moderate Armin Laschet and 25% who answered ""I don't know""."
2682	13	"Annalena, in other words, does not attract a single undecided voter or voter from another party, settling only on the hard core of the Greens. Her faults are not serious but her repeated mistakes have opened the eyes of many Germans. In the first place, her curriculum vitae was ""embellished"" in the academic studies and membership of international organizations sections, ""oversights"" for which the chancellor candidate apologized to the voters. Then it was her turn to make some belated declarations to the German tax authorities regarding some bonuses received by the party: nothing illegal but not a good calling card."
2682	15	"The latest news concerns his book ""Now: how we will renew our country"", with numerous citations and references to the original authors. Another mistake that has allowed the popular Bild to put the author in the pillory, forcing a distracted party to hire lawyers to defend her from the accusation of plagiarism. The publisher has announced that she will publish a new version of the book including the ""lost"" references in the first edition."
2683	3	"The American magazine Foreign Policy reports that Germany is conducting secret negotiations with Russia and is ready to neglect assistance to Ukraine, denouncing the ""humiliation"" of the Russian Federation."
2683	4	Journalist Konstantin Pridybaytold readers of Journalistskaya Pravda why EU countries are changing the vector of their foreign policy.
2683	6	“We can observe what is happening now with European countries, including the attitude of Ukraine's participation in the armed confrontation. Three days ago, in Poland, Italy, Germany and other European countries, concessions were canceled for so-called Ukrainian refugees, who left on the first day in expensive cars. European officials paid attention to what Ukrainians cost them, and, apparently, for some, their own citizens turned out to be more important, which, of course, pleases.
2683	7	The same goes for arms supplies. Ukraine is constantly asking, but it is promised or not promised. In general, European and American officials have begun to understand that Ukraine is costing them dearly and they are not getting any good out of it, and they will understand this in the future. Now they are reconsidering their attitude, in a week and a half we hear, as the officials of the European Union and the high-ranking US military talk about the need to sit down at the negotiating table. And even the fact that Ukraine will not achieve anything, it is not worth fighting for some land, if Russia wants to get part of the territory of Ukraine, as they say in plain text, there is nothing wrong with that Ukraine must agree.
2686	3	"«It is time to call things with their proper name: to recognize the status of refugee to those who are really fleeing the war, taking the opportunity to repatriate those who are not refugees. Will the images of these hours finally be able to make the left understand the difference between ""economic migrants"" and real refugees? Giorgia Meloni writes it in a post on Facebook entitled ""The real difference between refugees and illegal immigrants explained to the left"". The leader of the Brothers of Italy also publishes an excerpt from yesterday's speech in the Chamber during communications on the war in Ukraine."
2686	4	"Meloni: ""The Ukrainians living in Italy are honest workers"""
2686	6	«To welcome a community that in Italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules. The Ukrainians who are here in Italy are honest workers », underlines the leader of the Brothers of Italy. She who then adds: «When the left had an identity, it would have defined them like this. Today they call them waiters and carers. And I say this with respect to the category of waiters. I have seen many more waiters among certain journalists than in all the Ukrainian people».
2686	8	"""When there is a war, it is women and children who flee"""
2686	10	"""When there is a war, it is the women and children who flee and the men tend to stay and fight"". And then the attack. «Here for years – Giorgia Meloni points out – we have been told that there was the drama of refugees faced with images of boats full of lonely men of working age. The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies. And coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants, which nations are the first to provide assistance? The very bad Eastern countries: first of all Poland and Hungary, threatened and insulted for years by the left, by the European Commission, by the mainstream media. If there was a bit of intellectual honesty in this courtroom too, someone would have to repent""."
2687	1	Super-environmental Germany forced to return to coal.
2687	3	Climate-crazy Germany is now forced to burn more coal for energy after Russia drastically cuts the country's gas supply.
2687	5	Despite the country's obsession with climate decisions, Germany has announced it will be forced to rely more on coal for its electricity supply after Russia cuts back on the amount of gas it will supply to the country.
2687	7	This left the Central European state in a very precarious situation with regards to energy security, a situation that was predicted by former US President Donald Trump in 2018 due to the country being overly dependent on energy exports provided by Moscow.
2687	9	While Trump was mocked for his warning at the time, the former US head of state appears to have been vindicated, with an article published Sunday by Deutsche Welle reporting that the systematic reduction in the amount of gas supplied by Russia has left the Germany facing a potential energy crisis.
2687	11	As a result, Germany will now be forced to ration gas while increasing its reliance on coal – pace environmentalists – for electricity generation.
2687	13	“To reduce gas consumption, less gas needs to be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will instead have to be used more,” said German Greens Minister Robert Habeck as he announced the new measures.
2687	15	“It is bitter, but in this situation it is simply necessary to reduce gas consumption,” he continued, referring to the fact that his nation had aimed to lead the coal phase-out to better meet its climate goals.
2687	17	One form of power generation that was not mentioned by the minister, however, was nuclear, although the low-carbon method of power generation is expected to be completely phased out in Germany by the end of the year.
2687	19	The country's green-obsessed government began phasing out earlier this year, and while it was initially thought that at least some of the decommissioned plants could be reactivated to combat the energy insecurity caused by the disruption of relations between Russia and the western West, such a move had previously been rejected by Habeck himself.
2687	21	"“We have again looked very carefully whether longer operation of nuclear power plants would help us in this foreign policy situation,” the minister said earlier. ""The answer is negative: it would not help us."""
2687	23	Meanwhile, one of Germany's Green coalition partners, the Freie Demokratische Partei, has suggested the country review its ban on fracking, apparently in the hope that technology can remedy the current situation.
2687	25	"""As scientific studies show, fracking does not cause any significant environmental damage according to modern safety standards,"" said a party official. ""It should therefore be seriously examined whether increased shale gas production is economically and technically feasible in Germany."""
2688	3	"The Justice Committee of the House has given the green light to decriminalize the cultivation of cannabis at home, to the extent of four seedlings. The bill, according to the rapporteur Mario Perantoni of the M5S, should have the effect of ""supporting those who use it therapeutically"" and of ""removing ground from drug dealing"". But the text also provides for the halving of the penalties for ""minor"" drug dealing. So, on balance, rather than taking away ground, it seems to be able to open up new room for maneuver for pushers."
2688	4	What is in the law decriminalizing the cultivation of cannabis at home
2688	6	"For Perantoni, however, even this decriminalization, which reduces the sentence provision for ""mild"" drug dealers from four years to two years and two months, should be noted ""among the innovations that strengthen the structure of the initial project"". The others are the fact that ""the transfer of narcotic substances to minors by adults"" and ""the establishment of a national day on the damage caused by alcoholism, smoking, from the use of narcotic or psychotropic substances to be held at the beginning of the school year in first and second level institutions""."
2688	8	"Penalties halved for ""minor"" trafficking"
2688	10	In short, everything in the framework of the law conveys the idea that, after all, not only smoking cannabis, but also selling some is not so problematic with the only exception of the sale by adults to minors, which guessing it could prove to be an incentive to use ever younger labor for the sale to the very young.
2688	11	"Delmastro: ""The State must fight the drug culture"""
269	3	It is an immigration of parasites, in the etymological sense of the term: entities that do not produce but drain resources from the host. That works for them. This is what is happening in Italy. According to the latest data available, in fact, the residence permits that Italy issues - for example in 2020 there were 239 thousand - are almost all for family reunification or asylum seekers. While only 14,000 were work permits, 40.5% of which were seasonal workers while just 10.6% were highly skilled workers. This means that less than half of the 30,000 places made available by the government have been exploited. And that just over 5% of immigrants come to Italy to work. So: why do we let them in? What the hell are they for? In practice: immigrants in Italy come to be supported, not to work. And this is a process that has been going on for years. So much so that, now, the cost-benefit ratio of immigration in Italy is totally unbalanced on costs.
269	4	Immigrants in Italy are, to date, over 5 million. Excluding the million illegal immigrants, who do not have a residence permit, as they are illegal immigrants and do not pay contributions. Not that the regulars pay them. Most immigrants do not work. It is the component made up of dependent family members. So for reasons of age, or because they are too young, or because they are too old, who do not work, however weighing on our welfare. It is the mistake of allowing entries for family reunification. In France, this policy has completely changed the ethnic landscape of the country. We are making the same mistake.
269	5	And then, of course, there are the unemployed or people who are unemployed and work illegally. Consequently, going to see in detail, only a minority of immigrants have a regular job and really contribute to the wealth of the country. Among immigrants, the employment rate before the lockdown was 57.8%: this means that 42.2% live behind us. An incredibly high figure for those who should be here to 'pay our pensions'.
269	6	Just as the almost 100,000 who still live in reception centers at our expense will not pay for it. There were 200 thousand at the time of the Democratic Party, and now, with the repeal of the Salvini decrees, the same Democratic Party aims to fill them again with Tunisians.
269	7	On the other hand, they gobble up the basic income. One of the points to be reformed is that of reunification: we import fancazzisti who go to create an army of misfits for future banlieus. If we really need working immigrants – very few – then we only let them in, not grandmothers and grandchildren: otherwise it is immigration of repopulation. Of ethnic replacement. But first we have to solve the Pd-M5s problem. A definitive solution is needed. Indeed, it is 'thanks' to these two parties that over 14 percent of the basic income goes to those who are not citizens: immigrants.
269	8	This means that they receive double their incidence on the population. It is as if we paid them to stay in Italy. Forced hospitalization stuff.
2691	3	The failure of Western strategy in the war against Russia is now evident. On the Ukrainian front, the army of Kiev, despite the enormous supplies of weapons and equipment sent by NATO, is now close to collapse, surrounded by Russian forces, what remains of the Ukrainian departments in the Donbass are now trapped in Severodonetsk and Slavyansk, in the Lugansk area and the Donbass region is almost totally under Russian control. The land corridor between Crimea and Donbass is now established and Moscow will not turn back, whether Westerners like it or not.
2691	5	Western sanctions against Russia have not only not led to a weakening of the Russian economy but rather have strengthened it, increasing and multiplying Russia's revenue thanks to the increase in energy prices. The strengthening of the ruble testifies to this effect which is exactly the opposite of what the US and the EU were hoping for.
2691	7	Negative effects of the sanctions also in the food trade sector. Considering that Russia is the largest exporter of grain in this sector and controls a large part of exports not only of grain, but also of cereals, barley, corn, sunflower oil, fertilizers, phosphates, and other staple foods, this has put global supply chains. A boomerang effect for Western countries that thought they were putting Russia in crisis and they put themselves into crisis. The rise in inflation and the rise in prices of everything from energy to food are causing serious problems for the European countries that had decreed sanctions against Russia, adapting to the decisions of the Biden Administration, without assessing the negative consequences that would have resulted.
2691	9	The attempt by Western propaganda to blame Russia for the food crisis, which is instead a direct consequence of Western sanctions and the wickedness of European governments, queued like sheep obedient to Washington's directives, is pathetic. These decisions are taken by a political class that has not cared and has not been able to predict the impact of these measures on their own societies.
2691	11	The consequences of crisis and famine are multiplying like wildfire even in the most fragile countries, from the Middle East to Africa. Social revolts and widespread insecurity are expected with a sharp increase in the immigration of masses of Arabs and Africans driven by hunger towards the European coasts.
2691	13	All the disinformation and fake news about the war and Western propaganda cannot hide the reality that emerges as the weeks go by.
2691	15	The same European exponents are now timidly beginning to admit that the Kiev government, in order to end the war, should make territorial concessions, as Stoltenberg himself (NATO secretary) recently declared. Finding an agreement with Russia becomes a necessity that cannot be put off.
2691	17	It also becomes necessary for the Kiev authorities to recognize the ineluctability of the territorial cessions of Donbass and Crimea which can never again return to Kievan rule, whether Zelensky and his cronies agree or not.
2691	19	A plausible scenario would be for Russia to turn Ukraine into a “frozen conflict” once the current phase of the war reaches the administrative borders of Donbass, and incorporating Kherson.
2691	21	In any case, if a negotiation opens, it will be between Washington and Moscow and the Ukrainian leadership will have to take it or leave it, having no bargaining power in the proxy war waged by NATO against Russia through the Ukrainians.
2691	23	Ukraine itself is a bankrupt and over-indebted country that is on its way to losing its statehood and being broken up into Poland and other countries. The policy of total enslavement to the interests of the Anglo-US, practiced by Zelensky has produced disastrous results for Ukraine and its people who have suffered enormous human losses.
2691	25	"The ""puppet"" of the USA in Kiev will have to answer for it and his dramas, branded Hollyood, will not be enough to save his skin."
2691	27	"For the United States it is a new disaster of foreign policy dictated by the warmongers in Washington. They hoped to weaken and disarticulate Russia but, once again, they were burned by Putin's reaction and counter-move with his ""special operation""."
2692	3	"The Russia-Ukraine war continues to reap victims and destroy. In the last few hours Chernobyl has also been hit during the fighting, as reported to NBC by the adviser to the Interior Ministry of Kiev: ""A nuclear waste storage facility was destroyed in the clashes"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Russian attack on the Chernobyl plant ""a declaration of war against the whole of Europe""."
2692	5	"According to local media reports, Russian troops broke into Ukrainian territory through Belarus, thus entering the Chernobyl zone: ""If Russian artillery strikes destroy the nuclear waste storage facility, radioactive dust could cover the territories of Ukraine, Belarus and the European Union""."
2692	7	"What risks would there be? An eventual accident at the nuclear plant, we read on SkyTg24, could have terrible consequences. The alarm was raised by the American and Russian doctors of the International Physicians for the prevention of nuclear war (Ippnw) in a document published online: ""A humanitarian catastrophe due to the risk of fighting near nuclear plants"" in Ukraine and ""of the escalation towards a nuclear war""."
2692	9	"According to Linda Pentz Gunter, founder of Beyond Nuclear: ""It doesn't matter the genesis, the cause or who started what, the reality is that there are 15 operational nuclear reactors in Ukraine. Whether the reactors are in the middle of a conflict or a war, they cannot simply be abandoned. This requires us to urgently avoid that possibility."" According to experts, the war could lead to a disaster similar to or worse than the Chernobyl reactor meltdown in 1986. Olga Mironova, a Moscow cardiologist and president of the Russian IPPNW, is appealing to all parties to the conflict ""to step back before the abyss"" and to ""persevere with diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions and negotiate a peaceful solution""."
2693	1	The Kremlin clarifies the strategy of Russian forces in Ukraine
2693	3	Russian President Vladimir Putin at the start of the military attack on Ukraine ordered the armed forces to refrain from an immediate assault on the country's cities, including Kiev, in order to prevent heavy casualties among the civilian population, the spokesman of the Kremlin Dmitry Peskov.
2693	5	"Speaking to reporters today, Peskov said planning for the ""military operation"" in Ukraine included considering the strategy of ""armed nationalist formations"" which would deploy weapons in densely populated residential areas."
2693	7	"He apparently refuted the Ukrainian authorities' allegations of indiscriminate bombing of cities, noting that the Russian military ""is working with modern high-precision weapons, targeting only military and IT infrastructure facilities."""
2693	9	“ At the beginning of the operation, the President of Russia indeed instructed the Ministry of Defense to refrain from an immediate assault on large settlements, including Kiev, since armed nationalist formations are equipping firing points, deploying heavy military equipment precisely in residential areas; and fighting in densely populated areas would inevitably lead to heavy civilian casualties,” Peskov explained.
2693	11	"Putin's press secretary revealed that the Russian Defense Ministry ""does not rule out"" the possibility of placing those large settlements that are now almost surrounded, ""under its full control"" to ensure maximum security for the civilian population."
2693	13	"He rejected Western media reports, also denied by Beijing, that Moscow had requested military assistance from China, recalling that Russia ""has the potential to carry out an operation in Ukraine"", that the operation is going ""according to plan ” and will be completed “ on time and in full ”."
2693	15	"When exactly the operation is expected to conclude, Peskov did not say, explaining that such information ""is not disclosed""."
2694	3	"Putin's Russia is preparing ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"" in Ukraine. This is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks to the BBC, proposing an imminent attack by Russia on Ukraine. ""All signs suggest that the plan, in a certain sense, has already started"", the words of the prime minister. Rumors relating to an offensive that would aim to reach Kiev are intensifying. “People need to understand the tremendous cost in human lives,” adds Johnson. Is the attack imminent? “I fear that the reality of the facts indicates it. All signs suggest that the plan, in a sense, has already begun."
2694	4	“Putin will attack Ukraine to rebuild the Soviet Union”
2694	6	"The British Foreign Minister Liz Truss shares the same opinion. Russian President Vladimir ""Putin will not stop in Ukraine"", says the minister during an interview with the 'Mail on Sunday', in which he claims that the Russian president is trying to rebuild the Soviet Union. “This is the most dangerous moment for European security since the 1940s. We have to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Russia has shown that it doesn't take diplomacy seriously,” Truss said."
2694	8	"The West, he continued, must stop Moscow or Putin will try to ""turn the clock back to the mid-1990s or even earlier."" Truss cited the possibility of Russia annexing the Baltic states, such as Estonia and Latvia, and the Western Balkans, which include Serbia and Albania."
2694	9	"US Vice President Kamala Harris: ""We are preparing unprecedented sanctions against Russia"""
2694	11	"The sanctions the United States is preparing against Russia should it invade Ukraine ""are among the largest, if not the largest, we have ever issued."" US Vice President Kamala Harris said this while speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany."
2695	1	Who threatens peace in Ukraine?
2695	3	Cold War propaganda is not nuanced. For months now, all spokesmen in the West have been hammering with one voice that Russia will invade Ukraine, that war is imminent and that we must prepare for it. Old catchphrase!
2695	5	At the time of the East-West confrontation, it was argued in the West that the Soviet threat loomed like the sword of Damocles over the democracies. It was even argued that the USSR's military arsenal was clearly superior to that of the United States, and that it risked exploiting this superiority to invade and subjugate Europe.
2695	7	But it was all wrong. This systemic threat was a fiction. The Soviet arsenal was always inferior to that of its adversaries, and the leaders of the USSR never considered invading Western Europe. Indeed, the arms race was knowingly maintained by Washington the day after the Allied victory over Germany and Japan.
2695	9	Cynically, the Western camp had two good reasons for provoking this competition: the war had worn the USSR down, causing 27 million deaths and destroying 30% of its economic potential, and it had fantastically enriched the USA, which ensured 50 % of world industrial production in 1945.
2695	11	"Boosted by the war, this unprecedented economic supremacy has favored an aggressive foreign policy, self-righteously dressed in the ideological trappings of defending the ""free world"" against ""Soviet totalitarianism"". This imperialist policy, in accordance with the doctrine forged by George Kennan in 1947, had a clear objective: the gradual attrition of the USSR - severely tested by Hitler's invasion - in a military competition in which the Soviet system would squander the means at its disposal to devote to its development."
2695	13	It is clear that this policy has paid off.
2695	15	Overtaken by a Western capitalism that benefited from much more favorable conditions after the Second World War, the Soviet Union finally withdrew from the scene in 1991 after a grueling competition. However, nothing seems to have changed and the Cold War is still going strong: thirty years after the demise of the USSR, Western hostility is not abating.
2695	17	Moscow continues to be credited with bellicose intentions, even though NATO's displays of force on Russia's borders sufficiently illustrate the reality of the Western threat.
2695	19	“From Stalin to Putin”. What could be more ludicrous than this story in which Western good conscience shines through, attributing all the faults to Russia, incriminating an evil power whose resilience would pose an irresistible threat to the supposedly civilized world? This haunting discourse persists in designating present-day Russia as a sort of systemic enemy, as the Soviet evil empire has simply been repainted in Russian colors for the sake of the cause.
2695	21	In the eyes of Western ruling elites, one has to believe that Moscow remains Moscow and that the threat from the east is a permanent feature of Eurasian geopolitics.
2695	23	For those obsessed with the Moscow ogre, Russia is wrong. Not content to threaten Ukraine by massing its armored vehicles on its borders, it also wants to install a pro-Russian power in Kiev.
2695	25	"A singular accusatory reversal, which attributes to Moscow the policy pursued by the West in a country that they have vassalised with subsidies in the hope of transforming it into a future jewel of NATO. Fomenting the February 2014 coup there, they did everything to detach it from its neighbor so as to further isolate Russia, in the wake of these ""color revolutions"" that have been cleverly orchestrated in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus."
2695	27	Since this date, Ukraine has been in the throes of a serious internal crisis, and Moscow has absolutely nothing to do with it. Because the Maidan putsch brought to power an ultra-nationalist clique whose policy humiliated the Russian-speaking population of the eastern regions.
2695	29	This deliberate provocation by the usurping authorities in Kiev, supported by neo-Nazi groups, prompted the patriots of Donbass and Crimea to resist and secede. But there has never been a Muscovite invasion. No Russian tanks are treading on Ukrainian territory, and Moscow has always recommended, to resolve the internal crisis, a negotiated federal solution that spares the interests of the various components of the Ukrainian people.
2695	31	It is surprising to see NATO stigmatize Russia for its policy towards this country, while the only army killing Ukrainians is that of Kiev, which daily bombs the civilian populations of the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.
2695	33	It is the irresponsible aggressiveness of this army, infiltrated by ultranationalists and kept at arm's length by the Western powers, which maintains a climate of confrontation in the region. It is the Western powers' anti-Russian hysteria that is fanning the flames in the region, not the imaginary threat to Ukraine that Atlanticist journalists attribute to Russia.
2695	35	In the current crisis, it is clear that it is the West that poses a threat to peace by outrageously challenging Russia on its borders, and not the other way around.
2695	37	As we know, Moscow does not organize military maneuvers with Mexico or Canada and its war fleet hardly cruises off Manhattan.
2695	39	Washington, on the other hand, continues to encircle Russia by systematically extending NATO's perimeter to its borders. However, this policy violates the commitment made to Mikhail Gorbachev, who accepted the reunification of Germany in exchange for a promise not to extend the Atlantic Alliance towards Eastern Europe.
2695	41	This geopolitical offensive is all the more threatening as it has been accompanied by the installation, on the territory of the new Member States, of an American anti-missile shield. Unthinkable in the days of the USSR, this system posed the threat of a first strike on Moscow and rendered any nuclear disarmament agreement obsolete.
2695	43	Finally, it is impossible to forget the background to this show of strength by the Western camp disguised as a response to the ambitions of the Russian ogre: colossal, the US military budget represents almost half of world military spending, exceeding 740 billion dollars in 2021.
2695	45	Constantly increasing, it is equivalent to nine times that of Russia, a proportion that rises to sixteen times for all NATO member states. Naive fakes aside, who can corroborate the story of an imminent military invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces?
2695	47	Claims that Moscow is preparing war to satisfy its territorial appetites at the expense of its neighbors would deserve a laugh were it not for a grave international crisis in which, once again, Washington's warmongers are trying to stem the irresistible decline of a West vassal.
2696	1	Ukrainian military engineers rebuild the streets in the shape of a Möbius strip and stop the Russian advance
2696	3	KIEV (you still remember where it is, right?) – Almost four months after the start of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian resistance forces are running out of ideas on how to keep public attention high Italian, now grappling with far more urgent issues, such as the latest Stranger Things season, the transfer market and the dreaded swimsuit test which at least this year has been made easier by the lack of carbohydrates on supermarket shelves.
2696	5	"After the ""stop"" to Salvini's mission which for a few days had reported the war story on the front pages of the newspapers, the Ukrainians suffered another blow from Enrico Mentana's decision to interrupt the special newspaper on the war."
2696	7	In an attempt to recover more space in the summer programming schedule, which notoriously prefers lighter tones than those offered by a war that is now too repetitive, a special section of the Ukrainian military genius, led by Colonel E. S. Cher, has created an original an operation that promises not only to rekindle the interest of spectators but could also have the effect of slowing down the enemy advance in the eastern and southern parts of the country.
2696	9	“We have rebuilt the streets bombed by the Russians in the shape of a Möbius strip – says E.S. Cher – In this way, the tanks will continue to make the same path without actually advancing even a kilometer! Not only that: we have placed cameras on all the streets to capture the exact moment in which the Russians will realize they have been duped: images that we will then edit with rhythmic music. Antonio Ricci has promised us a daily strip on Paperissima Sprint!”
2696	11	"The initiative is proving successful among most, but as usual there was no shortage of critical voices. For Toni Capuozzo, the streets in the shape of a Möbius strip would be a fabrication: “Looking closely at the images, I cannot hide the fact that I have strong doubts about their veracity. I don't want to say that they are false, I just want to subtly allude to their falsehood, cloaking my statements under the authority of the former war correspondent but without going to verify in the field"". Also strongly negative is the opinion of Alessandro Orsini, back from the tour of his latest show ""Surrender, Abele!"": ""This new aggressive initiative by the Ukrainian military genius demonstrates what I have been claiming for months now: Ukraine is the only real responsible of the conflict. Rather than accepting defeat once and for all, they prefer to take refuge in topology, resorting to non-orientable surfaces without worrying about the risks that Russian soldiers run in advancing with their heavy vehicles on a road with those singular characteristics and without even bothering to respect the clear prescriptions for the construction of the carriageways set in clear letters by the highway code!”"
2697	1	Obligations and bankruptcies: Omicron will pass, the damages to rights and freedoms will not
2697	3	We recall that the United Kingdom has increased very limited lockdown measures, even in the midst of the last epidemic wave. Even if vaccinations have also been massive across the Channel, vaccination obligations have been minimal and concentrated on some sensitive categories, such as nurses and staff employed in rest homes. Vaccination certificates or health passes were never required for the job.
2697	5	The number of cases in our country is still growing, all despite the introduction of strong limitations on personal freedom and the right to work through the application of the Green pass. The personal rights of Italians have been limited to an extent that has no equal in the world, except in some Central Asian countries. Despite this, the contagion curve is still growing. Not only that, but the latest decree law on the vaccination obligation of fifty-year-olds does not provide for a deadline linked to the number of inoculations, so all citizens are potentially no vax if they do not continue to be inoculated with Omnia saecula saeculorum.
2697	7	Is it possible that no one in the ministries has thought of the obvious problem of putting an end, even temporarily, to the periodic inoculation obligations, which risk repeating themselves every four months for all citizens? Are we sure that citizens will be willing to be injected with an only apparent solution to the problem every four months, without any hesitation or concern for their health? Or is the government preparing to apply Central Asian methods, just to return to the subject, to apply the vaccination obligation?
2697	9	Surely the covid will pass, or will remain in our lives as an endemic disease, such as the flu. Instead, the damage done to citizens' rights and their trust in the institutions will remain forever. Trust is not built with propaganda and beatings, but with coherent and effective acts, carried out with respect for common rights. Unfortunately the Brunetta Speranza government seems to have forgotten about it.
2698	1	Prescient Global Power: Preparing Us for Smallpox
2698	3	News from Spain:
2698	5	Defense has already stored two million smallpox vaccines since 2019
2698	7	The Ministry of Defense has entered into an agreement since July 2019 with the Spanish Medicines and Health Products Agency “for the custody and management of the strategic state deposit of 2,000,000 doses of ACAM 2000 vaccine against the smallpox virus, for carry out its administration in the vaccination process”. According to ministry sources, AEMPS provides the Defense with 100,560 euros a year for the custody of these vaccines, an investment that will be in force until 2023. [….] Agreement signed by Pedro Sánchez's executive three years before the first infections in Spain of the so-called 'monkey virus'
2698	9	English Healthcare has changed the texts on the dangers of monkeypox
2698	11	A few days ago the UK's National Health Service (NHS) edited its Monkeypox page to alter the narrative in a few key ways.
2698	13	"First, they removed a paragraph from ""How do you get Monkeypox?"" section."
2698	15	Up until a few days ago, according to the archived links, the Monkeypox page said this, regarding person-to-person transmission [emphasis added]:
2698	17	It's very rare to get monkeypox from a person with the infection because it doesn't spread easily between people.
2698	19	…this has now been completely removed.
2698	21	Secondly, they removed this paragraph, which was there until at least November 2021 (and perhaps much more recently, there is no archive between November and May) [emphasis added]:
2698	23	[Monkeypox] is usually a mild disease that will get better on its own without treatment. Some people can develop more severe symptoms, so monkeypox patients in the UK are treated in specialist hospitals.
2698	25	The new “treatment” paragraph reads [again, italics added]…
2698	27	Treatment for monkeypox aims to relieve symptoms. The disease is usually mild and most people recover in 2-4 weeks […] You may need to be admitted to a specialist hospital, so that your symptoms can be treated and to prevent the infection from spreading to other people.
2698	29	"So, they remove that ""it will get better on its own"" and still reinforce the idea of ​​spreading the disease despite it being described as ""very rare"" until last week."
2698	31	They even add a line about self-isolation, which has never been mentioned before:
2698	33	since monkeypox can spread if there is close contact, you will need to be isolated if diagnosed.
2698	35	Finally, they now include a warning that you can contract monkeypox from eating undercooked meat, which will no doubt also fuel the anti-meat narrative (oh wait, it already is).
2698	37	To sum up, the story is being rewritten a bit here.
2698	39	"Previously, monkeypox ""didn't spread easily between people."" Now it does."
2698	41	"First, monkeypox ""gets better on its own without treatment."" Now it won't."
2698	43	"It's too early to tell that Monkeypox will be the ""new Covid"", and maybe this launch will stall and be forgotten in a couple of weeks, but there's no doubt they're taking a few hints from the Covid playbook so far."
2698	45	In Italy, the same:
2698	47	Until 19 May 2022, the following sentences were present on the ISS page dedicated to smallpox:
2698	49	“Smallpox vaccination guarantees high immunity against smallpox for 3-5 years, after which the level of protection decreases.”; suggesting that vaccination cannot give lifelong immunity (for obvious reasons and unlike natural immunity).
2698	50	“the vaccine has many side effects”
2698	52	Today we realized that both sentences have been completely removed.
2698	54	Why all this foresight about the return of a virus declared extinct for half a century?
2698	56	Dr. Paolo Gulisano, a doctor, marveling at the strange alarmism of the media on monkeypox, pointed to another case of foresight of Power:
2698	58	"In September 2019, three months before the arrival of Covid-19, the FDA, the American Food and Drug Administration that authorizes drugs, approved a vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. Because in 2019, forty years after the disappearance of this disease, the pharmaceutical industry felt the urgent need to develop such a preparation, rather than dedicating its efforts to less virtual diseases such as Hepatitis C, Tuberculosis, malaria ? The FDA's justification was as follows: “Although the naturally occurring smallpox disease is no longer a global threat, the intentional spread of this highly contagious virus could have a devastating effect. Today's approval reflects the US government's commitment to preparedness through support for the development of safe and effective vaccines, therapies and other medical countermeasures."""
2698	60	"In short, a vaccine is being developed for an extinct disease, which theoretically would be useless, except to defend the population in the event of an ""intentional spread"", i.e. a biological warfare. It is known that of the smallpox, which disappeared from the planet, two strains remained, kept in two maximum security laboratories, one in Moscow and the other in Washington. If smallpox returns, we know for sure where it came from."" At least this."
2699	3	It is Europe's last blow to Italy: keep illegal immigrants for 3 years. As if Italy – the country of first arrival of the migratory wave – should be considered Europe's dumping ground. A gigantic hotspot where to park – for three years – all the immigrants that the NGOs unload on our shores.
2699	5	The brazen and very serious decision of Europe was revealed by the Deputy Minister of European Affairs of France, Clement Beaune. That in an interview with Corriere della Sera regarding the 'mini-summit' on the fight against terrorism in which France, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and the EU took part and to which Italy was not invited - as Giorgia Meloni pointed out – he explained what the EU is preparing behind the backs of the Italians.
2699	7	"“We had a long discussion about how long a country of first arrival should take care of a migrant before responsibility passes to the state of second reception – revealed Clement Beaune. – The Commission proposes three years. I think we are close to finding a balance."""
2699	9	It would mean, precisely, that Italy will become a sort of gigantic hotspot obliged to keep immigrants for three years before we have to obtain redistribution from other European countries. Assuming that, at the end of these three years, the other countries agree to take the immigrants. Which is not at all obvious given the previous ones.
2699	11	“To have clarity on the future of Italy – says Galeazzo Bignami, immigration manager of FdI – we are forced to wait for what the French government says. Which, candidly, states that not only is Italy not an active country on the issue of migrants, unlike other countries including Holland, but also that our nation's destiny is to become a real European hub in which migrants will be able to stay for three years”.
2699	13	“If we had a government with a minimum of backbone, there would be much more to do than a formal protest – Bignami is indignant. – Instead we have a completely impalpable foreign minister. And an Interior Minister whose credibility is at an all-time low.”
2699	15	"""Not only do they not consult us on fundamental issues for our nation, but they even take decisions that will weigh on us"", accuses the immigration manager of Fratelli d'Italia."
