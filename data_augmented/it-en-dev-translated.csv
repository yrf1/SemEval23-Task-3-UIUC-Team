2610	1	OVER 1 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO US SINCE BIDEN IN POWER
2610	3	One can legitimately ask how can a head of state want to assert himself on the battlefields when he is not even able to control his own country? This seems to be the case of Joe Biden grappling with a problem that Americans feel is much more pressing than the conflict in Ukraine. According to a survey carried out by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, in first place in the concerns of Americans there would be inflation (31%), in second place uncontrolled immigration (10%), in third place electoral laws (8%) and only fourth is the conflict in Ukraine (7%). The feelings of the respondents to the polls are certainly not far-fetched, since in fact the Democrat Joe Biden is president of the United States the number of illegal immigrants in the country has increased by 1 million, costing the pockets of citizens 9.4 billion euros dollars. The data was relaunched by the broadcaster Fox News which obtained them from a study by the American Federation for Immigration Reform. Research estimates that there are about 15.5 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, up from 14.5 million in 2020. Other estimates put the number at around 11 million. The American Federation for Immigration Reform's analysis also conducted a study of the tax costs of the phenomenon, finding that illegal immigrants are imposing a net tax burden of at least $143.1 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion. dollars compared to 2020.
2610	4	"According to the study, the reasons for this increase in illegal immigration can be found in three factors. The first is the improvement of the American economy which has attracted hundreds of thousands of immigrants, especially from Latin America. Secondly, the reopening of the borders, expected by many after the health crisis from Covid19. This has poured into the United States a large number of illegal immigrants who were just waiting for Washington to reopen its borders. Finally, perhaps the most important reason, the fact that the Biden administration has canceled most of the laws enacted during the administration led by Donald Trump. To make a quick comparison, between 2016 and 2019 the number of immigrants who became permanent residents dropped by 13%, from 1.18 million to 1.03 million. The geographical area that shows the most this decline is Asia: immigration fell by 21%, from 450,000 to 350,000 people. Again between 2016 and 2019, arrivals from Yemen amounted to -71%; from Iraq to -67%; from Buthan to -63%; from Iran to -53%; from Somalia to -40%; from Pakistan to -29%; from Afghanistan to -16%. These data are the consequence of the travel bans (prohibition of movement) also known as the Muslim bans, the executive orders of President Trump to limit the entry into the United States of potential terrorists from Islamic majority countries. ""President Biden and the people he has appointed to key positions in his administration have pursued the most radical border-opening policies in the history of any sovereign nation, and these new numbers bear it out,"" the Federation for Reform chairman said. immigration officer, Dan Stein, in a statement accompanying the report."
2610	5	The study says the states with the most illegal immigrants are California (3.3 million), Texas (2.2 million), Florida (1.2 million), and New York (1.1 million). The states with the fewest illegal immigrants are North Dakota and West Virginia, with 6,000 each.
26100	1	Milan invaded by the children of freeloading immigrants to maintain
26100	3	Milan cares about poverty. In fact, all welfare goes to immigrants. Not only illegal immigrants, but also working immigrants do underpaid jobs in which they replace Italians precisely because of their availability, and therefore their children must then be supported by the subsidies paid with the taxes of the Italians themselves who may be unemployed because of them.
26100	5	They are almost a thousand. At almost one hundred euros a day they make more than 30 million euros.
26100	7	"“In Milan we have about 950 unaccompanied foreign minors, and they will increase with the summer: very high numbers that make it difficult to give a quality response. Milan is an attraction, a national direction is needed for each local authority to do its part"". This, more than that of the at least eight thousand who arrived in the city from Ukraine, hosted ""90% by families who need to be guaranteed support"", is the urgent problem of ""reception, including education"" reported by the municipal councilor for Welfare Lamberto Bertolè . It is no coincidence that the Municipality froze 49 million in Welfare spending for two months in order to close the budget in the red: each minor immigrant costs twice as much as an adult. Huge numbers."
26100	9	"Providing answers to the ""social malaise"", underlines the Minister of Labor Andrea Orlando, ""is also a way of taking on the difficulties of democracy"". In Lombardy in January over 95,000 families received basic income, for a total of 188,000 beneficiaries; about 23 families and 42,000 people in Milan. “40-50% of RDC recipients in Italy have a work contract – clarifies the minister -. ""Poor work"" is even more dramatic where the cost of living is higher""."
26100	11	They import slaves and then complain about 'poor labour'. Morons.
26104	1	Masks and school: how can you not be indignant?
26104	3	"With the huge crowds in the recent concerts or celebrations in Milan and Rome, the persistence on the use of masks in the school clearly reveals that there is a clear message from the ""best"" towards the new generations. A way to punish and educate them as demonstrated by the famous photo of Draghi and Zaia, strictly without, surrounded by masked elementary school children."
26104	5	"A reflection is required if, as it is almost certain, the ""best"" have not even managed to remove the absurd obligation for the final exams!"
26104	7	No internationally accredited study, to date, has managed to establish a correlation between the obligation of masks in schools and their effectiveness in protecting against covid infections. Even the most recent Danish study was unable to find significant differences in the percentage of infected pupils between school districts with the obligation to wear masks and districts where children can attend without any supervision.
26104	9	"So why deprive our kids of oxygen and freedom of expression, sociality and movement? This was explained by the Undersecretary of Health, Andrea Costa, in a statement that did not arouse the necessary indignation and deserved outcry: ""I don't think the obligation to wear a mask at school is a purely scientific choice, but it is more a political interpretation"" ."
26104	11	Is it, therefore, a sort of educational experiment?
26104	13	"We have already had the opportunity to talk about the psychological bonus as a form of individual psychiatrization of a purely social discomfort, but we had not yet read the shameful, worrying conclusions that emerged from the Sinpia joint conference (Italian Society of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry) and Sinpf (Society of NeuroPsychopharmacology) entitled: ""Clinical psychopharmacology in developmental age: efficacy, safety and implications in later stages of life"" which was held yesterday in Cagliari."
26104	15	"The discomfort of children and adolescents turns into a ""lack of resilience"", which presents the prodromes of a future serious psychiatric pathology, if not treated in time with drugs."
26104	17	Here are some steps:
26104	19	The pandemic has not only increased the cases of psycho-emotional discomfort in young people but has also doubled the accesses of patients to specialized centers and hospitals – explains Alessandro Zuddas, SINPIA Vice-President and professor of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry at the University of Cagliari – . In the absence of adequate social or health support, from the teacher and other non-family reference adults (e.g. sports coach) and from the dramatic decrease in direct interaction with friends and classmates, they exploded into serious manifestations and with them also the drug prescription. In relation to the latter aspect, several critical issues have emerged: for example, the incongruous prescribing choices, oriented towards effective and safe antidepressants or antipsychotics in adults, much less in children and young people.
26104	21	Perhaps after this premise, child neuropsychiatry warns that social discomfort should NOT be treated with drugs? No, ours seems to disregard and abjure state law 180 of 1978, known as the Basaglia law.
26104	23	"In fact, he recommends other ad hoc medicines for children. ""Today, on the other hand, we also have an important therapeutic range for young people, which is certainly effective, as evidenced by literature data. Hence the need for (in)formation between the medical profession and the population, parents and children""."
26104	25	If left untreated, the symptoms persist into adulthood
26104	27	"Claudio Mencacci, Sinpf Co-President and emeritus director of Psychiatry at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, explains that ""the prevalence of these disorders tends to increase with the growth of the child to reach a peak in adolescence and drag on into adulthood. Yes however, he estimates that only half of these disorders are properly diagnosed and that of these only a fifth can be taken care of by Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry services.In addition to the lack of dedicated services, this is aggravated by the persistence of misinformation, taboos and social and cultural stigma that are difficult to break down, with important consequences for the child/adolescent; the frequent condition of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders contributes to complicating the clinical picture and the response to treatments"". And again: ""In short, if it is true that mental disorders in children and adolescents have increased with the pandemic, and that they often lead to acts of self-harm and suicide attempts, it is equally true that an important role is played by parents , who must not hesitate to ask for help but turn to a dedicated expert at the onset of an initial symptom or in the presence of developmental difficulties, to avoid the evolution towards a full-blown pathology."""
26104	29	In other words, down to earth: if you feel discomfort, suffering, fear, depression, from having lived 3 winters between distance learning and a mask at school, from no longer being able to play with your peers or celebrate a birthday, if you no longer have been able to reach school or go to the cinema without a pass, if you have no longer been able to see your grandparents because you are a possible spreader, if you are also undergoing a family and social climate of stress, hypochondria or apartheid, if your family is facing the dramatic psychological and socio-economic consequences of pandemic management and now looks with dread at the future of a war economy....
26104	30	"then you are potentially a psychiatrically ill adult and it is better not to waste time, you need to stuff yourself with psychotropic drugs ""suitable for your age""..."
26104	32	We are approaching more and more quickly and unconsciously the US social model, where a lively child is treated with a diagnosis of hyperactivity, where whoever fails with respect to the goal of success is guilty, maladapted, cannot be homogenized, to be marginalized, a dangerous symptom of a way of feel non-compliant.
26104	34	And today we get the news from the USA of a 10-year-old boy, arrested in handcuffs and pilloried by a video shot and circulated online by the police themselves.
26104	36	"The boy had sent text messages to the school threatening to carry out a massacre. As Skytg24 reports today, ""the threat follows the massacre at the Uvalde elementary school in Texas, where an eighteen-year-old opened fire and killed 21 people. It was the sheriff himself who published the video of the arrest of the child. In the video, an officer is seen carrying the handcuffed child inside the police car. ""This student's behavior is disgusting, especially after the recent tragedy in Uvalde, Texas. ""Making sure our children are safe is paramount. We will have law and order in our schools! My team didn't hesitate for a second,"" Marceno wrote on Facebook."
26104	38	"But is it so difficult to ask the doubt that the real culprit is precisely this social model, which would also like to set an example to the world, or does one run into the ""novax-Putin"" stigma?"
26107	1	99% did not want the Green Pass to be extended, and in fact they did. Democracy in Europe
26107	3	As you know, given that we have dedicated several articles to the subject, on a proposal from the European Commission, the European Parliament voted yesterday, as planned, to renew the EU Digital Covid certificate for another year. The vote was 453 in favour, 119 against and 19 abstentions.
26107	5	"The certificate regulation was scheduled to expire on 30 June. Earlier this month, a delegation from Parliament had already reached a ""political agreement"" with the Commission on the renewal of the certificate, thus making yesterday's vote practically a foregone conclusion. The funny thing, and which shows how much the EU cares about people's opinions, is that the Commission had held a public consultation whose results were extremely negative. The consultation gathered over 385,000 responses, almost all against the renewal!"
26107	7	In a letter to the European Ombudsman that French MEP Virginie Joron posted on her Twitter profile, Joron writes:
26107	9	I read hundreds of random responses with my team. I have not found any in favor of extending the QR code [i.e. the digital certificate]. Based on this large survey, it seems obvious that virtually all responses were negative.
26107	11	The negative trend of responses was evident from the outset. The full first page of responses, all dating back to February 4, can be found here. They are, of course, in the different languages ​​of the European Union: French, German, Italian and even one in English.
26107	13	To give readers an idea of ​​the tenor, here is a translation of a line or two of the first responses (starting at the bottom of the page):
26107	15	I am completely against the creation of this certificate given what is currently happening with the disastrous handling of Covid by the EU…
26107	17	I want this cst [probably a reference to Belgium's 'Covid Safe Ticket'] or vaccination passport simply deleted…
26107	19	There are scientifically unsupported claims in the draft document. For example, the Covid certificate is claimed to be effective protection against the spread of the virus – what data can support this claim?…
26107	21	Hi, I am shocked and disgusted by the freedom killing decisions taken in the EU…regarding this “European certificate”…..
26107	23	I never want to be subjected to a discriminatory certificate again…
26107	25	And so on through 385,191 replies, almost all negative.
26107	27	Naturally, since the responses were almost all negative and against, the Commission decided the opposite: it reached an agreement to continue it. Because, in the end, the Commission doesn't care what Europeans think. The important thing is only his agenda.
26108	1	Netherlands: 30,000 farmers on tractor rides to protest against the government's environmental policies
26108	3	The imposition of environmental policies by the minority Rutte government, remotely controlled from Brussels, is creating deep protests in the country, because it risks wiping out a substantial part of its agricultural economy. This has brought 30,000 farmers with tractors onto the highways. Here are some videos, which were obviously ignored in Italy of the impressive gathering.
26108	5	The protest derives from the imposition of an absurd regulation by the government against the emission of greenhouse gases, in this case based on nitrogen and ammonia, compounds that derive essentially from animal breeding. The government's goal is to reduce the animals raised by 30%, but this would obviously lead to the closure of a large number of farms, some of which are centuries old. All this will be sacrificed in the name of the ideology of the new European USSR and its centralized planning.
26108	7	The Netherlands are traditional exporters of meat to the rest of Europe, so there will also be a very heavy impact on the prices of these food products in other countries. The Rutte government is well aware that there will be very heavy repercussions on these companies, but in any case it has stated that... it doesn't care about anything, that companies must change and that the legislation will still be implemented. What will these sacrificed farmers do on the altar of climate change? They will stick to the tram, or they will move on to even stronger forms of protest.
26108	9	Obviously you will never hear anything about these fallout from the Commission's environmental policies in Italy, where they only invite extreme environmentalists who don't make a living from their work on TV.
2611	1	Washington is ready to wage wars of sanctions down to the last European
2611	3	Even the closest allies of the United States are starting to kick their butts as they try to avoid the fate of those who will be sacrificed in the sanctions wars with Russia.
2611	4	"This situation is already causing particular anger both in Washington and in London, where they are strongly and determinedly proposing to ""punish"" those countries that are not actively ""fighting"" against Russia."
2611	5	British economists are calling on Germany to immediately impose an embargo on Russian hydrocarbons. They define their purchases of Russian gas and oil as financing of the Russian military.
2611	6	In case of refusal, Berlin is threatened by the imposition of sanctions by Washington, London and Brussels. And never mind that the sanctions have already led to a rise in manufacturing inflation to 31% – and the oil and gas embargo could bury the German economy.
2611	7	Similar threats are also being sent to Hungary, which has also been barred from receiving financial assistance from Brussels, and threaten consequences for maintaining neutrality in Ukraine.
2611	8	In London, they are already ready to say that buying German goods is like supporting Russia, since they were produced with the help of Russian energy carriers. If so, then it's time to limit their access to the US and UK markets.
2611	9	Similar reports have already been made in Washington regarding Israel, its closest ally. The “hawks” in Congress, usually pro-Israel, turned the tables in the conditions of the Ukrainian crisis and began to threaten Jerusalem with the imposition of sanctions and the freezing of US military aid in the amount of three billion dollars per year. The reason is Israel's refusal to join Western sanctions.
2611	10	India, which remains neutral and buys oil from Russia, is no less under pressure. The United States suddenly began accusing her of human rights violations. Soon we can expect threats of sanctions, which have already been applied against India in the past due to allegations of discrimination against Muslims.
2611	11	As the consequences of the sanctions wars affect the economy, the desire to participate in them is declining rapidly. In Britain, the share of supporters of the sanctions also dropped from 50% to 36% in one month. And the more persistent will be the pressure of America, which acts according to the well-known logic: you die today in the war with Russia, and I will die tomorrow. If necessary, Washington is ready to unleash wars of sanctions to the last European.
26112	1	“The Great Game” II: British activity in Ukraine
26112	3	Geopolitics is a game on a fixed board in which not only the main players change, but also the colors of the pieces, and the rules themselves are fluid. Even if the basic mechanics remain unchanged and some storylines return years or even centuries later to remind us that the game of thrones (Game of Thrones) invariably takes place before our eyes, usually too distracted to notice its contours. Again British agents appear in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to persuade the natives to declare war on Russia so that Britain regains its dominant position, first in Europe and eventually also in the Middle East. The Great Game continues.
26112	5	Role distribution
26112	6	Only people who fail to recognize the changes in international politics can still think that the Ukrainian game is played by (only) Russia and the United States. For nothing. Of course, the American hegemon still maintains overall control over all geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere, but its suffocating economy forces a division of labour. The reality is that if the United States does not focus on the China issue, it will not only lose its (already shattered) record as the world's largest economy, but will also be dethroned as the most important center of global capital, which already sees itself as undergoing change from the supported side.
26112	8	If Wall Street once (partially) replaced the City, today the possibility of shifting the main weight of global finance to Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing remains on the table. Since China is already the world's leading industrial center, the concentration of elements of capital's big decisions could rescue the consumerist form of capitalism known as Fordism, which has been dominant since the end of World War II. And all this while America and the UK are already enacting a major transformation of capitalism under the guise of COVID-19 and the climate crisis. Americans must turn to address these challenges, to focus on the Far East and the Pacific, or else they can get a near-fatal kick in their… rear.
26112	10	The empire strikes again
26112	11	However, Washington did not dominate and paralyze Europe for so many decades as to leave it today without the enlightened leadership of the Anglo-Saxons. History and geopolitics have come full circle, as we witness a bizarre, but thoroughly serious, attempt to rebuild the British Empire. It is not the Americans, but the British who are Russia's main opponents in Ukraine. In effect, Westminster took full control of the foreign policy (including energy security) of Poland and the Baltic states. The British presence is more than visible on the historical battlefield of the Great Game, i.e. in Central Asia. Each week brings new evidence of Britain's growing involvement in the conflict with Russia.
26112	12	Another visit by Boris Johnson to Kiev (immediately after the European summits) is recognized in the United Kingdom as a proposal that cannot be rejected by Volodymyr Zelensky: that the Ukrainians not even think of any other scenario than joining the organized bloc under the leadership with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (and probably Moldova and Romania). The second tier of the same plan would be UkroPolin, a hybrid Polish-Ukrainian state, promoted in Polish and Ukrainian politics, especially by politicians overtly controlled by the British embassy. And of course the last act of the operation would probably be to launch this whole alliance against Russia.
26112	14	New colonies of the old empire
26112	15	England is increasing its assets in Ukraine. As Kiev prepared to attack Russia, the British trained at least 22,000 Ukrainian soldiers (Operation Orbital). Now Prime Minister B. Johnson has promised to train 10,000 more, probably in Poland. Since February, Westminster has transferred £1.3bn to Kiev, supplied thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles, rocket launchers and artillery systems, including NATO's M109. The silly final of the Eurovision Song Contest, which will be hosted by Ukraine next year, will also be staged in… United Kingdom. Indeed, perhaps Ukraine will emerge with Poland in UkroPolin, but only to turn them into British colonies.
26112	17	War propaganda in the UK is perhaps not as primitive as in Poland or Lithuania, but nearly as intense, although at least there are some independent voices tolerated even by the left (George Galloway's British Workers' Party, Chris Williamson Movement), who from the right (popular conservative writer and blogger Peter Hitchens). Censorship, however, reaches universities and the mainstream media eagerly pursues any public criticism of the resurgence of imperialism.
26112	19	Russo-British War?
26112	20	However, the pro-Kiev tide in the UK seems to be ebbing and ordinary English and Scottish families are questioning the delays in paying the so-called “thanks” for welcoming Ukrainian immigrants into their homes (many English and Scottish families are still waiting for the 350 pledged pounds per month). It hardly matters, because “Europe's oldest (liberal) democracy” is no longer democratic, nor pro-free speech, and the political and financial establishment almost bluntly state that the UK is itself at war with the Russia.
26112	22	"The Great Game is back. Today it is played not only in diplomacy, on battlefields and in secret service combat, but also in a virtual dimension. The techniques vary, but the domain is always in order. Only one empire can survive and, when it cannot, it prefers to divide itself to prevent the end of Anglo-Saxon hegemony. As Sir William Harcourt once told the young Winston Churchill: ""Nothing ever happens..."""
26116	1	"Bonino: ""Italy must import 400,000 immigrants a year to replace Italians"""
26116	3	Bonino and Calenda should be arrested for high treason. Those who propose ethnic subversion through immigration - which is genocide by other means - should have no place in civilian life.
26116	5	Integrate more immigrants to save the Italian demographic balance. Italy is an overpopulated country. Japan, with zero immigration, has no security and welfare problems.
26116	7	If one really wanted to 'save the demographic balance' with immigration, only temporary workers should enter who would then be replaced on a rotational basis every five years by younger workers. Instead we host 2.5 million non-working immigrants: children, wives, parents and various parasites. Ergo: they are a cost, not a balance.
26116	9	So Italy does not need more immigrants. If anything, to get rid of 2.5 million economic and social parasites. And replace the other 2.5 million with unemployed Italians and the descendants of Italians in South America.
26116	11	Bonino, for years with the Radicals financed by Soros, was one of the architects of the demographic vacuum that she is now denouncing.
26116	13	Thanks to her and to those like her, we are missing a few million Italians. Who now she and those like her want to replace with Africans with an IQ that would slide us into a future depicted well in the film Idiocracy. Obviously she was wrong before and wrong now. Otherwise we wouldn't have 30% of unemployed young people. The reality is that, despite the demographic vacuum, we still have 'too many' young people.
26116	15	We need a Nuremberg, not a Draghi government.
26118	1	Orsini attacks Draghi: “That cheating in the meeting with Zelensky”
26118	3	"Professor Alessandro Orsini, professor of Sociology of international terrorism has no doubts: ""Draghi is cheating the Italians in agreement with Biden""."
26118	5	"A concept that the professor, accused of being pro-Putin and practically at the top of the various ""proscription lists"" that have appeared in recent months on some media containing intellectuals and journalists considered friends of Moscow, reiterated last night in the episode of It's not The Arena conducted by Massimo Giletti on La7."
26118	7	"Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Professor Orsini has denounced what he believes to be the false narrative of the West about the real reasons for the war, demonstrating how it was in reality the United States and NATO that for years provoked Russia and cause his reaction to Ukraine. He was not the only one to say it, but despite this he has become the symbol of the Italian intellectual to be detested as capable of defending what the West has now identified as the ""new Hitler"". It has been attacked left and right, with lots of parliamentarians running to ask for it to be blacked out from television channels, starting with those of the public service, on the pretext that Rai is paid with Italian money even if certain pseudo-liberal politicians they always remember when it suits them."
26118	9	"Orsini, however, did not let himself be intimidated and continued his crusade, denouncing the faults of the West and dismantling what he defines as the fake narrative on the Ukrainian conflict concocted by the mainstream system. According to him, in fact, there would be ""a clear gap between what we hear and what really happens"" and this because there would be centers of power that would manipulate Western information. And last night from Giletti he went on the attack on Prime Minister Draghi."
26118	11	"Here are his words: ""Mario Draghi cheated the Italians"". Because? How?: “I would like the Prime Minister to put himself in the shoes of the Italians – explained Orsini – in Italy, on the other hand, there is a very clear chain of command, with Biden who makes the decisions, then there is Stoltenberg and then Draghi ”."
26118	13	"And he points out one detail: ""Every time Zelensky meets a florist he asks him for weapons, especially heavy ones, but we don't talk about it with the heads of state"". The reference is to the meeting that Draghi had with the Ukrainian president together with Olaf Scholz, chancellor of Germany, and Emmanuel Macron, president of the French Republic."
26118	15	"""On that occasion, the president of Ukraine did not ask for weapons - added Orsini - and he did not do so because they agreed"". And here lies, according to the professor, the ""cheating"" of Draghi who would have called Zelensky asking him not to make the request for other weapons, in consideration of the problems that the argument raises in the parliamentary majority that supports the Italian government (it is from yesterday the clash between the Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio and the M5S who would even like to distrust him). At least until the next parliamentary passage when, as has always happened, the premier will try to make the parties that support him swallow the soup."
26118	17	"Orsini finally explained that Draghi's is only a tactic to stall for time and overcome any crisis in Parliament: “What must Draghi do to do the perfect scam? He must deprive Parliament, override it ”he attacks again, to then continue:“ In other words – he added – he must put himself in the perfect condition to genuflect to Biden. And to do this he must make sure that Parliament does not say anything about the conduct of the war in Ukraine ”. The prime minister's goal in the end, according to the teacher, would be only to ""cheat the Italians and find a way to send heavy weapons whenever the US requests it""."
26118	19	"Heavy accusations that would demonstrate the degree of Italy's submission to the United States. And that would primarily penalize Italian economic interests. Because, as Orsini always explains, ""the longer the war goes on, the more problems there will be for the Italian economy""."
26118	21	"One thing is certain, Orsini does not seem at all intimidated by the attacks he has received, nor by being included in the lists of Putin's friends. He then issued a challenge to Giletti: ""Take a pen and paper, let's calculate the international policy experts who in Italy speak well of the government saying that Draghi does nothing wrong and of those who do the opposite"" also denouncing the consequences and intimidation which those like him who think differently would be subjected. But this is certainly nothing new, given that since the time of the war in Iraq the life of correspondents who strayed from the official narrative has always been hard. The real news is that there are those who resist, despite everything."
26119	1	St. Petersburg sets the stage for the War of the Economic Corridors
26119	3	"In St. Petersburg, the new world powers have gathered to overturn the ""rules-based order"" devised by the United States and reconnect the globe in their own way"
26119	5	The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum has for years now emerged as absolutely essential for understanding the evolving dynamics and trials and tribulations of Eurasia integration.
26119	7	St. Petersburg in 2022 is even more crucial as it directly connects to three simultaneous developments that I had previously outlined, in no particular order:
26119	9	"First, the arrival of the ""new G8"" - four BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), plus Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico, whose GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP) is already pale the old, Western-dominated G8."
26119	11	"Secondly, China's ""Three Rings"" strategy for developing geo-economic relations with its neighbors and partners."
26119	13	"Third, the development of BRICS+, or extended BRICS, including some members of the ""new G8"", to be discussed at the next summit in China."
26119	15	There was no doubt that President Putin would be the star of St. Petersburg 2022, delivering a trenchant and detailed speech at the plenary session.
26119	17	"Among the highlights, Putin destroyed the illusions of the so-called ""golden billion"" living in the industrialized West (only 12 percent of the world's population) and the ""irresponsible macroeconomic policies of the G7 countries""."
26119	19	"The Russian president noted how ""EU losses due to sanctions against Russia"" could exceed $400 billion a year and that high energy prices in Europe - something that actually started ""in the third quarter last year"" - are due to ""blindly believing in renewable energies""."
26119	21	He also dutifully rejected Western propaganda of “Putin's price hike,” saying the food and energy crisis is linked to misguided Western economic policies, eg, “Russian grain and fertilizers are sanctioned” to the detriment of the West.
26119	23	Simply put: the West misjudged Russia's sovereignty when it sanctioned it, and now it's paying a very high price.
26119	25	"Chinese President Xi Jinping, addressing the forum via video, sent a message to the entire South of the world. He evoked ""true multilateralism"", insisting that emerging markets must have a ""voice in global economic management"" and called for ""improved North-South and South-South dialogue""."
26119	27	It was up to Kazakh President Tokayev, Russia's and China's deeply strategic partner, to personally deliver the punchline: Eurasia integration should progress hand in hand with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Here it is, the circle closed.
26122	1	NATO promises to defend Melilla from assaults but not Lampedusa
26122	3	Yet an attack has been underway against the Italian coasts for decades from all sides. One also from a NATO 'ally', Turkey.
26122	5	The boats arriving in Almeria testify to Algiers' intention not to control immigration, in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Spain.
26122	7	Algeria yesterday sent Spain a new warning of its 'disappointment' over political issues, confirming the threat not to control the clandestine sea route. The arrival of several small boats off the coast of Almeria showed Algeria's permissiveness, as expected by the state security forces when the Spanish government decided to renew diplomatic ties with Morocco last March and changed the its location in the Sahara.
26122	9	To please one supplier of illegal immigrants, they dissatisfied another. It happens when you just ask that others do what you should do.
26122	11	"Yesterday's migratory episode in Almería - ""which will not be the last"", according to Guardia Civil sources consulted by this newspaper - took place in parallel with the closing of the NATO summit, whose agenda included the protection of Ceuta's borders and Melilla, after the armed assault of the previous days."
26122	13	Nothing about Lampedusa.
26122	15	What is the use of an alliance that 'defends' us from an imaginary danger, Russian tourists, and not from the Afro-Islamic invasion? The only threat to the future is Afro-Islamic immigration. This one must be fought, not Vlad.
26126	1	Great reset: in the end we will be the ones to ask him for the lockdown
26126	3	The Italian information lies knowing that it is lying, telling us the story of a Russia that would lose the war militarily and economically, to hide the catastrophe of a strategy that is bringing the most fragile peoples in the West to their knees, ours among the first, part of a front led by an elderly gentleman with little lucidity and remote control, literally placed at the head of the most powerful and at the same time decadent country in the world.
26126	5	It's all a lie: about the beginning and origins of the conflict, about who is exacerbating and prolonging it, who is losing and winning it. Even on the values ​​that we Westerners would represent: as if the stories of Julian Assange or Shireen Abu Akleh could be erased with dull and banal words.
26126	7	However, what is once again enormously striking is the ability of an obscure (not so much) direction to take advantage of emergency parentheses to continue its class struggle from top to bottom, stealing from the poor to give to the rich, overall redesigning the society in the image and likeness of its squalid partisan interests.
26126	9	While Draghi meets the top management of Uber and completely ignores the protests of fellow taxi drivers in the main squares of the country, we are preparing to snatch the Italian beaches away from small and medium-sized businesses to entrust them to large foreign multinationals. And Alessandro Somma says well on this point, in the Byoblu special signed by Gianuario, when he underlines how such measures would have been unthinkable if they had had the same impact on countries such as France or Germany: in fact, net of the need to possibly review the conditions of the concessions , the change of model will mean chopping up and throwing away a century of Italian tradition, history and customs. What's wrong, the usual servants of narration with unified networks ask almost dumbfounded, in wanting to entrust this sector to free competition too? There is a lot of bad: first for the crucial nature of the sector in the culture of our country, second because it would compare our small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who in many cases built those structures with the bitter sacrifice of several generations, with large international multinationals.
26126	11	I'm waiting for an Amazon-beach that knocks out Luca, the manager of the establishment where I go to the beach every summer: simply unacceptable.
26126	13	And in the meantime the cost of living explodes: with fifty euros you go to the supermarket and you barely pay for the air conditioning to keep the place cool for half an hour, assuming you don't get to ration that too. Then there is talk of energy rationing, due to the sanctions that we are allegedly imposing on Russia (it may seem like a paradox, but on TV we are taught that freedom comes at a price, it is a privilege), and finally of water rationing, cause of the drought that devours us. We will very plausibly soon have the rationing of CO2 emissions, for the next environmentalist emergency parenthesis.
26126	15	All potential forms of social control because someone will have to govern these rationings and nothing new under the sun or particularly shocking: after all we have even been accustomed by now to the rationing of civil rights, as it declined during the health crisis for years ... and yes it is rumored that in the autumn we will start again like this. Precisely.
26126	17	And think about it for a moment, taking the average male and female worker as an example: afflicted by high unsustainable prices, with stagnant wages because the EU, the ECB and the Bank of Italy ask us for it (while the unions are silent, accomplices and guilty!), with diesel skyrocketing, with you having to travel at least fifty kilometers a day to get to and from work, what could be more providential and redemptive than a good lockdown in autumn? We would certainly find someone happy to oblige us, anxiously waiting for that moment.
26128	1	Depopulation through vaccines
26128	3	After Germany where in the first three months of this year births fell by about 13 per cent, immediately suggesting a role of vaccines which have now known consequences on both the female reproductive system with the well-known menstrual disorders and male with a reduction in the number and motility of sperm. There is also a sudden and inexplicable drop in the birth rate in other European countries such as Austria and Switzerland even if for others the statistics are slow in coming, but now there is the sensational case of Taiwan where the birth rate fell by 23.24% in May 2022, compared to May 2021.
26128	5	Just like in Germany, also in Taiwan, as can be seen from the table, the birth rate remained constant for many years and then literally collapsed in 2022, a certain number of months after the blanket vaccination campaigns. The numbers on the island are important because they are so high that they cannot be passed off as causal oscillations even if as extreme as the advocates of vaccines to desperation might lead you to believe: statistical mathematics does not allow it.
26128	7	In fact, having no possible justifications from this point of view, an attempt is being made to put together an operation of the long Covid type, i.e. charging the disease for what is a consequence of vaccines. But in this case it is not so easy to cheat people because, at least in Europe, as in most of the world, the phenomenon should have already occurred in the first months of 2011 if the effect of the drop in the birth rate was due to the infection from coronavirus. But in Taiwan this is even more impossible to sustain, because the island has practically had no covid in 2020 and 2021, but the disease has practically spread with vaccines, i.e. it exploded starting from mid-April when the 91 for one hundred of the population was already vaccinated thanks to the incessant inoculation campaigns of 2021.
26128	9	"Even the least of the idiots would understand that covid cannot be the cause of a drop in the birth rate in the spring of this year, given that apparently from the latest ongoing research by television virologists it seems that pregnancy lasts approximately 9 months, but they try all the same, convinced that after all, more than believing in this nonsense, people are very afraid of disobeying and above all of showing themselves disobedient. After all, even science has been indelibly stained with infamy and to realize this, it is enough to read, among other things, this fact check of December 5, 2020 published by Reuters which states that the vaccine is certainly safe for pregnancy ""because there are no evidence that it is not safe”. In fact we know that no study was done, specific to pregnancy and fertility, we were simply told it was safe without knowing it."
26128	11	Indeed perhaps not: at this point some independent observers are beginning to believe that the vaccination of the youngest part of the population, that of childbearing age, although completely useless given the minimal effects of the covid on it, was planned specifically to obtain precisely the purpose of a drop in births which, moreover, was one of the proclaimed objectives of the vaccine prophet Bill Gates and of all the elite part that recognizes itself in these cheap dystopias, from a novel on the newsstand which is after all the gist of the thoughts of a very rich class, but lacking in culture and intelligence.
26128	13	Obviously the vast majority of people who participated in the vaccination campaigns could not have imagined such a sinister purpose, assuming that there was one and this will be seen from the duration of the conditions of difficult fertility due to gene serums. But I will tell you, maybe two years ago I would have been perplexed by these theses, but after 24 months of absurdity and lies, then exposed that one would never have expected to have to endure, after the Fed's attempt to hide the documentation on the approval of the Pfizer vaccine and then to release the documents in installments so as to take 75 years before arriving at the truth, after the discovery of the fakes and manipulations in clinical trials nothing can really be excluded. Except of course honesty and good faith
2613	1	China prepares for war
2613	3	Public opinion at the moment focuses its attention on the war in Ukraine, which rightly concerns the European continent. But what is happening in Asia has arguably much higher risk potential.
2613	5	China is quietly preparing for a mega Asian conflict without precedent in the history of humanity.
2613	6	From a satellite photo, as revealed the day before yesterday by the online news outlet Insideover, it emerged that the People's Republic of China has built a new long-range early warning radar. The image was taken in February by commercial satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies and shows that the new Large Phased Array Radar, or LPAR, was built on top of a mountain in the Yiyuan area of ​​Shandong province, about 110 kilometers southeast of Jinan city. The new radar can give China an early warning system for ballistic missile launches from North Korea, South Korea, most of Japan and even some sectors of the Russian Far East. This may give the reader insight into the scale of conflicts China plans to face on the Asian continent
2613	7	But that is not all.
2613	9	Some time ago the news was announced that the People's Republic of China and the Solomon Islands are about to conclude a defense agreement, which will allow the Chinese Navy to have a real military base in this country. In itself there would be nothing special, were it not for the fact that the Solomon Islands are located opposite Australia, albeit at a distance of 2000 kilometres.
2613	10	"The Australian media and political exponents of the island-continent have reacted vehemently: the Chinese base in the Solomon Islands is a ""red line"" and Australia will never tolerate the presence of the Chinese. These statements were echoed by the White House: ""the United States will act accordingly if China installs a military base in the Solomon Islands, in the Pacific""."
2613	12	In this regard, it should be considered that the USA, Great Britain and Australia signed an anti-China pact called Aukus a few months ago. It is clear that China, through the installation of a military-naval base in the Pacific Ocean, is preparing for a conflict also against the three countries of the Aukus pact.
2613	13	What is more surprising is that China says it does not want a third world war and supports the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy, as Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Wang Wenbin said a couple of days ago, quoted by the Tass Russian agency. In light of China's preparations for a future Asian war, the Chinese spokesman's statement sounds mocking. China does not want a third world war, but if it were forced to…
26131	1	Ukraine admits: Russia is winning, we retreat
26131	3	“After the heavy battles for Lysychansk, the Defense Forces of Ukraine were forced to leave their occupied positions and borders.” This was announced, twenty-four hours late with a pathetic post on Facebook by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in relation to the city, conquered yesterday by Russian troops.
26131	5	“Faced with the multiple advantages of Russian troops in terms of artillery, aviation, rocket launchers, ammunition and personnel – is the explanation of the surrender of Lysychansk – continuing the defense of the city would have led to fatal consequences. In order to preserve the lives of the Ukrainian defenders, the decision was therefore made to withdraw.” “Now we continue our fight. Unfortunately, an iron will and patriotism are not enough to win, material and technical resources are needed”, concludes the post, promising: “We will return and we will absolutely win”.
26131	7	Of course, you will come back.
26131	9	"The risk of the entire Luhansk region falling under Russian control ""exists, that's clear"", admitted the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, answering questions from journalists. Meanwhile, the entire region was already in de facto Russian hands."
26131	11	"In the Luhansk region there is ""the most complicated and dangerous situation. And there, it is true, we are not ahead"", says the president, pointing out that however in other areas of the country ""we are making progress"". Furthermore, ""the delivery of arms will increase our advantage and we will be able to push harder in this direction too (that of Luhansk, ed.)."""
26131	13	You are only ahead on social media. In the real world it is a catastrophe.
26134	1	"The German Greens' anti-Putin dilemma: ""How many minutes can a shower last?"""
26134	3	"But does Merkel wash the famous ""big ass""? It is not a provocation and it is not a far-fetched question, the former chancellor being the main responsible (the reasons have often been eviscerated, in this area and in the sister area of ​​the Atlantic) for the energy crisis gripping Europe. And now Germany is equipping itself in the German way: the state claims to decide the frequency and duration of showers, so as to save gas and water in one fell swoop."
26134	5	The new environmental catechism
26134	7	A rich debate is flourishing: on the one hand the liberals, a few, reduced to an Indian reservation, scandalized by yet another Hegelian meddling, on the other the progressives, too many, implacable, who demand: more state, more controls, less hygiene. For example, listen to the Minister of Economy, who is a Green, an environmentalist, as to say that lurid politics is not just our thing: Robert Kabeck doesn't want to impose anything on anyone, he claims, but unfortunately the alternative is the German one: either you actually give up the shower, or you take another one, based on Zyklon B.
26134	9	"It is useless to argue: neo-communism has already won, neo but always not very clean, in Holland they have decided to reduce the time ""allowed"" under the jet from 10 to 5 minutes: stuff that makes you shiver, but Kabeck laughs like a kapò: ""5 minutes ? Too many, I've never used so many, I'm fast”. And since this is done in Pratesi, everyone is required to follow it. Obviously the media, starting with the Italian ones, are deployed in the usual immodest way, something like the perpetual dose of vaccine that hurts more, especially for children, and makes it more inevitable. Reading the veins of the regime is believing."
26134	11	Of course, thirty years of the European Union have done us great good: we have regressed to African tribal levels, with which, perhaps, many migrants will go back given that once they land they find the same opportunities as at home. But who would have thought it: from the summary care of the body, daughter of the war, to the consumerist explosion of cosmetics, foams, essences, up to the return of filth in the Marxist-Leninist-Brigatist mold. How will all those useless influencers do? Will they shoot unshaven poses with scabs in their highlights?
26134	13	Italy is a particular case, the German debate - false, hypocritical, but at least timidly proposed - here is skipped on the ball (and not washed). Chist is 'o Paese di Fulco, a man born rich who has found a way to stay in the world in fake ecological fancazzismo; 'o Paese di Alessandro Gassman, someone whose mission is to spy, report, and that one doesn't wear a mask, and this other one hasn't had his fiftieth dose, and that other one has washed, do you understand? He washed up!
26134	15	The crazy German proposal
26134	17	"The vice president of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Kubicki, blurted out: ""I take a shower until I'm done and I don't give a damn about Kabeck's times""; a little more and they lynch him, the boss of the CDU, Merz, who hangs out in the crucca ZTL, has come to argue that only those who heat water with solar energy can wash: the poor can die of typhus. He sucks, and it's scary, but going back to daytime, dime for two minutes including rinsing, is no longer an option: it's a reality, and it doesn't allow for alternatives."
26134	19	End of relaxing showers, lazy and coquettish baths, whoever can fills the tub with Dom Perignon, the others all model Carola Rackete. Imagine the scenes on the buses, on the means of transport: the usual ass face that, behind six masks one on top of the other, points like a beagle: sniff sniff, here you don't smell the stink: but you, excuse me, when did you wash the last time? This morning? But you are a criminal, do you want us all to die? Comptroller, sir doesn't taste like shit! And the inspector, what a stench of a Roman dumpster: I'm sorry, he has to get off, it's the law. And be ashamed.
26134	21	This bus is a gas chamber, this Europe is a dung heap and this West is fucked. From Berlin to Amsterdam, from Paris to Verona, where a remarkable case occurs: for years, for decades under the balcony of Romeo and Juliet the national shame, the cradle of neo-Nazis, a city to be sanitized, some partisan scribes of negligible value done an article a day, he too had to find a way to stay in the world; then they elect the union footballer Tommasi, one of those who earned millions but always with a clenched fist, and Verona suddenly becomes the democratic avant-garde, the national jewel. And what is Tommasi doing to you as the very first act? He rations water, forbids it, convinced in this way of saving the Veneto and the whole planet from desert drought.
26134	23	As populist idiocy, there is something to induce Greta to an unexpected orgasm. Verona dirigista, populist, statist and the showers, dear beggars who pay taxes to reduce you to bums, you can also dismantle them: next stop, a ticket to swim in the sea and you'll see if we don't get there. After that, in the autumn, a nice omnibus mega lockdown: of health, social, war, climate, ecological, energy security. Guaranteed lemon.
26134	25	"This is us, this is the Union, this is post-communism, always a little communist, that is, lurid. By the way: but yes, of course Merkel rinses the ""big ass"". The restrictions apply only to the troops, they don't, for the esteemed excellences only the best, if they don't want to cleanse themselves it's because they don't want to, because in their Leninist ecological stench they root well, certainly not because someone imposes it on them."
26142	1	"The UN: ""New greenhouse gas record. We are off track"""
26142	3	"The World Meteorological Organization's annual bulletin records a higher annual rate of increase than the 2011-2020 average, and this trend has continued in 2021. ""At this rate, the temperature rise is well over 1.5-2°C"""
26142	5	A new record for greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was reached last year, with an annual rate of increase above the average for the period between 2011 and 2020, and this trend has continued in 2021. The alarm comes from the Organization World Meteorological Survey (WMO), a United Nations agency, in its annual report on heat-trapping greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide).
26142	7	"Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases put the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement at risk, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said, warning: ""We are really off track."""
26142	9	"""The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin - adds Taalas - contains a clear scientific message for the climate change negotiators at COP26. At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, by the end of this century we will see a rise in temperature by far above the Paris Agreement targets by 1.5 to 2°C above pre-industrial levels""."
26142	11	"The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere passed the 400 parts per million mark in 2015, recalls the WMO secretary general, noting that ""just five years later, it has exceeded 413 ppm. This is more than just chemical formulas and figures on a graph. It has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren,"" he added."
26142	13	"""Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer,"" Taalas explained. ""The last time Earth experienced a similar concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when temperature was 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then,"" Taalas said."
26142	15	"""Many countries - he continued - are now setting carbon neutral targets and it is hoped that COP26 will see a substantial increase in commitments. But we must transform our commitment into actions that will have an impact on the gases that cause climate change. We must review ours industrial, energy and transportation systems and the whole way of life. The necessary changes are economically accessible and technically possible. There is no time to waste,"" Taalas said finally."
26143	1	CLIMATE: GLOBAL WARMING will last a LONG time and the first victim could be MAN. A STUDY reveals it
26143	3	Although several states have implemented actions, thanks to the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming, there have been no significant improvements, particularly towards the reduction of CO2. A study carried out by a group of researchers from the McGill Universities of Quebec, Canada, Oxford, Leeds and New York, also reported by the newspaper Repubblica, hypothesized three future scenarios up to 2500. From what emerged, taking into consideration some places such as the American Midwest (the granary of the world), the Amazon forest (the lungs of our planet) and the Indian sub-continent (the most populated area on Earth), in the first scenario the monoculture of cereals could be replaced by subtropical plants such as pineapples , in the second the great forest could disappear and turn into a desert due to the lack of rains and, in the last one, in India the intense heat could make it difficult for man to work outdoors assuming the use of protective clothes or even of machines that completely replace the human being.
26143	5	These are apocalyptic scenarios for the three places taken into consideration by the experts. But more generally, across the globe, vegetation could change dramatically and agricultural production shrink. Sea levels would continue to rise due to the accumulation of heat in the ocean floor and many people would be forced to migrate north due to heat stress which would start to be felt starting from countries close to the equator.
26143	7	Scholars, therefore, are particularly alarmed, since it will be impossible to go back to the pre-industrial era. The solution would be to completely remove the polluting gases, but that is obviously impossible. For this reason, it is at least necessary to aim, as soon as possible, for a substantial cut in CO2, implementing innovative long-term actions.
26152	1	"Abrignani (Cts) on Covid: ""Vaccine obligation as long as the virus circulates, perhaps years"""
26152	3	"For the immunologist and member of the CTS, the obligation to vaccinate against Covid ""will make sense as long as the virus is circulating"""
26152	5	"In an interview with La Stampa, the immunologist Sergio Abrignani, a member of the Cts, explains that the obligation to get vaccinated against Covid19 ""will make sense as long as the virus circulates, and I have the impression that it will last for years. I would like to emphasize that it is not just about the individual, but about the whole community and the only way out of the pandemic. For example, there are 27 million people over 50, of whom almost 2 million are not vaccinated. The latter, 7%, represent 70% of those in intensive care. It's not just their problem, but that of hospitals and other sick people who can't find a place""."
26152	7	The immunologist says that obligations, such as the one for the over 50s regarding work, are useful. «In my opinion, yes, but these are political choices that I won't enter into. From a scientific point of view I can say that vaccination is a fundamental tool. Then I was for the obligation when it wasn't there, let alone now ».
26152	9	With regard to whether or not children are vaccinated, Abrignani explains that «the virus has not disappeared and the scientific societies of pediatrics strongly advise it. They are the same doctors who consult when children are sick, and now instead they are thought to be lying for a worldwide conspiracy. Surreal».
26152	11	The immunologist on the fourth dose
26152	13	"As for the fourth dose, Abrignani says that «a fourth dose with the same vaccine of the Wuhan strain, as tested in Israel, the data does not currently support its benefit. After all, with so many vaccinations in the past we have seen that three doses are enough, two doses 3-4 weeks apart and the third after 4-12 months, guaranteeing an immune memory of 5 to 10 years ». Eventually, according to the immunologist, they could benefit from a fourth recall «rare cases of immunosuppressed for genetic, pharmacological or infectious reasons, or dialysis patients. For them, it is hoped that the fourth dose will induce at least short-term protection"". For the rest of the population, Abrignani believes that ""the booster would be a new dose after the current three, but we do not yet know if, how and when it will be necessary""."
26152	15	Read also:—>Man shot dead in the street: carabinieri investigate
26152	17	"For the immunologist, three options could open up: «The first, unlikely, is that the virus disappears and at that point there would be no need for boosters. The second, less unlikely, but difficult, given Omicron's record infectivity, is that a new variant will force us to update vaccines. The third is that the current variant remains. In the latter case, a booster could be evaluated with a vaccine updated to Omicron which perhaps also prevents infection very effectively as well as the disease. Then there is the possibility, difficult for me, that the third dose will not last long and then a fourth would be necessary with the current vaccine""."
26152	19	"Read also:—>Canada-USA bridge reopened occupied by ""freedom convoy"" for 6 days"
26152	21	"The next choices will be made «by monitoring protection from the disease in the field. If it went down for some reason, it would be time for a recall. So far the third dose holds up, lasts at least 5 months although eventually it will probably be much longer. The important fact is the protection from the disease, because it is not known how much antibodies are related to immunity. Based on the experience with other vaccines, with firm variants"", immunity could be of ""several years, but I am ready to be proven wrong""."
26152	23	"As for the side effects of the vaccine, Abrignani underlines that these are «irrational fears. The only fact is that in young people there can be rare myocarditis that is not serious and can be cured in a few days with cortisone. All regulatory agencies say there is a greater risk of myocarditis from viruses than from vaccines. Out of billions of people vaccinated, of which hundreds of millions under the age of 30, no one died for this reason ». Finally, with regard to the new Novavax vaccine, the immunologist explains that it is ""more traditional, based on recombinant proteins"" and that ""perhaps it will be able to convince unjustifiably doubtful people like some parents who fear for their children. Scientifically it will be useful to compare the duration of its protection with that of mRna vaccines, even if I don't think there will be a difference."

26156	3	the opinion
26156	5	Berlusconi can go down in history paving the way for the best, Draghi
26156	7	The Cav. can be the real protagonist in the race to Colle. Not as future president but as kingmaker
26156	9	What do I think of Berlusconi at the Quirinale? Since what the Financial Times would be the first best, Sergio Mattarella as president until the end of the legislature, is not practicable due to unavailability of the interested party, but since the second best is available, Mario Draghi at the Quirinale for seven years, the answer is that it would be a wrong choice. One, not the choice: any other name would be wrong. A malicious question, a clear answer: in itself, in the abstract, I don't believe that Berlusconi cannot be president of the Republic, indeed I recognize the reasons why he could be. If, always in the abstract, he became one, I wouldn't return my passport to the Interior Ministry: and let your malice die!
26156	11	"I did three electoral campaigns, one with the Progressives, two with the Ulivo, I was in the Senate for three legislatures: always, Berlusconi was the opponent to beat. If I have sometimes voted differently from my group, it was because I thought it would be better fought that way. I have always thought that visceral anti-Berlusconism, ""with the helmet"", has brought ""serious losses to the Achaeans"". Many have criticized me, but I was not alone. My appeal published in Corriere on 4 December 1994, one of my first public statements as a new senator, denounced the ""short-sighted pact against future generations"" with which the union had forced the removal from the budget of a pension reform, albeit modest presented by the first Berlusconi government: in addition to the signatures of Franco Modigliani, Sylos Labini and Mario Baldassarri, I also collected that of Romano Prodi."
26156	13	"Andreatta and Prodi founded the centre-left, with or without a hyphen, Berlusconi the centre-right. Together they gave birth to the season of majority and alternation. Compared to the current political landscape, I don't think I'm the only one who regrets it, and if it weren't for this, the future president would have to make them both senators for life. With Prodi (and Draghi general director of the Treasury) Italy won the Oscar of privatizations, liberalizing and returning to the market industrial sectors monopolized by the state for more than half a century; but he didn't even try to privatize Rai. Berlusconi circumvented the monopoly with his commercial television and thus claiming to be the mother of all liberalisations: it gives Italians the freedom to choose and gives entrepreneurs a formidable instrument for promoting the country's internal growth. A first, very small step towards the boundless digital freedom. Instead, for anti-Berlusconism, commercial television created an ""intrinsically Berlusconian"" world: thus it led the left to positions incompatible with the claim to interpret the modern. It was a war of power disguised as a war of religion, it was our thirty years' war, as the title of the book I wrote with Antonio Pilati."
26156	15	"Berlusconi, copyright Mario Seminerio, ""was no worse than many of his opponents sick of moralism who, however, did not have his intuitions, and for this reason they were bitter about their own obvious inadequacy"". His opponents first tried to decree him incompatible by focusing on the conflict of interest; then, with a technicality, to make it incompatible; finally they discussed the way to declare him incandidabile. A quarter of a century later he may well run for the highest office in the state."
26156	17	The problem is not whether he can run, but whether it is convenient for him. To be one in great spite of many of his enemies is already a success, the more they contest him the more his value increases: with all due respect for the other names that are mentioned, his appears more and more to be the only candidate that can be opposed to that of Dragons.
26156	19	Is it worth the risk? Why not silence his detractors instead, and go down in history as the one who, despite having the numbers to try to win, gives them up to pave the way for what he too must in his heart recognize to be the best choice for the country. It was he who sent him to govern the Bank of Italy, he who launched him to the presidency of the European Central Bank, he will be able to say that it was he who paved the way for him at Colle. Those were two excellent choices: this one will be too. Once again: thank you Silvio.

26160	1	"Russian gas in Europe, von der Leyen announces the drama: ""Prepare for the total cut of supplies"""
26160	3	"The point of no return is approaching in the international economic scenarios of the war between Russia and Ukraine. This is yet another ""blow"" for Italy, one of the countries most dependent on the energy front from Russia. ""We need to prepare for more gas supply disruptions, even a complete cut from Russia."" This is the dramatic announcement made today by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in her speech in the plenary session of the European Parliament for the presentation of the Czech presidency of the EU."
26160	5	Today, a total of 12 Member States are directly affected by partial or total reductions in gas supply. It is obvious: Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. For this reason, the Commission is working on a European emergency plan. We will present this plan and the necessary tools by mid-July. Member States already have their own national emergency plans. This is good, but we need European coordination and joint action. We need to make sure that, in the event of a complete outage, the gas flows to where it is needed most. We must provide for European solidarity. And we need to protect the single market and industry supply chains, explained the president.
26160	7	We must never forget the bitter lesson we learned at the start of the pandemic. Selfishness and protectionism only lead to disunity and fragmentation. While European unity and coordination have been the key remedies to overcome this brutal pandemic. As always, we hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. This is hard work ahead of us. But as in recent weeks, unity will lead to success, he stressed. The economic consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine are becoming more and more serious. Between the economic recession, inflation and the pandemic, it will be a very tough winter for Italians.
26166	1	Beware of the French lesson. It can also teach Italy something
26166	3	"It would be simplistic and even comforting to brand the result of the French legislative elections as the revenge of populism. A formula that purges the traditional parties of any fault, as if they were saying: what can you do if people prefer ""those there"" who are unpresentable."
26166	5	On the other hand, it is more difficult to investigate the reasons why the voters who chose Emmanuel Macron as president less than two months ago now punish him by denying him the parliamentary majority. Not only that: they practically wipe out the traditional formations that had so far dominated the Fifth Republic by drawing an unprecedented picture. Probably useful to decrypt also for all western democracies, including Italy. Paris, as we know, has been the bearer of revolutions and changes for at least two centuries. Indicates wind direction.
26166	7	France cherishes its welfare and has always been at the forefront of defending rights, whatever they may be. Whether the socialists or the Gaullists governed, the champions of the dualism always invented in the Hexagon between left and right, no one dreamed of questioning some social achievements. So it was from de Gaulle, at the origins of the Fifth Republic, to Chirac. Passing through Giscard, Pompidou, obviously Mitterrand. The first break occurred with Nicolas Sarkozy, and it was 2007, with the casual ostentation of wealth by the tenant of the Elysée, the holidays on the yachts of finance nabobs, the idea spread by the top that if one was poor he had to feel guilty and ask himself questions because social climbing is within everyone's reach, you just need to work harder. Slogans questionable in themselves and destined to become rancid after less than a year with the great economic crisis of 2008 that started in the United States and swept Europe.
26166	9	"Kicked out after his first mandate by the president nicknamed ""bling-bling"" by the noise of the jewels, here comes the long-time socialist François Hollande at the Elysée, who presented himself during the electoral campaign with the resounding promise to tax incomes above 90 per cent million euros to aim for a more equitable redistribution of income in a society where inequalities were beginning to mark too deep a furrow between the wealthy and the rest of the citizens. Promise not kept. Indeed, it was precisely during his five-year term that Hollande favored the social democratic turn of a party which until then had jealously preserved its original roots on the left. To the point of creating a disorientation for which the programs of socialists and Gaullists became practically interchangeable, except for negligible nuances, in the name not only of marketism, but even of financial capitalism which seemed to be the only guiding star. And by invoking ""responsibility"" socialists and neo-Gaullists have tried to isolate the extreme wings both on the left and, above all, on the right. By delegating to them, naturally in a completely different way, the defense of the interests of the lower social classes which were increasingly growing as the crises progressed."
26166	11	Although suspected of being an expression of the elites for his curriculum as a first in the class and enfant prodige of investment banks, the first Macron was chosen for the conditioned reflex of stemming the unpresentable xenophobic and racist far right of Marine Le Pen. He reassured the French about his economic policy by pointing out that, although young, he was already sufficiently wealthy to be free from conditioning and in the ideal conditions to govern fairly in favor of all. Except that his first measure was to remove the tax on large fortunes in force since Mitterrand's time. Almost a provocation. Since then, an ostentatious look to the Républicains, the moderate right-wing party, for the formation of its governments. And a series of economic measures that certainly did not go to favor the working class (yes, it still exists in France) if they tended, for example, to precarious work (such as a reform on the Renzi model). Or programs in theory that can be shared on ecological transition but imposed from above and with unsustainable costs in a country exhausted by an unfavorable economic situation. It was rural France that was the first to rebel when it saw the cancellation of train stations, gendarmerie barracks and small community hospitals: the savings on public services, safety and health which were detrimental to the needs of a state which is not alone Paris even if we often tend to identify it with the capital.
26166	13	So after almost two decades of economic policy that has favored the wealthy classes, it is no wonder that voters have rebelled against yet another bill by the executive penalising, the one that raises the retirement age from 62 to 65 years: the most acceptable, if you will, but which represents the classic straw that breaks the camel's back. And they have preferred to choose those who instead promise to commit themselves to maintaining or even reducing the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and to try to reduce the gap between wealth and poverty.
26166	15	The French who get pissed, in the words of Paolo Conte, are the heirs of those who cut off the head of a king and do not disdain revolutions. Now they have sent a signal to the newly elected president, choosing Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the far left and Marine Le Pen on the far right because they have found no other parties in the political market with which they can identify. This is the moral that emerges from the French June. And he questions the political class in France as elsewhere. Because basically the trajectory of many Western democracies have followed the same parable so much that on several occasions we have wondered why there have not yet been social revolts in the face of such an evident assault on rights which had also been achieved with great effort while now it seems normal for a young man to work for 4 euros an hour (if it suits him).
26166	17	Beware of the French lesson. It can teach something to countries, such as Italy, now close to voting.
2617	1	Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega: 'Russia is fighting the Nazis in Ukraine'
2617	3	The president of Nicaragua uses very clear words to comment on what is happening in Ukraine with the special military operation launched by Russia to demilitarize and denazify the Kiev regime. Russia is battling the Nazis in Ukraine, which has been in power since a brutal 2014 coup, reminiscent of attempts to overthrow popular governments in Nicaragua and Venezuela, Sandinista commander Daniel Ortega said.
2617	5	"War is shaking the world and we won't ignore it. Russia fights for its security against the Nazis who rule and kill in Ukraine after the 2014 coup d'état,” the president said during a Workers' Day celebration in Nicaragua.
2617 7 In connection with Labor Day, the Sandinista commander recalled that it was Russia that for the first time in the history of mankind brought workers and peasants to power and defeated Nazism in the decisive battle for humanity"" ."
2617	9	Speaking of Ukraine, Ortega criticized the support of the United States and Europe for the Kiev regime, which has been practicing terrorist acts since the 2014 coup d'état with the support of Western countries.
2617	11	"They're from the same school - homicide, arson. They burned down the House of Trade Unions (in Odessa), where the workers opposed the Nazis, because they were against the coup. It is logical that they took refuge (in the building) with their stones and sticks. And what did the fascists do? They burned more than 40 workers alive, killed them, and all this - with the blessing, encouragement, collusion, resources of US and European imperialism,” Ortega denounced.
26172 1 The physicist Prodi against gretinism: But as CO2, global warming obeys natural cycles"""
26172	3	Rome, July 5 - Does global warming have an anthropic origin? Does this millennial theory based on Co2 scaremongering of which Greta Thunberg is the spokesperson have any vague scientific basis? Professor Franco Prodi, brother of the better known Roman and luminary in his field, is not so sure.
26172	5	"Physicist and academic specializing in meteorological studies and atmospheric physics, member of numerous national and international study commissions, he was director, until 2008, of the Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the CNR. For years he has argued that ""it is not possible, with current knowledge of the climate system, to quantify how much the anthropic effect is"", and that climate changes are cyclical, they have always existed, that there is such a multiplicity of data to consider and that, therefore, it is impossible to make certain long-term forecasts."
26172	7	Professor Prodi against stupid theories on global warming
26172	9	"Instead, we all remember how the illustrious brother and former Prime Minister had applauded the Swedish activist for having ""suddenly awakened an attention that no other media tool would have ever awakened"". His brother has a different opinion: in the aftermath of the tragedy of the Marmolada, which the Italian middle and political class hastened to attribute to global warming and the unsustainable lifestyle of the Italians, the luminary reiterated to La Verità some of his locations."
26172	11	Glacier retreat is cyclical
26172	13	"«There are natural causes and anthropic causes of the changes but the affirmations of the IPCC Reports - the UN committee that would like to study the anthropic contribution to the climate - are scientifically unfounded, theirs are only scenarios, not forecasts on which to base the fate of humanity"". No one here is denying that the planet's temperature is increasing: «We certainly live in a period of global warming and therefore it is clear that every warm period involves a phase of retreat of glaciers with phenomena, of the type that occurred recently. A few years ago I saw the remains of the collapse of one of the famous 5 Towers near the Falzarego». The retreat of the glaciers, however, is nothing new, and ""in the past the Alpine glaciers were even more withdrawn than today"" due to a ""cyclical trend"" that has now lasted for 10 thousand years. «The global warming we are experiencing is a natural fact and part of natural cycles. There is an anthropic component in climate change but it is not currently quantifiable with scientific seriousness""."
26172	15	But the powerful only listen to Thunberg
26172	17	"Casting doubts on the anthropic origin of global warming, Prodi points out, does not mean denying the existence of a pollution alarm ""on a global level, which must naturally be fought, even with binding international agreements: but CO2 is not a polluting gas"". In this regard, the physicist had signed a petition, «together with Italian scientists, taken up by a thousand scientists around the world, warning the political authorities against the supine acceptance of the IPCC recommendations and the consequent ""fight against global warming"". But by now this pseudo Word is so widespread that the requests of our representatives for talks with the political authorities are systematically ignored"". For Professor Prodi, «The hearing granted to Thunberg and denied to our petition says a lot about the discredit that science enjoys in our country. I sadly think - the scientist comments - that the point of no return has been reached»."
26176	1	Don't walk alone: ​​the surreal French handbook against the aggressions of immigrants
26176	3	Rome, July 9 - As the new crime statistics are published and Lyon settles in first place, becoming the most dangerous city in France (63 homicides in 2021 against 61 in Marseille and, as a comparison, 26 in Naples, against 18 in Rome and 19 in Turin), some city groups decide to create a handbook for use above all by women - but not only.
26176	5	Nantes, the handbook to avoid being raped by immigrants
26176	7	"First case in Nantes, the leaflet was proposed with the pleasant title Good behavior to go out in Nantes safely. As if to say, ""don't go looking for it""; a phrase that feminists have always - rightly - hated, but which now becomes obligatory just like the unsaid: that is, the pleonastic immigration-crime equation."
26176	9	But here is the happy formula for going out in complete safety in a normal European city:
26176	11	- Avoid taking out your phone
26176	13	- Choose a jacket with inside pockets and preferably with a zip closure
26176	15	- Pay attention to your glass to avoid being drugged by criminals
26176	17	- Stay on main roads and don't walk on small streets
26176	19	- Do not respond to offenses and insults or catcalling
26176	21	- Choose small bags that can be closed
26176	23	- Do not bring open bags
26176	25	- Don't go home alone
26176	27	- Do not take taxis or ubers alone
26176	29	- Do not take out the pack of cigarettes, do not smoke on the street
26176	31	- Don't stop in isolated places to look for something in your bag or reply to a text
26176	33	- Don't let your friends go home alone
26176	35	- Do not carry your phone in the back pocket of jeans or trousers
26176	37	- In the bus, stay close to the driver
26176	39	The only thing missing: don't wear a miniskirt or a too skimpy dress and wear make-up in moderation, and then the handbook contains more or less everything. Therefore, the moral is, instead of fighting crime, making our cities safe, limiting - or at least controlling - the phenomenon of non-European immigration so that a Western woman is free to go out how, where and when she wants, she is herself to have to protect themselves through «virtuous» behaviours.
26176	41	"The ""Christian veil"" to defend against Muslims"
26176	43	"The situation is so serious in France - and it will soon be in us too - that even one of the latest trends on TikTok is the use of the veil even for non-Muslims: ""the Christian veil and how to put it on in a stylish way"". Yeah, because if you're covered, you're probably a decent girl and less exposed to unwanted attention (and by unwanted attention we mean rape and assault). In fact, a sort of Islamization, a real transposition of Michel Houellebecq's visionary novel, Submission, which speaks of a France now conquered by Islam."
26177	1	"Here is the government's ""sweet"" plan: electricity and gas cuts. And a nice curfew. Tell us now that sanctions work"
26177	3	Rome, 11 July - Light and gas cuts, the government's sweet plan is ready, but the story won't change, they will continue to tell us that the sanctions against Russia work. They will parrot it in omnia media, like sad ventriloquists of the single verb, with the arrogance of sorcerers who know about it. With the most frightened they will resort to answers from Sapientino, because after all for those who live in panciolle we are facing a game for children, not a dramatic reality. And then they will tell us that the situation is all in all under control and that at most we should make some small sacrifices to prevent Putin from winning the war. Small sacrifices that translate into: less heating, less light, less consumption. In a nutshell: more frost and darkness, for a creepy winter.
26177	5	Light and gas cuts, like sugary candy
26177	7	"Read in this way it seems like an ominous prophecy from ominous birds, were it not that the Draghi government is really oriented towards implementing this amazing “emergency plan“. They already call it that, in a Pirandellian way it appears sweeter than a candy, bitter pills to be tasted like sugary beans. Everything will therefore be well dosed, in stages, one small sacrifice at a time. And only if Russia cuts our gas altogether huh. At the moment he has cut ""just"" a third of it."
26177	9	"The executive of the best is calmly preparing the plan, it has foreseen everything, even the ""awareness campaign"". They call it that, this too is an evergreen to sweeten the relentless propaganda aimed at persuading us of the goodness of drastic intervention. Needless to say, it will obviously be the Italian families who pay."
26177	11	The government's plan to leave you in the cold and in the dark
26177	13	"In the ""house plan"" it is assumed to lower the heating and air conditioning temperatures by two degrees. The reduction of the ignition time is also foreseen and also a nice curfew (ah, old sponge of a curfew) in this case not to avoid contagions from Covid. That is (perhaps) water under the bridge, we are facing a leap in quality (errata: leap in quantity) of the restrictions: the curfew in the evening will be for lighting. From micro to macro, from the ""housing plan"" we move on to the ""city plan"": reduction of public lighting up to 40%. In summary: turning on one lamp out of two at night. Even more radical measures have been announced: public offices closed early, at 5.30 pm, shop shutters lowered at 7 pm and a curfew for premises at 11 pm."
26177	15	"And again, one grain at a time, candy after candy, it will also be up to businesses to reduce production consumption. Selectively, it should be clear, only the so-called ""gas interruptibles"" and ""electricity interruptibles"" will initially be involved. Do they seem like terminological supercazzole for disturbing scenarios? But no, the sanctions against Russia work, it's just a matter of small sacrifices. And big chills."
26178	1	Widespread emergencies and the sloth of politics
26178	3	Covid has started running again and unfortunately, restrictive interventions and new measures are already being aired to be implemented in the autumn, with the return of the infamous mask and the advent of a fourth vaccination dose.
26178	5	The health emergency is tinged with new threats every day: monkeypox is only the latest in a worrying series of situations monitored by the WHO. The pandemic is in good company. The war that presses at the gates of the West proves to be ugly, dirty, bad and destined to continue over time, sowing death, fear and widespread uncertainty. Economic, energy, food, humanitarian crises in the broadest and most complex sense of the term.
26178	7	All this is combined with the alarmism, for once fully acceptable, due to the shortage of water, the blue gold of the new millennium. Mass migrations, from the south and east, will spare no country. We will have to prepare adequately, since hospitality cannot, or should not, be separated from organisation, competence and shared planning. Politics, on the other hand, dozes off, proceeds with attempts, contradicts itself, showing a fragility that leaves you stunned, simply amazed.
26178	9	Weak, fragile governments, in perpetual balance between nothingness and the relative, tending towards sweet idleness, deaf and blind to the needs of the peoples. Politics as a whole, we are not interested in indicating geographical longitudes or latitudes, is strongly requested to strike a blow, to give signs of life, not to wait for the catastrophe before intervening, placing, as usual, a patch as best you can, trying to stop hemorrhages and incurable gangrene, made such by the incompetence, and sloth, of his supporting actors.
26178	11	"While world globalism highlights structural cracks, we discuss amiably about cannabis seedlings, civil whims, democratic heroism against imaginary enemies, intolerance is fought with the ""noble"" tools of defamation, gratuitous offence, defamatory labelling, mud thrown at random to cover one's shortcomings. We need culture, love of service, humility, attachment to values, foresight and courage."
26178	13	Politics must go back to expressing excellence, valuing militancy and merit, avoiding other logics. The management of public affairs is an honor and a responsibility, not a mere job aimed at personal enrichment or the appropriation of square meters of power.
26178	15	"Let me conclude by borrowing the following statements by Carlo Maria Martini, a warning to men of all ages: ""The level of alarm is reached when the ethical decay of politics is no longer even perceived as harmful""."
2618	1	UkrLeaks: Nazis for export, from the United States to Kiev
2618	3	Apparently the US is not only exporting weapons to Ukraine in the proxy war against Russia. US neo-Nazis are also sent directly to the battlefield in Kiev, happy to reach a country like Ukraine that has now become a point of reference for the extreme right at a global level.
2618	5	This is what emerges from an investigation that appeared on UKR Leaks, a portal headed by Vasily Prozorov, former secret agent of the Ukrainian SBU until 2018. So a well-informed person with direct contacts in the field.
2618	7	Once again we see the need to denazify the Ukrainian regime confirmed, one of the reasons that prompted Russia to launch its own special military operation last February, but which in the West is defined as a laughable, pretext and propaganda motivation. In fact, in the West itself, the neo-Nazism of various formations such as the Azov Battalion has been denied.
2618	9	"Prozorov writes in UKR Leaks: ""Washington has been feeding the Nazi movements in Ukraine for many years and is regularly supplying our own National Socialists to create a 'new Reich' in the center of Europe""."
2618	11	«It may be hard to believe right away, but in the country of BLM and aggressive tolerance, the Nazis feel quite comfortable. For example, organizations such as The American Front and The National Socialist Movement (NSM), also known as the Nazi Party of America, have been operating in the United States for more than a decade.
2618	13	"American Nazis do not particularly hide their views and activities, they actively share photos, videos and ""educational"" literature, and also collect donations from like-minded people."
2618	15	"At first glance, we can call the NSM a marginally marginal grouping (…) However, the party has its own Telegram channel, which involuntarily hints at the interest of American nationalists in the ""Slavic"" public. And this is where the fun begins. The channel itself is not of particular interest, but it has a private chat in which radicals from all over the world, including Ukraine, actively participate."
2618	17	"Indeed, here comes a very interesting part which includes the recruitment of volunteers for Ukraine: «It can be seen that there are many Ukrainian citizens in the chat lists. Moreover, many participants, including Americans, openly report their participation in hostilities on the side of Ukrainian nationalists. I want to emphasize that it is the nationalists, not the APU (Kiev Armed Forces)! In particular we talk about ""Azov"" and ""Right Sector"". The chat also supports the Battalion's recruitment campaign»."
2618	19	"We then read in the investigation: «It is quite clear that among the radicals the Kiev government enjoys neither respect nor support. Accusations of an anti-Semitic nature are being brought against V. Zelensky. On the contrary, the Nazis see in Ukraine the real ""new Reich"", the core of which should be ""Azov"". The ""Fuhrer"", apparently, should be A. Biletsky. This idea is expressed by some of the most active chat participants."
26181	1	Super Mario's dilemma
26181	3	When the time for the irresponsible strikes, perceptions are altered: urgency becomes ordinary administration, drama dissolves in crazy days of recreation. It seems like a century has passed since Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's nightly press conferences, in the midst of the pandemic, who exaggerated the anguish of Italians locked up at home with verbose monologues. Yet now it is the Five Star leader himself who is playing a desperate personal game, devoted to removing the context that led to the Draghi government.
26181	5	The Prime Minister watches with phlegm the contortions of the Five Stars, the weak and unreliable link of an increasingly less armored and increasingly intolerant majority. Draghi doesn't like apodictic sentences or media shots, in fact he meditates and broods. The former president of the ECB, the technocrat called by the most responsible parties to commission a weak policy, appears appalled by the dilemma indirectly posed by the ramshackle grillina brigade. Continue with a semi-war agenda or parade before a government structure different from the one sworn in at the Quirinale in February 2021.
26181	7	In seventeen months the internal and international picture remains explosive, at the moment no one can formulate an exit from the red zone amidst the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, the cost of living which erodes increasingly meager incomes and profits, the tail end of a pandemic which it has entangled us in the nightmare of a systematic contagion. Italy, like many countries, is traveling through a dark tunnel whose exit cannot be seen. Only the Five Stars, who rant about abstention and government reshuffles, have decided by narrow political calculation to disregard the founding reasons for an emergency government based on national unity. They are the ones who have opened a crack, not so much numerical given the continuous decline in parliamentary weight, but in terms of re-discussing an alliance that is more patriotic than political. At a time when there is the greatest need for national cohesion, Conte and his Japanese in the jungle think in terms of petty tactics. Russia cuts off our gas and they curse Di Maio's split, Putin threatens an apocalyptic scenario and they play at wearing down the Prime Minister on electoral clientele such as basic income. If they leave the government, a way will be found to remedy the damage inflicted by the welfare policies imposed by the decadent visions of Beppe Grillo. And if we go back to voting sooner than expected, the Italians will have the opportunity to dismiss the true populism of the improvised people in power, those who can't distinguish a war from a quarrel in the corridor.
26185	1	"Lukashenko to the ""international scammers"" of the pandemic: ""That's enough!"""
26185	3	"Lukashenko to the ""international scammers"" of the pandemic: ""That's enough!"""
26185	5	Yesterday in a press conference the Belarusian president disavowed the entire pandemic narrative, carried out by the globalists to destroy the middle class
26185	7	"“I want to say to all these international scammers: that's enough. They have already emptied our pockets so much that there is nothing left. They stripped everyone. It is necessary to end this pandemic. Enough, they've already fooled people."" The question is put in no uncertain terms by Aleksandr Lukashenko, president of Belarus, who since the first months of 2020 has made his country a bulwark against health care dictatorships. Unlike the rest of Europe, in fact, 'White Russia' has faced Covid only on the health level, without ever imposing restrictions on civil and individual freedom, and the premier ended up in the crosshairs of media servitude when in the summer of 2020 he openly accused the WHO of having offered him 940 million euros to impose in his country the same liberticidal measures imposed in Italy. With Putin behind him, Lukashenko has never bowed to globalist interests, always unmasking the political game of economic and political destruction of the Western world that lies behind the ""pandemic""."
26185	9	Yesterday he said what everyone knows by now, except the Italian media, with Omicron Covid is now little more than a flu, urging his fellow citizens not to be afraid: “One of them, an American or Western expert, said: 'If Omicron is such an easy virus, let's all get sick and it will be a vaccine for us. From my point of view, a perfect suggestion”
2619	1	Covid, while Europe carries out the 'Japanese' Speranza remains in the pandemic jungle
2619	3	“The time has come for Sweden to open up again,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference.
2619	5	Sweden has decided to lift the restrictions (mild, however) for the pandemic next week, while the country, while still registering fairly sustained levels of infection, relies on surging immunity due to booster shots, immunity acquired by recovered and at manageable hospitalization levels to keep Covid at bay, reports the Reuters agency.
2619	7	Sweden had extended its current pandemic measures, which include early closures for bars and restaurants and a 500-person limit on indoor events, for another two weeks in late January. In general, however, in Stockholm they faced the pandemic without hysteria and relying on common sense.
2619	9	The Swedish government's decision is in line with what has been decided by other European governments who have decided to deal with Covid as if it were a flu, stating that we are at the end of the pandemic phase with the endemization of the virus.
2619	11	From 9 February, practically all the restrictions of the past will be abolished, as has already happened in Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Finland. No vaccination certificate will be mandatory anywhere.
2619	13	However, the Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza is still barricaded in the pandemic jungle, like the Japanese soldiers after the Second World War. In fact, in Rome, the extension of the green pass, red zones and limitations for the unvaccinated are still being discussed.
2619	15	As a rule, on every issue it is at the center of the political debate - because even the pandemic is a political and not a health issue - the Italian rulers look towards Europe, will it be different for the pandemic and the endless restrictions that have marked the last two years?
26191	1	It wasn't çovid that killed people but it was the lockdowns.
26191	3	"14/06/2022 - It wasn't Covid that killed people but it was the lockdowns. The flu virus called COVID has not claimed as many lives as the common seasonal flu. It was the forced confinements that caused the anomaly of deaths. Now it is the scientists themselves who say it. Locking people up at home, suspending treatment with ""watchful waiting and tachypirine"" killed people. Finally, a large part of the population has understood this and now there is no city, no place, where the Minister of Health Speranza goes that he is not shouted ""MURDERER"". It happened in Palermo, Messina, Bologna, Forenze, etc."
26191	5	"The global coup via the ""pandemic"" failed thanks to men like Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Víctor Orban and Aleksandr Lukashenko who was the first to denounce the attempted corruption by the Davos elite. At the end of this story, those responsible must be brought to justice."
26196	1	Let's play French
26196	3	Let's play a political game, actually a political fantasy. Let's pretend that we are French, or that the French are us, with all their institutional and electoral system. So let's imagine that Emmanuel Macron is Enrico Letta, that Marine Le Pen is Giorgia Meloni, Jean Luc Mélenchon is Giuseppe Conte, Eric Zemmour is Matteo Salvini, and gradually all the others descend, with the Gaullist Valerie Pecresse in the role of Silvio Berlusconi and the socialist Anne Hidalgo in those of the more leftist left, that is Pier Luigi Bersani, Roberto Speranza, Nicola Fratoianni. In addition, but very lateral, the other defeated French candidates who in Italy could be embodied by Matteo Renzi, Carlo Calenda and centrists of various order and rank. Of course we have to play as if we were in a semi-presidential system, precisely in the French style, in which the president of the republic is elected by the people and is essentially the head of the government, with a two-round electoral law which provides for a run-off between the first two arrivals . The others have to make do with a small right to the rostrum and electoral reimbursements should they exceed 5 percent of the votes.
26196	5	According to the polls available to us, Letta and Meloni would go to the ballot, a direct challenge between right and left that recalls those between Prodi and Berlusconi in 1996 and 2006. In this case, however, there would be no coalition of five, six, seven or even nine parties to support the two candidates, with consequent and legitimate claims from ministries and undersecretariats, mixed blackmail and little cabotage games, but at most explanations of vote for one or the other. Exactly as is happening in France these days. Then, after the result, it will be up to whoever wins to open or not his government to some representative of the minor forces who have invited their electors to vote for him or her. In any case, the victor will have a lot of power, just enough to allow him to govern for the entire legislature.
26196	7	So let's see how all the athletes on the pitch could play the game. The two protagonists will try to acquire the votes available on the square, Letta will have the most difficult task having to turn to both the left and the center, or will have to try to propose a program that can convince Conte, Bersani, Fratoianni, Renzi and Calenda, and not the it will be enough to appeal to a sort of popular front against the right: instead it will have to make an effort to explain to voters what it intends to do on all the issues on the agenda of a country that will not have emerged from the economic crisis, caused by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine. Put simply, he will have to expose himself on taxes, that is, who has to pay more and who less, on the recipients of the few available resources, on civil rights, on immigrants and so on. It will not be easy for him to convince the leaders and voters who are so different and very often at odds with each other to vote for him, especially the grillini and the left-wing radicals who do not like (euphemism) the Renzians and the Calendians. And viceversa.
26196	9	"For Meloni the game seems simpler, after all the values ​​(let's call them that) of the Italian right are very similar if not the same. What would be the differences between the Brothers of Italy and the League? Very few, so it is very likely that Salvini's voters would vote convinced and en masse for Giorgia Meloni. The situation for those who still identify with Forza Italia is slightly different: although the ""fear"" of the left, of the communists, the Cavaliere would say, may also apply to them, some would not feel at ease with a sovereign and substantially anti-European president, for more escorted by Salvini. As well as the same voters of Renzi and Calenda, who would hardly vote for Meloni at the Quirinale. While among the Cinquestelle, where we find people who come from the left together with others who have a history and a culture that has nothing to do with the left, there could be someone who can give his vote to Meloni. Perhaps recalling the ""good times"" of the alliance with the sovereignist Salvini."
26196	11	So long live the French system that would allow us to have a President elected directly by the people, who could govern in peace for five years, without obstacles, blackmail and veto rights of the parties? Or better to keep our system, in which the people vote for the parties who then represent them in Parliament, which in turn elects the prime minister, who must answer to Parliament, as will Parliament, i.e. the parties that make it up, which in the following elections will he have to give an account to the people of what has or has not been done? From the point of view of functionality, governance, efficiency and speed of decisions, it is clear that the first hypothesis would be better. But from that of democracy, pluralism and representation, the latter would be better. Let's put it this way: if Giorgia Meloni were elected directly by the citizens, then we would have to keep her in Palazzo Chigi, indeed at the Quirinale, for five years. If, on the other hand, you become prime minister by the will of the majority of parliamentarians, this will could also change overnight. Here, better not to risk it.
26199	1	Scholz: The EU is the antithesis of imperialism and autocracy
26199	3	The European Union can no longer afford national vetoes in foreign policy: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz writes this in an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dedicated to the consequences for Germany and Europe of the Russian war in Ukraine. “Imperialism is back in Europe. Many hoped that the close economic ties and mutual dependencies would ensure stability and security at the same time. Putin has now visibly destroyed that hope with his war against Ukraine. Russian missiles have not only caused massive destruction in Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson, but have also reduced the European and international peace order of the past decades to rubble,” writes the Social Democratic Chancellor.
26199	5	"Scholz advocates the need for a ""geopolitical European Union"": for the German chancellor, the member countries must close ranks in all the policies on which there has been disagreement so far, such as migration policy, common defence, technological sovereignty. The federal government, writes Scholz, will make proposals on the matter in the coming months. The German chancellor then stresses that we need to put an end to the ""selfish blocks of European decisions by individual member states""."
26205	1	Russia is preparing for the offensive on the home front
26205	3	24 May 2022 Russia is preparing for the offensive on the home front
26205	5	In conditions where it is impossible to break Russia by external aggression, Western politicians are preparing an internal destabilization of Russia
26205	7	During his speech to the 30th Assembly of the Foreign and Defense Policy Council, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, describing the current situation, explained that “the collective West” has declared an all-out hybrid war against us. It is by no means an exaggeration, the French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, announced an all-out financial and economic war against Russia in March of this year.
26205	9	The fight against external dangers is evident to everyone and the willingness to do so is greater, at the same time the fight on the internal front has always been the most difficult, and this internal front is precisely the battleground on which the countries of the ' West are now trying to organize against Russia..
26205	11	"During his visit to Europe after Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine, US President Joe Biden said on March 26 that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot stay in power. Shortly thereafter, a White House spokesman clarified that Biden had not called for a change of power in Russia: ""The president believes that Putin should not be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors."""
26205	13	However, one must understand that such a statement by Biden is by no means an improvisation of an elderly person shocking the public with his speeches. Speaking in Warsaw, they read a text prepared by a teleprompter, only one of the authors of this speech was too frank. The official authorities in the West are not ready to enter into direct conflict with Russia, as this is fraught with the danger of a third world war, and therefore they publicly deny their intentions to change power in Russia.
26205	15	"""Regime change in Russia is not NATO's goal,"" explained German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “We are not looking for regime change in Moscow. But let me be clear: a weakened Russia is a consequence of Putin's decision to launch an unwarranted invasion, said British Foreign Office chief Liz Truss."
26205	17	All of these claims are not credible. Already on December 7, 2021, during her testimony to the US Senate, Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained that it was planned to isolate Russia from the global financial system, with all the ensuing consequences for business Russians and their population. At the same time, Reuters, citing an unnamed White House official, reported that the pending sanctions would severely impact Russian consumers, businesses and employment.
26205	19	It is also worth paying attention to the publication in the American magazine The Atlantic, written by a former adviser to the US State Department. Earlier, in March 2021, before all the aggravations in Ukraine began, I drew the readers' attention to one of the articles by former American diplomats, in which they shared their plans for Ukraine, and concluded that the United States would try to take revenge there and take this country under its control.
26205	21	This time, the former US official quoted by The Atlantic is saying bluntly that the US should signal to the Russian elite that the country has no future under the presidency of Vladimir Putin. Russia under Vladimir Putin is a deeply dangerous state, says the article.
26205	23	It is in the interests of the West to keep Russia weak, internally divided and militarily impotent. Under such conditions, although the “liberalizing revolution” may come, there is no reason to act as if it has already arrived or is inevitable, the author believes.
26205	25	Therefore, even when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is resolved and official sanctions are lifted, it makes sense by all possible means to discourage Western companies from doing business there in order to stir up public discontent.
26205	27	"Therefore, the United States has not hidden and is not hiding that its goal is to put pressure on ordinary Russians to change the policy of the Russian leadership and, possibly, the entire leadership. Now US Senator Lindsey Graham, explaining the need to allocate 40 billion dollars to Ukraine, says that there is a chance of defeating Russia. Otherwise, her actions will change the face of Europe and send the ""wrong signals"" to China. You do not hesitate to say that one of the US goals is a change of power in Russia."
26205	29	Lindsey Graham, a 66-year-old neocon and US “deep state” representative who has maintained a Russophobic streak under Donald Trump's presidency, has previously said that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power. Of course, it is not only in the US Congress, the House of Representatives has also approved the bill on the allocation of 40 billion dollars to Ukraine with an overwhelming majority of 388 votes in favor and 57 against.
26205	31	US foreign policy veteran Henry Kissinger told the Financial Times in an interview that the US is being forced to engage in regime change in authoritarian countries as authoritarian regimes multiply new types of ever more destructive and sophisticated weapons that could threaten the United States. Of course, all this was said with reference to the confrontation between the USA and Russia in Ukraine.
26205	33	However, the reign of the neocons and this approach to foreign policy in the United States is coming to an end. Senator Rand Paul, introducing his amendment to the bill, temporarily blocked the allocation of 40 billion dollars to Kiev. Explaining his actions, he stated that he did not want Ukraine to succeed at the cost of US failure.
26205	35	Other Republicans have also spoken out publicly against bailouts for Ukraine because spending dollars in another country means the federal government can't control the Mexican border and young parents can't find infant formula for their children.
26205	37	Donald Trump Jr. and the new Republican candidates are strongly against helping Ukraine, explaining that the money will go to war and bribe officials in the United States itself. Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, who won the Republican Party primaries, was alone among the contenders who opposed American intervention in the situation in Ukraine.
26205	39	Even the New York Times , which has always adhered to the point of view of the Democratic Party of the United States, in the matter of providing 40 billion in aid to Ukraine, dwells on the ease with which American lawmakers on both sides give the money of the taxpayers to another country, although more recently they have fought each other to finance their own citizens, trying to balance the costs.
26205	41	All this suggests that the current ruling elites in the United States do not have much time, as the problems of the United States require urgent solutions. Therefore, they are starting to twist the situation to destabilize Russia right now. So, for example, the US CIA distributed instructions in Russian explaining how to get in touch with them on the Internet.
26205	43	"The CIA asks people using the instructions to give their full name, their official position, and what access they have to information of interest to US intelligence. According to the Washington Post, the instruction was published in connection with the desire of US intelligence to establish contact with the Russians, who were ""concerned"" by a special military operation in Ukraine. Therefore, the American side intends to step up the recruitment of Russians."
26205	45	Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director Sergei Naryshkin said the US State Department had instructed controlled non-governmental organizations to launch a campaign to discredit the military operation in Ukraine in Russian society. The general message circulating on social media is that Western-backed Ukraine is about to inflict a crushing defeat on Russia and “only a large-scale civil protest is supposedly able to save the country from an imminent catastrophe”.
26205	47	For his part, the Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov described the cynicism of the situation : “The horror is that well-known (US) politicians, whom I previously quite respected, whose knowledge I highly valued, publish appeals in the Media Americans to Russian diplomats and the military to go over to the side of so-called democracy. In fact, my comrades are driven to betrayal, which in any country is considered a disgusting act, ”he said on Solovyov Live.
26205	49	“My comrades, embassy staff, are receiving threats, including physical violence. And American intelligence figures flirt around the Russian embassy, ​​handing out FBI and CIA phones, which they offer to call to establish “cooperation” contacts. “Targeted mailings are sent to mobile phone numbers, ads with addresses of special services and invitations to respond to these appeals,” Antonov said.
26205	51	"Therefore, it is not surprising that the American “Radio Liberty”, included by the Russian Ministry of Justice in the list of media acting as foreign agents, introduces the idea that “Russian elites understand that the war is lost”. However, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) has now ""dragged out of mothballs"" Mikhail Kasyanov, a former Russian statesman who has now left Russia and is in hiding in Europe."
26205	53	In the above interview, it was the DW reporter who set the tone with a bias towards a change of power in Russia. Kasyanov himself expressed the hope that Western sanctions would hit the Russian middle class with constant access to the Internet, and through this communication channel Kasyanov's supporters would be able to influence the situation in Russia to change the current government.
26205	55	Therefore, it is obvious that the current level of Western agitation calling for a change of power in Russia has already surpassed the level of the Soviet era. Undisguised agitation is carried out not only in relation to ordinary Russians, but also in relation to diplomats and civil servants.
26205	57	Russia is now in a situation where external pressure cannot break it and only an internal explosion can divide the country. The Russian people just need to show patience and wait out the storm to break the world order, because Russia has all the necessary resources for that. Then the people will not have to rebuild the country from the rubble, as has already happened in our history, but it will be possible to build a new world order based on the interests of Russia.
26210	1	Moscow and Beijing: The US aims to transform insects into biological weapons
26210	3	Riad main recipient of funds for the Chinese Silk Road in the first half of 2022
26210	5	The Russian special operation in Ukraine has uncovered the Pandora's box of US biolaboratories in the former Soviet republic, which however are only a few of the dozens of laboratories of this type that the USA manages all over the world. During the special operation, the Russians came into possession of burning documents that nail Washington to its responsibilities, despite the fact that the Western press continues to ignore the issue.
26210	7	Igor Kirillov, head of the Russian Federation's Radioactive, Chemical and Biological Protection Force, recently revealed new information that seriously questions the safety standards of Ukrainian biolaboratories. According to documents in the possession of the Russians, the USA had allocated about 15 million dollars to increase the level of security of the laboratory in Merefa, a city in the Kharkiv oblast, however the Ukrainian officials replied that the modernization of the security system would been impossible, until the facility was commissioned in violation of safety regulations and requirements. This also means that nobody knows where the 15 million disbursed by the US authorities have gone.
26210	9	Kirillov also revealed that the searches in Ukraine were supported not only by the United States, but also by Poland and Germany. However, none of the countries involved has had the foresight to notify the United Nations of the existence of this joint project. Kirillov recalled that each signatory to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is required to submit an annual report to demonstrate the compliance of their research with the terms of the international agreement, however, in the declarations presented by Ukraine, the United States, Poland and Germany there is no is no trace of research carried out in Ukrainian biolaboratories.
26210	11	"Lt. Gen. Kirillov stressed that Ukraine said in reports for 2016-2020 that its government had not conducted and was not conducting any offensive or defensive activities under biological research and development programs, according to reports by the TASS news agency. “This contradicts the statement made by Lewis Gitter, Deputy Political Advisor to the US Mission to the OSCE, on May 20, 2022,” the Russian official explained. At the time, Gitter said aid had been sent to Kiev ""to reduce biological threats and support veterinary and public health to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks"" and ""to secure illegal biological weapons left behind in former Soviet states."" after the fall of the USSR“."
26210	13	“It begs a question: why was the work under the joint military biological projects codenamed UP not mentioned in the reports submitted by the US and Ukraine to the UN? This secrecy is a reason to question the real goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine,” Kirillov commented. As we ourselves had already had the opportunity to underline in previous articles, Kirillov pointed out the existence of reports from the Ukrainian secret services about the activity of US biolaboratories in Ukraine, which were considered as a threat by the same intelligence in Kiev.
26210	15	"In recent days, an article by Shan Jie and Fan Wei published in the Chinese newspaper Global Times raised the question of the US program known as ""Insect Allies"", which could transform insects into lethal biological weapons. The Pentagon project involves transmitting genetically modified viruses to plants by altering crop genes. Officially, the project would serve to avoid famines, allowing agriculture in unfavorable climates and defending plants from diseases, but in reality this project can be used as a weapon, obtaining exactly the opposite effect, namely that of destroying foodstuffs of the enemy, or to spread deadly diseases among the population."
26210	17	“Why do they use insects as vectors? Why is the US building bio-labs near other countries like Russia? When Pandora's box is opened, a series of disasters will follow,” said an expert interviewed by the Global Times.
26210	19	However, this project represents only the tip of the iceberg of the many covert operations conducted by the United States around the planet. In addition to the Insect Allies program, the United States has conducted biological experiments all over the world in their biolaboratories, violating all international conventions in this regard, as well as the rules of safety and ethics.
26210	21	The Insect Allies project was launched in 2017 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for developing high-tech military applications. As early as April 2018, an article in Science warned that the US defense project could turn insects into biological weapons. “If successful, the technique could be used by malicious actors to help spread disease to nearly any crop species and devastate crops,” read the well-known scientific journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which pointed out also that “the research could be considered as a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention“.
26210	23	"Similar comments were provided by Germany's Max Planck Institute, according to which the insects in the project ""could easily be misused for the development of biological weapons"", and by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), an international organization which deals with environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry. According to SETAC, “the combination of a virus-induced genetic modification of field-grown plants using genetically modified insect vectors poses a greater risk than the hitherto existing use of genetically modified organisms.” “Due to the broad prohibition of the Biological Weapons Convention, any biological research of interest must be plausibly justified as serving peaceful purposes. The Insect Allies program could violate the Biological Weapons Convention, if the reasons presented by DARPA are implausible“, Observed the Teutonic institute instead."
26210	25	“It would be deadly to turn an insect into a biological weapon, because until now viruses in crops have been very difficult to control. Once an infected crop develops symptoms, it is nearly impossible to save. And the virus continues to vary, making prevention even more difficult,” said Zhang Jie, an expert at the Plant Protection Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
26210	27	The Insect Allies program, as we mentioned earlier, is just one of many instances where US research has been accused of causing dire consequences around the world, especially through the use of biological laboratories. The United States has openly admitted that it operates 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries of the world, including 26 in Ukraine. However, there are enough documents to state that the US has signed contracts with at least 49 countries.
26210	29	One of these countries, in addition to the aforementioned Ukraine, is the other former Soviet republic of Georgia. In 2014, the US-built Lugar Center near Tbilisi was equipped with an insect facility and launched a project called “Raising Awareness about Barcoding of Sand Flies in Georgia and Caucasus”. A few months later, Tbilisi was infested with biting flies which developed behavior atypical of what they had previously displayed, including extraordinary longevity and resistance to cold. Biting flies have also been found in the neighboring Dagestan region of Russia.
26210	31	All this must raise serious questions about what are the real intentions of the United States regarding the numerous researches that they conduct illegally all over the world, without adequately informing the international bodies in charge.
26219	1	Communications from President Draghi to the Senate of the Republic
26219	3	Mister President,
26219	5	Honorable Senators and Senators,
26219	7	Last Thursday I handed in my resignation to the President of the Republic.
26219	9	This decision followed the loss of the majority of national unity that has supported this government since its inception.
26219	11	The President of the Republic rejected my resignation and asked me to inform Parliament of what happened – a decision I shared.
26219	13	Today's Communications allow me to explain to you and to all Italians the reasons for a choice that was as painful as it was due.
26219	15	Last February, the President of the Republic entrusted me with the task of forming a government to deal with the three emergencies facing Italy: pandemic, economic, social.
26219	17	"""A government"" - these were his words - ""of a high profile, which should not be identified with any political formula""."
26219	19	"""A government that promptly deals with serious emergencies that cannot be postponed""."
26219	21	All the main parties - with one exception - decided to respond positively to that appeal.
26219	23	"In the inauguration speech I gave in this hall, I explicitly referred to the ""republican spirit"" of the government, which would be based on the assumption of national unity."
26219	25	In recent months, national unity has been the best guarantee of the democratic legitimacy of this executive and its effectiveness.
26219	27	I believe that a Prime Minister who has never presented himself before the electors must have the broadest possible support in Parliament.
26219	29	This assumption is even more important in an emergency context, in which the Government has to make decisions that profoundly affect the lives of Italians.
26219	31	"The very broad consensus that the Government enjoyed in Parliament allowed for that ""timeliness"" in the decisions that the President of the Republic had requested."
26219	33	For a long time the forces of the majority have been able to put aside divisions and converge with a sense of state and generosity towards rapid and effective interventions, for the good of all citizens.
26219	35	Thanks to the health containment measures, the vaccination campaign, the economic support measures for families and businesses, we have managed to overcome the most acute phase of the pandemic, to give impetus to the economic recovery.
26219	37	The boost to investments and the protection of household incomes has allowed us to emerge faster than other countries from the recession caused by the pandemic.
26219	39	Last year the economy grew by 6.6% and the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product fell by 4.5 percentage points.
26219	41	The drafting of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, approved with a very large majority by this Parliament, has launched a path of reforms and investments that is unprecedented in recent history.
26219	43	The reforms of justice, competition, taxation, procurement - in addition to the substantial simplification agenda - are an essential step forward for modernizing Italy.
26219	45	To date, all the objectives of the first two semesters of the PNRR have been achieved.
26219	47	We have already received 45.9 billion euros from the European Commission, to which a further 21 billion will be added in the coming weeks - for a total of almost 67 billion.
26219	49	With the strong parliamentary support of the majority and the opposition, we reacted with absolute firmness to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
26219	51	Condemnation of Russian atrocities and full support for Ukraine have shown how Italy can and should have a leading role within the European Union and the G7.
26219	53	At the same time, we have never ceased our pursuit of peace – a peace that must be acceptable to Ukraine, sustainable, lasting.
26219	55	We were among the first to commit ourselves so that Russia and Ukraine could work together to avoid a food catastrophe, and at the same time open a window of negotiation.
26219	57	The progress recorded in Turkey last week is encouraging, and we hope it can be consolidated.
26219	59	We have moved very quickly to overcome the unacceptable energy dependence on Russia – the result of decades of short-sighted and dangerous choices.
26219	61	In just a few months, we have reduced our imports of Russian gas from 40% to less than 25% of the total and intend to bring them to zero within a year and a half.
26219	63	It is a result that seemed unthinkable, which gives peace of mind for the future to industry and families, strengthens our national security, our credibility in the world.
26219	65	We have accelerated, with profound simplifications and massive investments, on the renewable energy front, to defend the environment and increase our energy independence.
26219	67	And we have intervened with determination to protect citizens and businesses from the consequences of the energy crisis, with particular attention to the weakest.
26219	69	We have allocated 33 billion in just over a year, almost two percentage points of GDP, despite our limited public finance margins.
26219	71	We were able to do this thanks to a newfound collective credibility, which contained the increase in the cost of debt even in a phase of rising interest rates.
26219	73	The credit for these results was yours - for your willingness to put aside your differences and work for the good of the country, with equal dignity, with mutual respect.
26219	75	Yours was the best response to last February's appeal from the President of the Republic and to the request for seriousness, the need for protection, the concerns for the future that came from citizens.
26219	77	The Italians have in turn supported this civil miracle, and have become the real protagonists of the policies that we implemented from time to time.
26219	79	I am thinking of the patient respect for the restrictions to curb the pandemic, of the extraordinary participation in the vaccination campaign.
26219	81	I am thinking of the spontaneous welcome offered to Ukrainian refugees, welcomed into homes and schools with affection and solidarity.
26219	83	I am thinking of the involvement of local communities in the PNRR, which has made it the largest grassroots transformation project in recent history.
26219	85	Never as in these moments have I been proud to be Italian.
26219	87	Italy is strong when it knows how to be united.
26219	89	Unfortunately, as the months went by, the political forces opposed this demand for cohesion that came from the citizens with a growing desire for distinction and division.
26219	91	The reforms of the Superior Council of the Judiciary, of the cadastre, of the seaside concessions have shown a progressive crumbling of the majority on the country's modernization agenda.
26219	93	In foreign policy, we have seen attempts to undermine government support for Ukraine, to weaken our opposition to President Putin's agenda.
26219	95	Calls for more borrowing grew louder just as the need for attention to debt sustainability was greatest.
26219	97	"The desire to move forward together has gradually faded and with it the ability to act effectively, with ""timeliness"", in the interest of the country."
26219	99	As I said in the Council of Ministers, last Thursday's vote certified the end of the pact of trust that held this majority together.
26219	101	Not voting confidence in a government you belong to is a clear political gesture, which has an obvious meaning.
26219	103	It cannot be ignored, because it would be tantamount to ignoring Parliament.
26219	105	It is not possible to contain it, because it would mean that anyone can repeat it.
26219	107	It cannot be minimized, because it comes after months of snatches and ultimatums.
26219	109	The only way, if we still want to stay together, is to rebuild this pact from scratch, with courage, altruism, credibility.
26219	111	It is mainly the Italians who ask for it.
26219	113	The mobilization of these days by citizens, associations, territories in favor of the continuation of the Government is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.
26219	115	It involved the third sector, school and university, the world of the economy, professions and entrepreneurship, sport.
26219	117	This is undeserved support, but one for which I am enormously grateful.
26219	119	Two appeals struck me in a particular way.
26219	121	The first is that of around 2,000 mayors, authorities used to dealing with the problems of their communities on a daily basis.
26219	123	The second is that of healthcare personnel, the heroes of the pandemic, to whom our collective gratitude is immense.
26219	125	This question of stability requires us all to decide whether it is possible to recreate the conditions in which the government can truly govern.
26219	127	This is the heart of our discussion today.
26219	129	This is the sense of the commitment we have to deal with before the citizens.
26219	131	Italy needs a government capable of moving effectively and promptly on at least four fronts.
26219	133	The National Recovery and Resilience Plan is a unique opportunity to improve our long-term growth, create opportunities for young people and women, heal inequalities starting from those between North and South.
26219	135	By the end of this year, we must achieve 55 goals, which will allow us to receive a new installment of 19 billion euros.
26219	137	The objectives concern fundamental issues such as digital infrastructures, support for tourism, the creation of university accommodation and research scholarships, the fight against undeclared work.
26219	139	Completing the PNRR is a matter of seriousness towards our citizens and towards our European partners.
26219	141	If we don't show that we know how to spend this money efficiently and honestly, it will be impossible to ask for new common crisis management tools.
26219	143	The advancement of the PNRR requires the realization of the many investments that make it up.
26219	145	From railways to broadband, from nursery schools to community houses, we must commit ourselves to realizing all the projects we have designed with the decisive contribution of local communities.
26219	147	We must be united against useless bureaucracy, which too often delays the country's development.
26219	149	And we must make sure that local authorities - starting with the Municipalities - have all the necessary tools to overcome any implementation problems.
26219	151	At the same time, we must proceed quickly with the reforms which, together with investment, are at the heart of the PNRR.
26219	153	The reform of the public procurement code intends to ensure the rapid completion of public works and the strengthening of the tools for the fight against corruption.
26219	155	We must keep the mafias away from the PNRR.
26219	157	It's the best way to honor the memory of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the men and women of their escorts, thirty years after their barbaric killing.
26219	159	The reform of the procurement code has been approved, and work is underway to prepare the outlines of delegated decrees which must be dismissed by March next year.
26219	161	Competition reform serves to promote growth, reduce rents, encourage investment and employment.
26219	163	In this spirit, we have approved regulations to remove the obstacles to market opening and consumer protection.
26219	165	The reform affects local public services, including taxis, and concessions for goods and services, including beach concessions.
26219	167	The bill must be approved before the summer break, to allow further approval of the delegated decrees by the end of the year, as required by the PNRR.
26219	169	What is now needed is convinced support for executive action – not support for unauthorized, and sometimes violent, protests against the ruling majority.
26219	171	As far as justice is concerned, we approved the reform of the criminal trial, the civil trial and the bankruptcy procedures and brought the tax justice reform to Parliament.
26219	173	These reforms are essential to have fair and rapid processes, as the Italians ask us.
26219	175	It is a matter of freedom, democracy, and also prosperity.
26219	177	The deadlines set by the PNRR are very precise.
26219	179	We have to complete the procedure envisaged for the implementation decrees of the civil and criminal enabling law by the end of the year.
26219	181	The tax justice reform law is under discussion in the Senate and must be approved by the end of the year.
26219	183	Finally, last autumn, the Government gave the go-ahead for the draft law for the revision of the tax authorities.
26219	185	We are aware that taxation in Italy is complex and often unfair.
26219	187	This is why we have never raised taxes on citizens.
26219	189	However, for this it is necessary to proceed with an effort of transparency.
26219	191	We intend to reduce the personal income tax rates starting from low-middle incomes; overcome the IRAP; rationalize VAT.
26219	193	The first steps were taken with the latest budget law, which initiated the revision of the Irpef and the reform of the collection system.
26219	195	In Italy, the Revenue-Collection Agency counts 1,100 billion euros of residual credits, i.e. uncollected, equal to over 60% of the national gross domestic product – an impressive figure.
26219	197	We must therefore approve the tax reform as soon as possible, which includes the completion of the tax collection reform, and launch the implementing decrees immediately afterwards.
26219	199	Alongside the PNRR, there is a need for a real social agenda, which starts with the weakest, such as the disabled and the elderly who are not self-sufficient.
26219	201	Rising energy costs and the return of inflation have caused new inequalities, which aggravate those produced by the pandemic.
26219	203	Since the inception of the government, we have shared a working method with the trade unions and business associations that provides for regular meetings and roundtables.
26219	205	This method has already been used to manage some emergencies in the country: from the resumption of production activities in the pandemic phase to job security, on which much has been done and much still remains to be done.
26219	207	Today it is essential to continue this discussion and to define the interventions to be implemented in the next budget law from a shared perspective.
26219	209	This year, the public finance performance is better than expected and allows us to intervene, as we have done so far, without new budget slippages.
26219	211	A substantial measure must be adopted by the first days of August to mitigate the impact on citizens and businesses of the increase in energy costs, and then strengthen purchasing power, especially of the weaker sections of the population.
26219	213	Reducing the tax burden on workers, starting with the lowest wages, is a medium-term goal.
26219	215	This is a point on which trade unions and entrepreneurs agree.
26219	217	With the last budget law we adopted a first and temporary intervention.
26219	219	We must add another one quickly, within the limits allowed by our financial resources.
26219	221	We also need to push the renewal of collective agreements.
26219	223	Many, including those in commerce and services, have expired for too many years.
26219	225	Collective bargaining is one of the strengths of our industrial model, due to the extent and quality of protection, but it does not yet reach all workers.
26219	227	At European level, a directive on the minimum wage is in the process of being definitively approved, and it is in this direction that we must move, together with the social partners, ensuring decent wage levels for the groups of workers most suffering.
26219	229	Citizenship income is an important measure to reduce poverty, but it can be improved to benefit those most in need and reduce negative effects on the labor market.
26219	231	There is a need for a pension reform that guarantees outgoing flexibility mechanisms and a sustainable system, anchored to the contribution system.
26219	233	Italy must continue to redesign its energy policy, as it has done in recent months.
26219	235	This week's Summit in Algiers confirms our absolute determination to diversify our suppliers, push hard on renewable energy.
26219	237	To do this, you need the necessary infrastructure.
26219	239	We need to speed up the installation of the regasification terminals – in Piombino and Ravenna.
26219	241	It is not possible to say that you want energy security for Italians and then, at the same time, protest against these infrastructures.
26219	243	These are safe systems, essential for our energy needs, for the maintenance of our productive fabric.
26219	245	In particular, we must complete the installation of the Piombino regasification terminal by next spring.
26219	247	It's a matter of national security.
26219	249	At the same time, we must continue the energy transition towards clean sources as a matter of urgency.
26219	251	By 2030 we need to install around 70 GW of renewable energy plants.
26219	253	The drought and anomalous heat waves that have hit Europe in recent weeks remind us of the urgency of tackling the climate crisis as a whole seriously.
26219	255	I am also thinking of the interventions to improve the management of water resources, the maintenance of which has often been seriously deficient.
26219	257	"The PNRR allocates more than 4 billion for these investments, which must be accompanied by a more urgent ""water plan""."
26219	259	As regards energy efficiency measures and more generally building bonuses, we intend to address the critical issues in the transfer of tax credits, but at the same time reduce the generosity of contributions.
26219	261	As promised in my inaugural speech, and supported by you in this hall, this government identifies itself fully with the European Union, with the transatlantic link.
26219	263	Our position is clear and strong: in the heart of the European Union, the G7, NATO.
26219	265	We must continue to support Ukraine in every way, as this Parliament has committed the Government to do with a parliamentary resolution.
26219	267	As President Zelensky repeated to me on the phone yesterday, arming Ukraine is the only way for the Ukrainians to defend themselves.
26219	269	At the same time, we must continue to strive to seek negotiated solutions, starting with the wheat crisis.
26219	271	And we must increase efforts to combat interference by Russia and other autocracies in our politics, in our society.
26219	273	Italy is a free and democratic country.
26219	275	We must respond with the strength of European values ​​to those who try to seduce us with their authoritarian model.
26219	277	The European Union is our home and within it we must carry on ambitious challenges.
26219	279	We must continue to fight to obtain a ceiling on the price of Russian gas, which would benefit everyone, and for the reform of the electricity market, which can begin with the domestic one even before European agreements are reached.
26219	281	These measures are essential to defend the purchasing power of families and to protect the production levels of businesses.
26219	283	In Europe, the reform of the budgetary and common defense rules and the overcoming of the unanimity principle will also soon be discussed.
26219	285	In all these fields, Italy has a lot to say – with credibility, a constructive spirit, and without any subordination.
26219	287	There are other commitments that the executive wants to make which concern, for example, the reform of the general practitioner system and the discussion for the recognition of forms of differentiated autonomy.
26219	289	But all of this requires a Government that is truly strong and cohesive and a Parliament that accompanies it with conviction, in mutual respect for roles.
26219	291	Italy does not need a facade of trust, which vanishes in the face of inconvenient measures.
26219	293	We need a new pact of trust, sincere and concrete, like the one that has allowed us up to now to change the country for the better.
26219	295	The parties and you parliamentarians - are you ready to rebuild this pact?
26219	297	Are you ready to confirm the effort you made in the first few months, and which then faded away?
26219	299	I am here, in this hall today, at this point in the discussion, only because the Italians have asked for it.
26219	301	You must not give this answer to these questions to me, but you must give it to all Italians.
26224	1	Draghi meets (only) his friend Letta. From pastrocchio to centre-left government?
26224	3	Rome, July 19 - Thus it was that Mario Draghi met Enrico Letta, a faithful companion in the adventures and (above all) misadventures of the government of the mediocre. He has met only him (for now), without annoying allies who question the alliance, just to evaluate what to do. Let's assume? A center-left government, with a few pieces of Forza Italia and no Lega.
26224	5	"Draghi meets (only) Letta. Lega and Forza Italia: ""Bewilderment"""
26224	7	"Possible? No numbers in hand, unless the pentastellato firmament is recomposed for this purpose. Contiani, Dimaiani, ex Contiani, various defectors, all inside the bandwagon. And who knows, even some centrist crutch that always pops up when necessary, to be fished a little from the Mixed Group, a little here, a little there, so much so that the new Christian Democrats dwell everywhere. And then come on, someone willing to keep the rickety shack standing and keep the armchair planted in it is always found. The fact is that at Lega and Forza Italia, today's lunch suddenly went sideways to the news of the conversation between Letta and the outgoing premier. ""At the beginning of the center-right government summit, bewilderment was expressed because President Mario Draghi received the secretary of the Democratic Party and not the leaders of the other majority parties, after, moreover, a political verification had been requested"", reveals the 'Ansa, citing sources from the centre-right government meeting in Villa Grande."
26224	9	Yes, because in Berlusconi's Roman residence, the Northern League, Forzisti and what remains of the UDC were discussing how to reiterate the veto to the Five Stars, when they suddenly found themselves with this not very welcome news. So now what does the Salvini-Cav pairing intend to do? Will he demand a candlelight meeting late in the evening, will he break the bank or will he wait silently until Draghi's speech scheduled for tomorrow morning? Certainly, regardless of the moves of the center-right and although the road to Draghi bis appears increasingly impervious, a way to fix the pieces can always be found in order to avoid elections.
26224	11	"In fact, among the main parties that make up Parliament (but not the majority), only the Brothers of Italy continues to clamor for a return to the polls. “According to the press, it seems that all of Italy is begging Draghi to stay, as if this government were in the hearts of all Italians. But then the same press warns that if there were votes, the opposition would win hands down. Typical cognitive dissonances of the left”, writes Giorgia Meloni on Twitter. ""That's why they are trying everything to avoid going back to the vote immediately..."", adds the leader of FdI on Facebook, publishing a recent survey by Swg which gives Fdi at 23.8%. Polls that speak volumes about the current appreciation of Italians for the forces that support Draghi."
26227	1	Not again! Biden Unveils Another $700 Million For Ukraine's Weapons!
26227	3	While promising not to send long-range missiles to Ukraine, President Biden has announced that he will send long-range missiles to Ukraine. He also unveiled another $700 million in arms for Ukraine (this part of the $40 billion… or is it already used up?). Even today: EUROPOL (finally) wakes up to the nightmare of billions of weapons flooding Europe from Ukraine.

2623	1	Soros calls for Putin's defeat
2623	3	Unless Russia is swiftly defeated in Ukraine, the collective West will not be able to tackle climate change in time to save civilization, billionaire financier George Soros said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also called Russia and China the biggest threats to his concept of an open society.
2623	5	"Russia's sending of troops to Ukraine ""may have been the start of World War III and our civilization may not survive,"" Soros told the WEF, and even when the fighting stops, ""the situation won't come back."" never again to the one before."""
2623	7	"In his account, the ""invasion"" occurred in the midst of a struggle between ""two systems of government diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society"", the former embodied by the West and the latter by Russia and China."
2623	9	"Soros, 91, recalled the ""exciting days"" of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when his wealth soared to the point where he could spend $300 million a year in 1987, and his foundations in Eastern Europe ""came proved more effective than I expected."""
2623	11	The Hungarian financier failed to mention the collapse in living standards that followed for ordinary citizens.
2623	13	"He said the tide began to turn after the 2001 September 11 attacks, ""repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege"", with China and Russia posing ""the biggest threat""."
2623	15	"However, Soros was optimistic about how that fight would go. According to him, Russian troops should be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators and emerge victorious within days or weeks, but Ukraine was able to ""defeat"" them with the help of the United States and NATO. Meanwhile, he said Chinese leader Xi Jinping damaged his legitimacy with the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai and elsewhere."
2623	17	What really worried Soros, however, was that the conflict in Ukraine interfered with the environmental agenda, meaning that climate change could become irreversible.
2623	19	"The best and perhaps the only way to preserve our civilization is to defeat Putin as soon as possible, he added. ""It could be the end of our civilization,"" he said, insisting that ""we must mobilize all our resources to end soon to war""."
2623	21	"Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Monday urged the WEF to broker a peace in Ukraine in the next two months before Russia is thrust into ""a permanent alliance with China"" that would destabilize Europe."
2623	23	"Russia has been an essential part of Europe for 400 years, noted the 98-year-old Kissinger, warning those seeking Moscow's ""defeat""."
26230	1	Zelensky: Let's prepare a million-strong army •
26230	3	Ukraine is assembling a million fighting forces equipped with Western weapons to recover the southern territories occupied by Russia. This was announced by Kiev Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in an interview with the Sunday Times. Claiming for the President Volodymyr Zelensky gave orders to develop plans for the liberation of coastal areas, which are considered vital for the country. “We understand that it is politically necessary. The president has instructed the high command to develop the plans, and the general staff will communicate what is needed,” Reznikov explained.
26230	5	Zelensky: Russians responsible for Donetsk attack will be punished
26230	7	"“A rocket attack on the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. All those who give orders for such raids, all those who carry them out targeting our cities, residential areas, kill absolutely deliberately. After such attacks, they will not be able to say that they did not know or did not understand. Retribution is inevitable for every Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone."" This was stated by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a video message on social media."
26231	1	Landings and infections: the scourge of illegal immigrants enters the new Covid emergency
26231	3	Taranto, 13 July - The arrival at the port of Taranto of the Geo Barents, a ship of the NGO Doctors Without Borders with 314 illegal immigrants on board, is scheduled for today. The announcement from the Italian authorities came after midnight yesterday as the boat was going back and forth in front of the Sicilian coast of Agrigento. The number of landings is increasing exponentially, and is ready to set new records, in the face of an absolutely helpless political class; ministers and ministries reduced to simple traffic dispatchers. You go here, you go there, and so on.
26231	5	That naval traffic that the NGOs themselves have fueled to excess, allowing the traffickers to increase their earnings – and those of those who then manage hospitalization and maintenance. We have spoken over and over again of the figures that revolve around the hospitality business, which it would be better to call the new slave trade, also in the context of all those projects, lavishly financed
26231	7	for integration. Operation, the latter, which appears at least unlikely. Just read the crime news of any newspaper from any part of Italy to understand it.
26231	9	Immigration at the time of the crisis and Covid
26231	11	Now the question arises spontaneously: but in an international context in which the energy crisis, the balance between super powers, the rigor that Draghi is ready to offer the nation to save on gas, electricity and water (due to another emergency, that of drought) how can Italy continue to take on hundreds of thousands of immigrants?
26231	13	"And to stay on the subject of an emergency, the umpteenth complaint about the management of illegal immigration at the time of Covid arrives from Trapani. The Trapani provincial secretariat of the union organization of the State Police ""Italia Celere"" yesterday issued a press release in which the inadequacy of the ""reception system"" is clearly written. Linked, above all, to the pandemic and the lack of concrete answers for the health security of police operators, civilians operating within the C.P.R. (Centri di Permanenza per i repatrii), despite the fact that reminders have been sent for a year."
26231	15	"“In recent weeks there have been transfers from Pantelleria to Trapani of subjects landed irregularly on the island, including many in a “self-surveillance regime” as they are “close contacts” of subjects who tested positive for Covid upon disembarkation. In particular, of all the transferees, 7 who were in the aforementioned condition, with self-surveillance expiring on 14 July 2022, were held at the C.P.R. Milo pending execution of the refoulement/expulsion order issued against them""."
26231	17	With the Covid landings in freedom
26231	19	"The press release continues: “The foreigner, F.M. of 49 years, landed in Pantelleria on 04 July, however, already subjected to the act of disembarkation with a quick swab for which he had tested negative, accused last Sunday of a feverish state, following which he was taken to the Emergency Room of the 'Sant'Antonio Abate Hospital in Trapani, where he tested positive for COVID-19. So far so good could be said, given that the 7 subjects were, and are, within a separate sector of the C.P.R., specifically set up to prevent potentially infected subjects from coming into contact with other foreigners already detained at the C.P.R. Of all the foreigners transferred in recent weeks, the number of subjects subjected to the Self-Surveillance regime is very high and the number of foreigners who, after having received notification of a Rejection Provision, having been unable to detain them at a C.P.R. national territory due to unavailability of places, they were recipients of an order from the Quaestor to leave the national territory within 7 days""."
26231	21	"And we could stop here already! But the press release goes further: “This O.S. fears the emergence of COVID outbreaks within the structures for 'asilants' and has strong doubts that the irregular recipients of the Order of the Quaestor, free to roam around Italy, observe the requirements to wear an FFP2 mask, indoors or in presence of gatherings, up to the tenth day following the date of the last close contact. In practice, thanks to the incorrect management of transfers from Pantelleria, potential triggered biological weapons have been put into circulation on the national territory, which we do not know where they will cause damage. It is evident to this Secretariat that something is not working in the methodology used in the management of illegal immigrants who arrive on our coasts, which transforms these subjects into time bombs for the health of the operators of the FF.PP., for the operators of the managing body of the C.P.R. , for foreigners themselves and for any citizen who, unaware, comes into contact with them""."
26231	23	"The trade union organization concludes: «Our O.S., however much it tries to be conciliatory and however much it tries to find a dialogue with the relevant institutions, cannot compromise on the protection of the health of men in uniform and this should also be a fundamental interest of the Prefecture and Police Headquarters. Our O.S. will pay close attention to the decisions taken in relation to the above, because hospitality cannot, nor should it, be an absolute priority over public health and the health of workers. The responsibility for certain erroneous choices weighs heavily on the lives of police officers and their families""."
26231	25	Italians in quarantine, free immigrants
26231	27	Did you all understand? Businesses, workers, the elderly, children all subjected to bans and restrictions for two and a half years and with the threat of starting again in September while there are those who roam free and without any obligation in our own cities. In order not to open another chapter: where does the data on positive, ill and dead from Covid of illegal immigrants who arrived in Italy end up? What statistics are they referring to? We posed the question to many Organizations and Authorities, but no answer... Who is hiding, and why?
26232	1	Meloni, Giuliani (former mayor of New York): she will be the Italian Margaret Thatcher.
26232	3	Rudolph - Rudy - Giuliani, former Republican mayor of New York, lawyer and conservative politician does not spare himself and demolishes the house of cards built on the Draghi government, explaining how the media which are intervening in these hours to discredit the party of patriots and conservatives of FdI, are only political instruments of censorship; other than authoritative media.
26232	5	"Giorgia Meloni will be the Italian Margaret Thatcher. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is convinced of this. The conservative politician, famous for having implemented the doctrine of ""zero tolerance"" against crime in the Big Apple, interviewed the other day in a podcast on the Rumble platform, said he had no doubts."
26232	7	Meloni will have to seize the opportunity lost by Silvio Berlusconi and give Italy a government that puts an end to socialist methods and creates a free market economy in Italy capable of dragging it out of the swamp of crisis.
26232	9	And with regard to the economic crisis, Giuliani has not spared harsh criticism of that Mario Draghi who continues to be presented by the mainstream as the Lord's anointed. He is part of that club that ruined Europe says Giuliani.
26232	11	“The fact – he said is that Draghi was a failure, yes, he got a big bailout from the EU but in exchange for very severe economic reforms that he had to carry out in Italy.
26232	12	Well, those economic reforms have not been implemented and the Italian economy is among the worst of the European countries, in fact the concern is that it could drag the EU economy down.
26232	13	So I don't understand how Draghi can be considered a success, I mean he is a success like Biden is a success, in the minds of the European left. He belongs to that club, he is part of that club, and they ruined… that club ruined the economy of Europe, and Italy is one of the main victims.”
26232	14	And again Giuliani attacked the New York Times and those media that have started again – after the fall of the Draghi government – ​​to launch phantom accusations of fascism against the Brothers of Italy and Giorgia Meloni herself.
26232	15	"“Well, they, the way they cover the news dishonestly and hide things, they constantly violate the first amendment (US Constitution – freedom of speech ed.), this makes them more fascist than anyone they are writing, so I don't consider them serious at all, where they censored the hard drive news (by Hunter Biden ed) for 18 months and then, finally admitted it was true. I mean, is this really a newspaper? Or is it a fascist political movement that likes to trample on people's right of expression? Giorgia Meloni is what Italy needs and furthermore she is someone who believes in the free enterprise system that needs to be safeguarded in Italy, you know it is on the verge of collapse if it hasn't collapsed already …""."
26236	1	Malta rejects French NGO in Italian port: another 314 freeloaders on the way
26236	3	Foreign NGOs continue to attack Italy. Malta, when called into question, rejects them in Italy. And they stand in front of our ports.
26236	5	Since the start of the year:
26236	7	Foreign NGOs have dumped 10,500 illegal immigrants in Italy since the beginning of the year
26236	9	The costs should be passed on to the flag governments. And above all, the fucking illegal immigrants.
26236	11	"The NGOs pressing on our country with the latest claim to a safe haven, are launching yet another ultimatum off our coasts. Yesterday was the Ocean Viking, which on Wednesday brought 306 passengers on board to Pozzallo. Today it is the Geo Barents of Doctors Without Borders, which has already positioned itself about 14 miles from the limit of the Italian territorial waters near Augusta: one of the most popular ports of call and among the most generously donated as pos. And the one again claimed with a vehement protest that reads: ""A positive answer must be given now"", thundered by the NGO. In short, the complicated redistribution of the 2,000 migrants from Lampedusa to the other reception centers in our country does not stop traffickers and humanitarian organizations who, undaunted, continue to en route to our borders. To guard our coasts. And to demand one of our ports."
26236	13	Migrants, with our coasts collapsing, Geo Barents is pressing for the disembarkation of the 314 on board
26236	15	"While Malta, France, and in this case Norway – Geo Barents, specifically, flies the Norwegian flag – shrug. Knowing full well that the problem will fall upon us once again. Strengthened by the alibi, now tested, according to which Italy should ""only"" play the role of bridge country. Safe landing place, where migrants land and undergo medical triage, before being (possibly) transferred to Norway. Where, however, coincidentally, they never arrive. And where the 314 on board the Médecins Sans Frontières ship will not arrive this time either, after our authorities - who will have taken charge of them - will distribute them in the various reception centers of the Belpaese. With the Interior Ministry which, more usually, is silent and consents."
26236	17	In short, it is obvious that even for the 314 on board the Geo Barents the port of disembarkation will be an Italian port. Discounted. Implicit in the request that forces the tones. This story too, like all those that have preceded it to date, is the chronicle of an announced landing that recites the same script as always. So much so that by now the NGOs, as Il Giornale also underlines in these hours, «do not turn to other countries to request disembarkation, despite the fact that there are many bordering on the Mediterranean basin. Or rather - continues the Milanese newspaper - Geo Barents has made the request to Malta, knowing full well that the authorities of the island country will never respond to the request. So much so that it has decided to start pressing against the Italian borders, even if it is flying a foreign flag.
26245	1	Orban, 'EU changes strategy, West negotiates between Moscow and Kiev'
26245	3	"BRUSSELS - Hungarian premier Viktor Orban is once again speaking of the war in Ukraine and attacking the strategy implemented so far by Brussels. ""A new strategy is needed that does not focus on winning the war but on an adequate peace offer,"" Orban stressed according to his spokesman on twitter. The task of the West - he added - is not to side with someone, but to stand between the Russians and the Ukrainians: ""there will be no peace until there is a peace negotiation between Russia and the United States"". |"
26245	5	"The head of the Hungarian government spoke at the Tusványos Summer, in Romania. ""Europe should not aspire to a role in world politics until it is able to address foreign policy issues 'in its own backyard', Orban attacked, adding: 'the West is losing the battle over natural resources and raw materials prime"" and international politics is destroying the Russian-German energy axis"". ""Today - he pressed - the situation is that the Russians sell less energy but have much more income"", while ""the EU is losing because its energy deficit has tripled"". Then dwelling on the national challenges, the prime minister reiterated some of the key points that have been dividing Budapest from Brussels for months. “If we stay out of war, migration, gender madness, global minimum tax and economic downturn, Hungary will be able to maintain its success,” Orban explained"
26249	1	Ukrainian ports are back to work. Moscow: 'Russian exports restart'
26249	3	"Ukrainian ports ""go back to work"". This was stated by the Ukrainian Navy on the day when the center for the coordination of operations opens in Istanbul to allow the safe passage of Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea after the agreement between Kiev, Moscow and the UN with the mediation of Turkey. And this as Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko says the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukrainian grain exports to the Black Sea could come to naught ""if obstacles to Russia's agricultural exports are not promptly removed."" Interfax reports it. Rudenko says grain shipments from Ukraine will begin soon and hopes the deal will stand."
26249	5	"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in the evening: he will present a ""concrete proposal"" for the release of basketball champion Brittney Griner, detained in Russia since February, to Russian Foreign Minister Serghiei Lavrov in a phone call in the coming days. Blinken didn't go into detail ""for security reasons."" It is a ""substantial"" proposal, Blinken reiterated. It is probably a prisoner exchange as happened for the ex marine Trevor Reed."
26249	7	Meanwhile, after 62 years of operations in the country, Tetra Pak is leaving Russia and selling the production to a local reseller. According to the multinational that produces integrated systems for the treatment and packaging of food, it was the economic sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia, after the invasion of Ukraine, that made trade with Moscow impossible. “The cumulative effect of export restrictions to Russia has led to an unsustainable supply chain, leaving the company with no alternative but to leave the country,” writes Tetra Pak. The company was founded in Lund, a city in southern Sweden, in 1951 and today has a global market, among the leading companies in the food packaging sector. The TT agency reports that its operations in Russia last year registered a value of 430 million euros.
26249	9	In Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appoints Andriy Kostin, a lawmaker from his own party, as the country's next attorney general. This was reported by the Ukrinform agency. Zelensky presents a formal request to Parliament for the assembly to vote to confirm the appointment of Kostin who will replace Iryna Venediktova, who was ousted as attorney general earlier this month.
26249	11	"Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to Zelensky, claims responsibility for the attack on the main bridge of Kherson on twitter and calls on the Russians to leave the occupied city on which the Ukrainians have launched a counter-offensive. “Antonivsky bridge can be called an air defense device that intercepts all Ukrainian missiles, but there is no escaping reality: the occupiers should learn to swim across the Dnipro River. Or they should leave Kherson while it is still possible. There may not be a third caveat,"" he explains. Then Zelensky adds: 'Day after day, our defenders effectively strike enemy positions upsetting the plans of the occupiers. Himars and other precision weapons are turning the tide of war in our favor. And although the firepower of the Ukrainian army is inferior to that of the enemy, our warriors still strike with greater skill and precision' thanks to US-made missiles."
26249	13	"In fact, the fighting does not subside. Six people were injured in a Russian S-300 missile attack in Kharkiv this morning, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a Telegram post, Ukrinform reports. According to Terekhov, Novobavarskyi district also suffered an offensive: ""Fortunately, there were no casualties and there was no fire."" On the night of July 26, Russian troops shelled an area near the center of Kharkiv, Ukrainians say. ."
26251	1	"Russian gas, von der Leyen: ""EU prepare for new cuts"""
26251	3	"The announcement of the president of the European Commission: ""Emergency plan by mid-July"""
26251	5	"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calls on the EU to prepare for the eventuality that Russia ""completely"" cuts gas supplies. ""We must prepare for further problems in gas supplies, even for a complete cut by Russia - he said speaking in the plenary of the European Parliament in Strasbourg - overall today 12 member countries are directly affected by a total or partial reduction in deliveries of gas""."
26251	7	It is obvious: Vladimir Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. This is why the Commission is working on an emergency plan: we will present this plan and the necessary tools by mid-July. Member States have their national emergency plans already in place. This is good, but we need European coordination and joint action. We have to make sure that, in the event of major difficulties, the gas flows to where it is needed most. We must provide European solidarity. And we need to protect the single market and industrial value chains, he said.
26251	9	"Natural gas stocks in the EU ""were at 55% a week ago and now we should be above"" that threshold. The G7 has decided to work internationally to arrive at a ""potential mechanism"" that imposes a ceiling on the price of Russian oil. It will take ""a global approach, an alliance of many countries willing to put a ceiling on the price of Russian oil and it will be necessary to convince many countries that do not want to join the alliance so that they do not go around"" the ceiling."
26251	11	"This potential oil price cap could also be a good platform if we were to look at a gas price cap under special circumstances. ""We could activate, if needed, mechanisms such as a Sure plan"" of loans to finance the expenses necessary to face the energy crisis, but ""it is not part of the emergency plan"" that the Commission will present by mid-July."
26251	13	The president of the European Commission then compared the resistance of the Ukrainians to the Russian invasion to that of the Czechoslovakians against the Russian tanks sent, in August 1968, to repress the experiment of 'socialism with a human face' by the secretary of the Communist Party Czechoslovakian Alexander Dubcek.
26251	15	"The Ukrainians - said von der Leyen speaking in the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on the occasion of the launch of the Czech presidency of the EU Council - faced the Russian invasion without weapons. Citizens spoke to Russian soldiers, wrote to them, evoked the absurdity of this war in all public spheres. These are images that remind us of another invasion, another phase of opposition. It was in Prague in 1968: you will remember the demonstrations by Czechs, young and old, who opposed the Russian invasion in the streets of Prague. Therefore, ""I cannot imagine a better country than the Czech Republic to take over the presidency of the EU Council. We are in a fight for freedom, peace and self-determination"", he concludes."
26253	1	Turkish Defense Minister: Russia has nothing to do with the bombing of Odessa
26253	3	Kosovo postpones for a month the ban on the use of Serbian license plates and documents that led to the current escalation
26253	5	Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has issued some statements on the explosions in the city of Odessa, which the Kiev regime attributes to a missile attack by Russia.
26253	7	"In a statement collected by the correspondent of the Anadolu agency, Akar said that there was an explosion in Odessa this morning and in this regard he said: ""We received information that there had been a missile attack and on this we had a Telephone conversation with Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov and Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Aleksandr Kubrakov. We received the necessary information. They said that there had been a missile attack. They said that one of the missile attacks hit one of the silos, l 'other fell in an area near the silo, but the important thing is that there is no negativity in the loading capacity and capacity of the docks, and that activities in Odessa can continue""."
26253	9	"Then the Turkish minister reported that he got in touch with Russia: “Furthermore, in our contact with Russia, the Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and were looking into the matter very closely. and in detail. The fact that such an incident occurred immediately after the agreement we made yesterday regarding the shipment of grain really concerned us. However, we continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the agreement we reached yesterday and we have also expressed in our meetings that we are available to the parties to continue their cooperation calmly and patiently."""
26253	11	"Akar further added that the agreement will be implemented as soon as possible: “Already with the start of these talks, there has been a drop in prices as stated by the experts, that this should be continued and that it is very important in terms of humanity, in terms of meeting food needs, in terms of rescuing people waiting for grain. Our coordination with Ukraine will continue. We have fulfilled and will continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the memorandum of understanding we signed during yesterday's meeting. In this framework, we have multiplied our efforts since yesterday for the functioning of the Joint Coordination Center, as enshrined in the agreement. Including the UN representative, the representatives of Russia and Ukraine have now started working together with Turkey on joint coordination. It is our hope and wish that these and similar events are set aside quickly and these studies completed as soon as possible in line with the agreement we have reached. At present, we are following the incident closely and maintaining our contacts. It is our hope and wish that these works will continue as desired, as indicated in the agreement""."
26260	1	FOLLOWING PUTIN IS LEADING ORBAN TO THE ABYSS – ANGRY PROTEST AGAINST THE TAX REFORM IMPOSED BY ORBAN HAS BEEN GOING ON IN BUDAPEST FOR FIVE DAYS – SINCE HIS FOURTH RE-ELECTION, IT IS THE FIRST TIME THE HUNGARIAN PREMIER HAD TO FACE MASS PROTESTS – THE COST OF HIM DEARLY IS THE PRO-PUTIN LINE ON GAS AND OIL: THE ENERGY CRISIS HAS NOW FORCED HIM TO ELIMINATE SUBSIDIES FOR PROTECTED CATEGORIES. MEANWHILE INFLATION IS AT THE STARS…
26260	3	The first protests began last Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered on a bridge over the Danube, overlooked by the Országház, the sumptuous Gothic Parliament building. Protesters then blocked traffic in central Budapest for three hours. Yesterday, however, a few thousand Hungarians demonstrated against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the fifth consecutive day of protests.
26260	5	To bring the Magyars on the streets is a new law desired by the nationalist and conservative prime minister. The measure is intended to increase the tax burden for hundreds of thousands of traders and self-employed workers, say protesters who raised placards and shouted heavy slogans at the head of government.
26260	7	The protests mark an unexpected drop in popularity for Orbán, whose Hungarian Civic Union (Fidesz) won the legislative elections last April by a large margin. Many, especially in Europe, had hoped for the victory of Orbán's challenger, that Peter Marki-Zay who today is trying to ride the protests, taking the lead of a heterogeneous coalition of centrists, social democrats, ecologists and former right-wing extremists.
26260	9	Three months ago, however, the premier in power without interruption since 2010 was confirmed with a large 52% of the votes. Orbán had conducted yet another electoral campaign breaking with the European Union, demonstrating the unwillingness of a Hungary dependent on Russian hydrocarbons to break with Vladimir Putin's Russia.
26260	11	"Curiously, his government is now facing the strongest wave of protests precisely because of energy: the parliament controlled by Fidesz has made a clean sweep of the protected categories by establishing that those who consume more energy than the average will have to pay it at the market price and no longer on the basis state-subsidized rates. The intervention of the prime minister on Friday on the radio who defended the law as ""good and necessary"" was of little use."
26260	13	"Two days earlier the government had declared a ""state of energy emergency"", announcing greater use of coal and inviting families to moderate consumption. In late May, Orbán also blocked the EU's plans for a total and immediate embargo against Russian oil."
26260	15	However, the counter-current attitude of Budapest did not prevent a strong weakening of the forint on the eve of the conflict 367 were needed to buy one euro, today it takes 410. Associated with the increase in gas and oil on the global market, the decline in the national currency it has plunged Hungary into an inflationary crisis that is costing Orbán much popularity.
26260	17	According to the Központi Statisztikai Hivatal (the national statistical body), the inflation rate in Hungary rose to 11.7% annually in June, up sharply from 10.7% in May and 9.5% of April. In late January, the Hungarian government had imposed a ceiling on the prices of six food products (granulated sugar, wheat flour, sunflower oil, pork, chicken breast and milk) between February 1 and May 1, 2022.
26260	19	Announced by Orbán himself, the measure helped the premier win the elections.
26260	21	Surviving the economic shocks of a very close war Hungary and Ukraine are neighboring countries is a new challenge.
26261	1	The next alarms: hot autumn? Not very cold
26261	3	Warm autumn, or rather, very cold. In Italy the siren of various alarms rings out, which would seem distant and microscopic, but in reality they are concrete. Let's see them in detail to understand what is happening and to prevent them from continuing into the next season, otherwise let's get ready for a very cold, dark and expensive autumn.
26261	5	The most recent problem is represented by the government crisis.
26261	7	The 5 Star Movement did not vote to trust the government in the Aid Decree, which was nonetheless approved. Draghi then presented himself to the Council of Ministers, declaring his resignation, which was rejected by Mattarella.
26261	9	Two scenarios would be envisaged: if Draghi decided to leave his office, there would be a vote. A plausible but undesirable hypothesis, given that measures such as: cutting the price of petrol, bonuses for workers, PNRR objectives and others would follow.
26261	11	The other scenario would be to move forward, but without the 5 Stars. This would continue until the natural end of the legislature, 2023, so that the government will be able to continue working on the dossiers at risk.
26261	13	All of this is happening at a very difficult time: war on Europe's doorstep, skyrocketing inflation, for which an irresponsible and inappropriate attitude given the numerous and different crises afflicting Italy today.
26261	15	The energy crisis, driven by the sharp increase in gas costs, is above all caused by the war in Ukraine and the reduction in supplies from Moscow.
26261	17	The public transport sector would be severely affected, despite having an eye to the future. To support the sector, a funding plan was approved, deriving from the PNRR and national funds, up to 2033. The Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Giovannini, reiterated that investments for the future must focus on technological and digital innovation and environmental, social and economic sustainability, to succeed in the leap in quality.
26261	19	Moreover, it is also health care that is in pieces.
26261	21	"Italian hospitals would appear to be an emergency within an emergency due to various critical issues: lack of hospital staff, lack of beds, organizational difficulties, lack of funding. In addition, despite the Covid, in the emergency room for a simple ankle sprain the average waiting time is long, perhaps the name ""slow aid"" would be more appropriate. What is certain is that the pandemic has shown the weakness of the health sector and the current emergency room crisis is nothing more than the result and tip of the iceberg of a hospital system in trouble."
26261	23	A further national alarm is represented by the increase in torrid heat and the absence of rain, in fact after the drought there is a fire emergency.
26261	25	Italy burns with fires tripled in the past year compared to the historical average, more than one fire every two days since the beginning of 2022, in a summer that comes after a spring ranked as the sixth hottest ever on the planet. In these cases, prevention is a priority, as is the need to team up with the civil protection, with the municipalities and with the firefighters, who during the summer period intensify their shifts to promptly deal with this emergency.
26261	27	However, a decidedly hot summer is not expected just for the temperatures, but also for the prices of electricity and gas.
26261	29	The dramatic increase in electricity and natural gas tariffs is certainly not accidental, as it is mainly due to Russia's decisions to partially cut supplies to Germany and Italy. Consequently, it appears increasingly important and crucial that the affected countries find alternative sources from which to obtain supplies.
26261	31	Furthermore, the times in which the Draghi government had to take measures to limit the impact of the bills are numerous. For example, in the Dear Energy Decree of the end of June, the zeroing of system charges was confirmed for the third quarter of the current year, affected precisely by these new increases. Then the 200 euro bonus, to help employees, retirees and the unemployed. But the question is: will it be enough?
26261	33	Therefore, the economic framework - and not only that - of our country depends heavily on the evolution of the war in Ukraine.
26261	35	"The war would therefore be ""the great judge"" of the Italian situation."
26263	1	"Rome burns and the ""rubbish"" is rampant? Here is the showcase of Italy"
26263	3	Rome capital city? Yes, but of the Italian paradoxes. What is happening these days in the Eternal City is basically nothing exceptional: it is the faithful mirror of a country adrift. A country that suffocates from its ills that have never been cured and from the invincible compulsion to repeat the same mistakes.
26263	5	"The country suffocates in debt, just as Rome suffocates in the ""rubbish"" and in the smoke produced by the fires in the junkyards in the eastern quadrant of the city, fires set in all probability by organized crime. And yes, because the ""rubbish"" has always attracted various mafias, criminals and marauders. The suspicion of many is that the fires flare up just as there is talk of a waste-to-energy plant in the capital. As if to say: bosses and sub-bosses also intend to enter the business that is emerging. And they launch signals… incendiary."
26263	7	A perfect synchronism. As in the mysterious fire in the Malagrotta mega-landfill, which caused yet another waste emergency and for some time produced an even more mysterious disease among hundreds of operators of the AMA (the Rome waste disposal company) who marked visit. To then heal mysteriously, all together, in one night. And then they say that miracles don't exist.
26263	9	But what are Roman citizens ultimately complaining about? What is happening to them is ordinary “Italian” sadness. If the citizens of East Rome risk dioxin, what should the inhabitants of the area between Naples and Caserta say, where the soil is poisoned by highly toxic waste buried by the Camorra?
26263	11	"Italian evils, Roman evils. If Italy is in debt, Rome has long since sunk into ""buffi"" (as in Roman dialect debts are defined). After all, how do you maintain the large army of municipal employees? They are the beauty of 48,000, as much as a small Italian city. And let's not consider the immense army of workers in subcontracted services. A mass that grew, council after council, in the race for municipal benefits."
26263	13	Italian style, tremendously Italian. Like the habit of putting off problems instead of facing and solving them. It is not so much a matter of indolence as of the chronic incapacity of decision-makers to decide, squeezed as they are between clientele, power lobbies, ideological pressure groups.
26263	15	"Because, in the end, it is precisely these champions of particularism that the Romans have to thank for the rampant ""rubbish"" and the fires of the junkyards. Ideologism and bureaucratic obtuseness did not allow the problem of waste disposal to be resolved in the capital at the time of mayor Raggi, who aimed at separate collection instead of thinking about the waste-to-energy plant, which was, the latter, an effective solution, but not ecologically correct. And his contribution to the mess was also given by Nicola Zingaretti, who as president of the Lazio Region agreed with the mayor Virginia, approving a plan that did not include the waste incineration plant. Ecologists must be satisfied, because they constitute a pool of left-wing votes. Or not?"
26263	17	Waste sorting was a total failure. On the other hand, the ecologists-animalists have had their satisfaction, given that whole families of wild boars feast around the piles of garbage. Today Zingaretti is silent, because the mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri has in fact disavowed him, betting decisively on the waste-to-energy plant. A divergence in the Pd house, which demonstrates the lack of lucidity of the Roman political ruling class.
26263	19	"Now Gualtieri and all of Rome's political nomenklatura await the constitutional law which grants special powers, including regulatory autonomy, to the capital. They await her as sorcerer's apprentices await the magic wand. But we already know how it will end: the special powers will only serve to further squeeze the Roman taxpayers, who already pay the highest local taxes in Italy, only to find themselves then the ""rubbish"" on the streets and buses that occasionally go to fire."
26263	21	All in line with the Italian style, tremendously Italian.
26264	1	Iran nuclear talks fail: is another war on the horizon?
26264	3	Iran has been at the center of the international agenda for a few days.
26264	5	"The Tehran summit between Iranian President Raissi, Russian President Putin and Turkish President Erdogan on Syria, the war in Ukraine and more has just concluded. But the most burning issue concerns the now almost obvious failure of the negotiations for the restoration of the JCPOA, otherwise known as the ""Iranian nuclear agreement""."
26264	7	The agreement called for Iran to eliminate its medium-enriched uranium reserves, cut its low-enriched uranium reserves by 98% and reduce its gas-fired centrifuges by two-thirds for thirteen years, while for the next fifteen years the enrichment of uranium could not exceed 3.67%, in order to prevent Iran from acquiring atomic weapons.
26264	9	The agreement was signed by Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany in July 2015. The agreement was fiercely criticized by Israel and the US Jewish communities. Donald Trump, who succeeded Barack Obama as US president, then decreed the US exit from the agreement, restoring sanctions on Iran.
26264	11	Biden instead resumed negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Why did he do it? Simply because an Iran equipped with atomic weapons terribly scares not only Israel, but also the other Arab countries, allies of the USA.
26264	13	But the negotiations to restore the agreement immediately ended up on a dead end. The US would like to forever prevent Iran from possessing nuclear technology that would allow it to make an atomic bomb; at the same time they do not want to lift the sanctions on the country of the Ayatollahs. Without US sanctions, Iran would become a great power. On the other hand, the Iranian delegation was adamant on this position: first the US must eliminate the sanctions and then Iran will return to observe the provisions of the JCPOA, relating to uranium enrichment. None of the two sides, however, seems to withdraw from their positions.
26264	15	Therefore, given the now almost certain failure of the negotiations, Joe Biden has declared that he will prevent Iran from manufacturing an atomic bomb at all costs, even with war if necessary.
26264	17	Is the hypothesis of a US-Iran war realistic at this point? In such a conflict, if Russia and China do not intervene, the superiority of the US military over the Iranian one will be overwhelming. But Iran, with its recent missile advances, could raze Israel and US bases in the Middle East. This is well before the stars and stripes army can deploy a credible military force on the ground. Are the US willing to pay such a price?
26265	1	Strategika - The Beginning of the End for the Ukrainian Army?
26265	3	A certain warmongering and pro-NATO narrative insists in the mainstream media on Russia's possible defeat on the ground, as well as phantom counterattacks by Ukrainian forces.
26265	5	A functional narrative to continue sending weapons to the Kiev regime, despite the fact that these weapons will only have the effect of producing more destruction and unnecessary deaths, whether they are destroyed and captured by Russian forces or sold under the table by the Ukrainians themselves.
26265	7	Meanwhile, while the United States and Europe continue to chatter about a possible victory on the field, news of a very different tenor is coming from the battlefield.
26265	9	The French publication Strategika writes:
26265	11	"The beginning of the end for the Ukrainian military?
26265 13 After the double defeat in the Lysychansk - Severodonetsk sector and the loss of more than 10,000 men (killed, wounded, prisoners, missing) and the abandonment of 700 materials and heavy combat equipment, the bad news keeps piling up for the Kiev army with the continuation of the Russian and Allied offensive in the Donbass.
26265 15 Today we learn that in the Soledar sector, following the Russian air attacks, the 24th Mechanized Brigade amounts to 2,500 men, equal to 60% of the initial force committed. The 79th Airborne Assault Brigade saw its losses exceed 80% of its initial strength. Either way, these two brigades are no longer fit to fight as a formed unit.
26265 17 ...All these elements make it possible to consider the possibility of a collapse of the Ukrainian army in the Donbass in the next fifteen days. The blows inflicted by the Russians and their allies, less than 48 hours after the fall of Lysychansk, have left no respite for the fleeing units to gather their fugitives and rediscover a semblance of cohesion on their new lines of defense which, moreover, could now be taken in the rear in case of victory at Seversk and Krasnopolye in the Slaviansk sector."
26265	19	Russia continues to advance. Slowly but surely. Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) forces and Russian troops have entered the city of Seversk, which is under their operational control, TASS news agency said, citing a source close to the Lugansk People's Militia.
26265	21	"Allied forces have already entered Seversk (city in Donetsk People's Republic controlled by the Ukrainian army). I can tell that the city is under our operational control. Mopping-up operations are underway. Seversk will soon be completely liberated by Ukrainian troops.""
26265 23 The taking of Serversk was later confirmed by Vitaly Kiselev, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the LPR.
26265 25 Seversk is under our control, ”he told Channel One."
26265	27	The situation on the ground is increasingly difficult for Ukraine but the Kiev regime persists in not wanting to start any negotiations.
26265	29	"According to the spokeswoman of the Moscow Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, ""this is not the position of the Ukrainian state, but a song sung by Washington, which the Kiev regime has agreed to perform."""
26284	1	The Left of Terror: the race of alarmist headlines against the right to instill fear in voters
26284	3	For years they have accused Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of riding the fears of the Italians. Were they asking for more security? “You don't do politics on fear,” they objected. Were they asking for more immigration controls? “One does not speculate on the fear of being different”, they replied.
26284	5	Yet now, looking at certain headlines, seeing certain expressions on TV, reading certain editorials and certain services, it seems that the progressive front is united by a single goal: to use the language of fear to alarm voters, to give them the feeling that the apocalypse is near, that catastrophe is around the corner. All immersed in a single terrifying color: black.
26284	7	"Repubblica evokes ""the phalanx"", the Spanish fascist party"
26284	9	"Let's see some examples. Republic, more usually, stands out. It opens with a photo of Giorgia Meloni at the recent programmatic conference in Milan and with the title: La falange (name of the Spanish fascist party). But that's not enough. It is joined by a commentary by Furio Colombo entitled ""Promises from a black face"". An article that closes under the banner of boundless pessimism: ""It's not a good moment in Italian history"". Then Berizzi spreads about Giorgia Meloni's allies in Europe and the way Steve Bannon labeled her: ""Fascist post-fascist"". And yet there is an investigation into the ""black fiefdom"" of Latina which would be the model to which FdI looks. Here, Repubblica points out, Meloni chose his constituency ""armored by an ideological loyalty that has never been broken since December 18, 1932, when Benito Mussolini announced the birth of Littoria""."
26284	11	"""Tomorrow"" warns of Giorgia's ""march""."
26284	13	"De Benedetti's newspaper, Domani, summarizes the success of the Meloni line at the top of the center-right as follows: ""The march on Palazzo Chigi"". Where the term march is connotative and denotative. That's all. And I spig everything from the perspective of the demonizing narrative that the left is using. Then there are two pages on Guido Crosetto's “all affairs”. ""Felissimo"" by Giorgia - notes the newspaper - and that he could be chosen as prime minister of mediation. So he presents himself as shady and ambiguous because he cannot be called a ""fascist""..."
26284	15	Paul Krugman's grim predictions
26284	17	"Finally, in La Stampa we find the editorial by the economist Paul Krugman who prophesies gloomy crisis scenarios for Italy which risks sinking due to the rise of the ""anti-democratic forces"". And thank goodness that a few pages earlier Marcello Sorgi had warned: “Although Meloni is already targeted by journalistic revelations about her post-fascist past, it does not seem that they will be able to stop her progress. Indeed, among communication experts, there are those who say that they could favor it, mobilizing in their closest electorate the reaction to a sort of sense of persecution"". A warning so far not picked up on the left…"
26285	1	The UN asks Kiev, Moscow, the US and the EU to respect the agreements on Russian and Ukrainian wheat
26285	3	"After yesterday's aut aut with which Moscow warned that the agreement on the export of Ukrainian wheat could fail if the EU, the USA and Ukraine did not enforce the agreement which simultaneously concerned the export of wheat and Russian fertilizers blocked by sanctions, now the UN comes into play with the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres. Who, applauding the inauguration of the Istanbul Coordination Center for the export of grain from Ukraine - it is one of the formal and substantial aspects of the agreement signed in Istanbul - asks the parties to work to ""effectively apply"" the agreement with the goal of “reducing global food insecurity”."
26285	5	Yesterday Moscow lamented the fact that the double agreement signed in Turkey was not then fulfilled at the point in which the EU and the US should have relaxed the sanctions to allow, as had been decided, Russia to export grain and fertilizers, the latter being fundamental, among other things, for Italian agriculture.
26285	7	"""The secretary-general warmly welcomes the official inauguration of the Joint Coordination Center (JCC) in Istanbul,"" said Guterres' deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Which he underlined as this body ""is made up of representatives of Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the UN""."
26285	9	"""The work of the JCC - added Haq - will allow the safe transport, by merchant ships, of grain, related foods and fertilizers from three main Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea to the rest of the world. This will help respond effectively and prevent the rise of global food insecurity."""
26285	11	“Along with the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between Russia and the UN Secretary-General to promote access of Russian food and fertilizer products to global markets,” Haq said. – The JCC will help restore confidence in the global food market and bring food prices down from current levels.”
26285	13	"Finally, Haq said Guterres ""is grateful to Turkey for providing the parties and the United Nations with a platform to help operationalize the Black Sea Grains Initiative."" And he thanked ""Russia and Ukraine for quickly appointing and sending their representatives to Istanbul""."
26285	15	Now, however, the point is to enforce both parts of the agreement, both the one concerning Ukrainian grain and the one concerning Russian grain and fertilizers.
26296	1	Coal and uranium Thus Putin's gas war is changing the German political balance
26296	3	Faced with the need to find new sources, the Greens and the SPD must be ready to take initiatives that contradict their programmes, such as prolonging the shutdown of nuclear power plants. It is on energy that consensus is now being built and Scholz, posing in front of the (repaired) turbine of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, understood this
26296	5	On Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had his photo taken in front of one of the turbines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, currently stored at the Siemens Energy headquarters in Mülheim an der Ruhr. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the pipeline has been at the center of controversy: German (and European) dependence on Russian gas is one of the main weapons of blackmail in the hands of the Kremlin to discourage the German and EU response to the invasion.
26296	7	Before the conflict, 45% of Germany's gas imports came from Russia. It is a fundamental source of energy for the country's needs, both for its industrial production and in the context of the Energiewende, the energy turnaround which plans to gradually abandon nuclear and fossil sources to invest in renewable ones, with gas as an intermediate measure crucial in this process. Following the Russian invasion, Germany joined the European sanctions, also blocking the activation of Nord Stream 2, the doubling of the already existing gas pipeline that has been much debated at European and global level for years. The work was now completed, but the Scholz government prevented it from being put into operation. Berlin has also diversified its gas supplies: the share of that coming from Russia has been reduced to 35%, but it is unlikely to be able to do without it completely before 2024.
26296	9	With the prolongation and intensification of the sanctions, in recent weeks Moscow has unilaterally decreased the flow of gas to Europe: currently supply volumes are around 40% of pre-conflict levels. To justify the reduction, the Kremlin spoke of technical problems with the pipeline's turbines. One of these was flown to Canada for repairs, but was then detained due to sanctions. Robert Habeck, German Minister of Economy and Climate Protection, has asked Canada to send the turbine to Germany, in order to then be able to ship it in turn to Russia. But at that point, Moscow raised bureaucratic problems for the shipment.
26296	11	"Scholz, therefore, last Wednesday posed in front of the turbine, declaring to the press that ""the turbine works"" and that ""everything is quite clear and simple: the turbine is there, and it can be delivered, but someone has to say clearly that they want it"" . A clear reference to Moscow. Scholz's move is part of the widespread skepticism at European level about the Russian version regarding the interruption of the service, but it also responds to deeply felt needs from Germany. Precisely because of its energy dependence on Russia, in fact, the government has had to take emergency decisions, which in several cases also contradict the direction that the government had announced it would take in the phase of its establishment."
26296	13	This has concerned, in particular, the two main government forces: the Social Democrats, who represent the Chancellor, and the Greens, who have two key ministries in this phase, that of the Economy, in the hands of Robert Habeck, and that of Foreign Affairs, led by Annalena Baerbock. If the delays in sending arms to Ukraine have caused various criticisms of Scholz and the SPD, on the energy front, as it is easy to imagine, it is the Grüne who are under observation: for gas supplies, for example, Germany has discussed with Qatar (to which the Greens have long harbored skepticism).
26296	15	Furthermore, in June, Habeck launched a plan to restart some coal-fired plants to make up for the reduced gas supplies. The decision, obviously, is the result of contingencies, but it is singular that a green minister finds himself having to take it, especially if we consider that his party has been central in anticipating the exit from this fossil source, moving it from 2040 to 2030 .
26296	17	Furthermore, yesterday Scholz declared that Germany could consider prolonging the activity of nuclear power plants. Currently, in fact, the country is in the terminal phase of a long and gradual process of giving up nuclear energy (one of the main political battles of the Greens). According to plans, 2022 should be the last year of activity of the only three nuclear power plants still in operation, but in the past there have been speculations to extend their activity and postpone the definitive shutdown.
26296	19	However useful, the measure, if validated, could still largely respond to the need to give a signal to both Russia and German public opinion, beyond its actual usefulness. There are, in fact, a number of elements to consider.
26296	21	The three active plants, for example, produce 6% of the energy used in Germany (against the 25% generated by seventeen active reactors before the nuclear withdrawal plan): certainly not an irrelevant share, but not a decisive one either. Furthermore, prolonging the activity of the plants would mean producing less energy than expected, according to a government report dating back to March: when the activity of a reactor slowly begins to end due to the lack of unused uranium at the end of its useful life, the Production can be artificially extended for a few months by plant control measures, but at the cost of lower efficiency. For this reason, the report advised against an extension of the periods of activity.
26296	23	Similarly, a real suspension of the nuclear exit plan would be complex not only due to the technical and bureaucratic times that this would require, but also due to the fact that the uranium supply could still lead Berlin to look to Moscow. Furthermore, Scholz's declaration could also respond to the logic of showing himself pragmatic and reactive at a time when he and his party are falling in the approval polls, and are suffering greatly from the growth of the CDU and the high appreciation for Habeck and Baerbock, who have always been opposed to an extension on nuclear power and have only recently become more optimistic.
26296	25	In fact, public opinion seems to be in favor of the measure: at the end of June, 61% of respondents to a survey by Infratest Dimap believed it was right to continue the activity of the plants still operational beyond 2022. According to a Forsa survey of the past few days, today the percentage would have risen to 75%. A fairly distributed judgment among the various electorates, and which concerned more than one person out of two, even among those who voted Green in the last elections.
26296	27	The energy issue, therefore, is central not only for the German economy and for European freedom of action vis-à-vis Moscow, but is increasingly a topic for building political consensus in Germany. How long this phase will last will depend on a series of factors (first of all, the duration of the conflict), but in this scenario, the Greens and the SPD must demonstrate that they are ready for choices that are potentially in contradiction with the government programme, and motivated by the situation created by the invasion of Ukraine.
26300	1	"""Let's save the planet together"": all we needed was the sermon-book by Greta and the Dalai Lama"
26300	3	Rome, July 27 - There is little to do: in this period, environmentalism is on the rise. And it makes a lot of money. That the Greta Thunberg operation is a purely commercial operation is no mystery to anyone. After a couple of years of apnea, between a pandemic and a Russo-Ukrainian war, the iron must be struck now that it's hot again. In fact, the book Together to save the planet: common objectives against climate change, published by Baldini and Castoldi, has just arrived in bookstores. A volume signed by a very strange couple: Greta and the Dalai Lama.
26300	5	Greta and Dalai Lama together
26300	6	Of course, the book is not important, but who wrote it: those who are in fact two influencers. And I'm really sorry to say it, since we're still talking about a spiritual guide (the Dalai Lama, not Greta). As for the contents, the themes are the usual ones of the green arsenal: to safeguard the planet, man must take a step back. In fact, maybe he should just go extinct. The cipher of the volume, in fact, lies precisely in its misanthropic philosophy: at the basis of this philosophy, wrote Francesco Borgonovo on Truth, «there is, deep down, contempt for the human being. The body is nothing but a prison from which to detach as soon as possible, bliss lies in the dissolution of the individual, enlightenment comes only when the detachment from the corruption of reality is completed. In this context, it is not surprising that the most radical environmentalists come to consider man a cancer and to propagandize its extinction, to desire its annihilation and reduction to an organic compound, to garbage (read the texts of the cyberfeminist Donna Haraway for yourself). ».
26300	8	The big manger
26300	9	But there is not only this. It is no coincidence that the book - together with an intervention by Greta herself in the press - has just come out in these days. From 25 to 29 July, in fact, the Climate social camp is taking place in Turin, a European summit of all environmentalists from Greta. The event, of course, is organized on behalf of Thunberg's trademark Fridays for future. And - no less importantly - it received a massive contribution from Askatasuna, a notorious Turin social center linked to the violent No Tav and suspected of subversive activity. Misanthropes, enlightened and companions: a really nice picture for a commercial operation disguised as a splash of green paint.
2631	1	The government places more than 22,000 Ukrainians in Italian schools
2631	3	This demonstrates a total lack of interest in the welfare of Italian children. They always serve the interests of others.
2631	5	Imagine what they can learn, stuck in the schools of a foreign country and the damage they involuntarily do to Italian students.
2631	7	Crazy stuff. We have nothing against Ukrainian children, but obviously they don't even know Italian. What's the point of putting them in schools? To delay the already poor learning of our pupils? And since they come from no vax families, aren't they a problem?
2631	9	From 24 February to today, the Ukrainian students welcomed by the school system are 22,788, of which 5,060 in kindergarten, where there are no places for Italian children, so much so that parents are forced to pay ever higher fees in private schools, 10,399 in elementary school, 5,226 in middle school and 2,103 in high school.
2631	11	The delirious report also contains information on territorial distribution: 21% is concentrated in Lombardy, 12% in Emilia-Romagna and 11% in Campania. This was announced by the Ministry of Non-Education.
2632	1	Migrants, the silent invasion: another 573 landed in Augusta. But Lamorgese doesn't lift a finger
2632	3	The landing of migrants on one of our coasts is a certainty. While the political agreement on the automatic relocation of non-EU citizens recovered along the central Mediterranean route remains a promise. An unattainable mirage faded once again off the coast of Augusta, where the welcome machine, necessarily oiled properly, is continuously in operation. And where, since Monday night, the work of the doctors of the Order of Malta's Italian Aid Corps (Cisom) has not stopped. Intervened together with the Coast Guard in the rescue operations of 573 migrants, including 19 accompanied minors, who were on board two fishing boats 70 miles off Capo Spartivento. Among them also a body.
2632	4	Migrants, this year's landings bulletin is already a record
2632	6	"With them, therefore, the landings bulletin is updated: and as Il Giornale reported in the last few hours, more than four thousand migrants have already landed on the Italian coasts this year. To be exact, ""the illegal immigrants landed essentially in Sicily are: 4701. 3035 in January and 1666 in February"". And precisely, the last rescue operation took place off the Calabrian coast of Capo Spartivento. Where the Diociotti recovered the 573 passengers who, the Coast Guard explained, were in difficulty. “Aboard two overloaded fishing boats. And left at the mercy of the waves», which after being rescued, then landed in Augusta. If we then think that not far from Augusta, exactly in Pozzallo, just a few days ago 338 migrants disembarked from the Ocean Viking, 35 of whom tested positive for Covid and embarked on the Azure quarantine ship at anchor, it is clear how the totals increase and herald the impressive numbers that will materialize with the profusion of landings recorded every summer season, pandemic or not, indifferently…"
2632	8	Migrants, 572 on the ship Diciotti land in Augusta
2632	10	"And so, the Diciotti naval unit also found its berth on the quay of the port of Augusta. Where recognition operations are underway, waiting for the suitable structure to be identified that can host them. Cisom doctors continue to monitor the health conditions of children. Women. Men in trouble. By assuring them of medical care and assistance of all kinds, ""to try to meet basic needs, keeping them warm with the distribution of woolen blankets"", explained by Cisom. In addition to collaborating with ground medical personnel in anti-Covid activities. and all, declined on dizzying numbers. And multiplied by an exponentially increasing number of arrivals."
2632	11	"Meloni: «It is an emergency of illegal immigration. Lamorgese must resign as soon as possible"""
2632	13	"Numbers and difficulties that the government's migration policy, the indifference of the EU, and the inertia of Minister Lamorgese, not only do not stem. But, even, they let it grow dramatically. Parallel to a continuous state of emergency, from time to time buffered here and there, but never decisive. A stalemate that increases criticality and indignation, about which Matteo Salvini thundered again in the last few days: «Another 573 illegal immigrants are arriving. In addition to the more than 4,000 since the beginning of the year. I'm going to trial because I stopped the landings. The current minister does not lift a finger. Because?"". And on which Giorgia Meloni underlined from the opposition: «Daily landings: it is now an emergency for illegal immigration. Nothing will change with Minister Lamorgese at the Interior Ministry. He must resign as soon as possible ». But even on that front, from the Ministry of the Interior everything is silent and nothing is moving…"
2633	1	Greta Thunberg? They put it in mothballs. Guess why…
2633	3	Media power creates, media power destroys. For a while she turns the spotlight on you, after a while she turns it off. And disappear from the scene. At least for some time, waiting for your moment of glory to come back (if it is ever set to come back). This is what is happening to Greta Thunberg. She disappeared from the radar. She doesn't talk anymore and she doesn't talk about it anymore. She doesn't come out anymore. She no longer launches proclamations. What happened?
2633	5	It happened, put brutally, that it is no longer functional to the great global power, the one that had decided until recently to invest massively in the green conversion of the industrial apparatus, on zero emissions, on stopping global warming. And, for this reason, he had decided to spread a new ecological apocalyptic, complete with warnings about impending disasters, such as the rise in sea levels, the melting of the Arctic ice, the desertification of the southern hemisphere.
2633	7	The prophetess of this new ecological verb was precisely the small and resolute Greta. Every invective of hers was followed by millions and millions of followers, by direct streemings, by headlines on the front page and sumptuous services on the news.
2633	9	But now that's not the case anymore. The war in Ukraine has sharply changed interests and priorities. The West has suddenly awakened from the dream of a world without fossil fuels, a world of white mills and smiling cows. Gas and oil will be needed for years to come.
2633	11	So much so that Germany, the leader of the green transition with the Greens in government, has decided to suspend the closure of coal plants. Who cares about the greenhouse effect if Western European society and industry can save something on gas imports as well as secure the energy stocks necessary to sustain GDP and living standards. When economic interests are at stake, the Germans, as we know, don't look anyone in the face.
2633	13	The world ecological circles are not standing by and are sounding the alarm. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, expressed their concern in recent days: «The consequences of the Russian war in Ukraine not only risk destroying global food and energy markets, but could also undermine the global climate agenda . If countries respond to Russia's aggression by increasing their use of fossil fuels, the conflict risks taking us away from achieving global climate goals.
2633	15	"The Apocalypse can wait and Greta Thunberg risks remaining in mothballs for a long time. When her turn comes again, she will be an adult woman, with the ecologism of the ""gretini"" who will have lost her adolescence. And innocence."
2636	1	Sanctions on the oligarchs, Patriarch Kirill urges the faithful to pray for his wallet
2636	3	"Hours of anguish for Patriarch Kirill. In his Sunday sermon in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior and Invader, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church urged the faithful to pray for him, for non-gay Russians but above all for his wallet. «In these difficult times – said the primate – we are witnessing an expansion of NATO towards my bank accounts which threatens my assets estimated at between 4 and 8 billion euros. But God will punish them. And by God, of course, I mean Putin."""
2636	5	"The Russian archbishop then continued, recalling during his sermon the passage from Luke 8:25, ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an oligarch to enter the kingdom of God."" “The Lord's message is clear and assertive: God admonishes us because the eyes of our needles are too narrow. So let's broaden our needles and in general all the tools used for sewing! There are innumerable types of needle, of different sizes and shapes, in relation to the use and thickness of the material to be sewn but God speaks to each of them so that each one surrenders to the Gospel message and enlarges its eye, thus ending to the suffering of the rich! Otherwise, how will the oligarch enter the kingdom of God?? He'll have to shrink himself by miniaturizing beam or with Pym Particles – and of course he can afford it because he's rich – but it's a stress. Let's fight stress, the enemy that comes from the West!»."
2636	7	After this homily, delivered with balled eyes, Kirill invited the faithful to donate generously in church offering boxes, regardless of the fact that the box itself is solid gold.
2636	8	Cyril I made his fortune in the 2000s, when he was head of foreign affairs of the Moscow Patriarchate and Iraq was under a US embargo. At the time, Russia was supporting Iraq by sending basic necessities: the cigarette trade had been entrusted to the Russian Church, which took the tithe and sometimes let in cartons of cigarettes hiding them in the hat of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia.
2636	10	"Kirill praised the holy war against ""the gay lobby"" and Westerners who corrupt Russian customs, blessing the invasion of Ukraine and nuclear missiles. Following his positions, Europe is considering imposing its dreadful sanctions on him too and carrying out targeted actions with a significant impact, for example by sabotaging the waxing of the parquet of his chalet in the canton of Zurich. Even Ukraine is thinking of hitting the Patriarch, withdrawing the decoration of the Order of Jaroslav the Wise of the I Class, conferred on him in 2013, with the motivation ""If you think about it, he is not so wise""."
2636	12	According to Metropolitan Hilarion, while waiting for the pleas of the devotees to come true, Kirill would in any case already be working to run for cover, and to replenish his accounts he would have organized a theatrical tour that will stop in the main Russian theaters including the bombed Mariupol , titled “Orsini is right” and financed by a newspaper of the always free Russian press, “ежедневный сумасшедший” (“Il Matto Quotidiano”).
2640	1	Calenda wants Hungary out of the EU. But there you govern who wins, not who loses (like the Democratic Party with us)
2640	3	"Good first. Yes, we definitely liked Carlo Calenda better who yesterday lambasted Letta for the novice zeal with which he had invoked the immediate embargo on Russian gas. «Bravo Enrico, what do you replace it with?», he had joked. Strange to believe, but today it is the leader of Action who stumbles in the same ardor as the secretary of the Democratic Party in commenting on Giorgia Meloni's satisfaction (""exactly like Putin"", he insinuated in tweet) for the victory of Viktor Orban. And again: «Today Hungary is the fifth column of the Russians, a destination for Italian relocations, financed by European funds which we also pay. We really don't understand what we are waiting for to send them out of the EU"". Eh, how it runs. And then those tones of the master of the ironworks that refer to that corporate vision of politics so popular in the 90s, to which only Berlusconi was able to transplant a popular heart."
2640	4	Calenda against Orban and Meloni
2640	6	"It is impossible to expect it even from Carletto. He is a leftist from Pario who sneaked into politics through Luca Cordero di Montezemolo's ""Italia Futura"", someone who claimed to ride the anti-Casta vulgate agitated by Corriere della Sera with a surname longer than a freight train. Certainly more suited to a career diplomat than a descamisado leader. He noticed it on his own after a dispute in Naples that sent him the pizza sideways: Casta was also him. Hopelessly. It is no coincidence that he was a contra like Beppe Grillo who picked the fruits of the tree shaken from the book by Gian Antonio Stella and Sergio Rizzo. A bitter epilogue, never really archived by Calenda, however quick to recycle himself first as a minister of Renzi (now hated), then as an MEP of the Democratic Party (subsequently repudiated) and finally, in Action, as an apostle of competence."
2640	8	In Italy, elections are now optional
2640	10	If it were just that, it would be perfect. Unfortunately he has stubbornly stuck with politics, which is not exactly his calling. He proved this to the administrative offices of Rome, when faced with a center-right in the jaws he feared its contamination, precluding himself from a possible victory. But anyhow: from that world he wants the votes for free. Indeed, the closer the elections get, the more he burrows to the left, except for firing a few blanks against the 5Stelle, with whom (we bet?) He will soon go to ally. The anti-Meloni sortie is in the script. Like the one against Orban, whom he wants to oust from Europe. Without reflecting that the illiberal Hungarian premier governs by winning the elections, not losing them like the comrades of the Democratic Party. Perhaps, a party to be thrown out of the EU by the super-democratic Calenda would find him more by looking around than by looking for him on the globe.
2642	1	Draghi's reasoned risk: over 50,000 dead since he's been prime minister
2642	3	You can think of it as you like. The numbers tell a clear story: Draghi has failed. His health and vaccination policy has failed.
2642	5	On February 13, 2021 Draghi took over the reins of government with 13,908 coronavirus positives. The positivity rate was at 4.5%. While that day the victims had been 316.
2642	7	There were 2,095 people hospitalized in intensive care, down. Inpatients with symptoms instead 18,736, down.
2642	9	Today, after almost a year of Draghi treatment, the situation has turned upside down. We have almost 400 deaths a day. And we have 19,862 people hospitalized.
2642	11	The only slightly downward figure, around 1,700, is that of intensive care: but we know how it empties them, with the dead.
2642	12	How many since he has dealt with it with mandatory vaccines, green passes and the 'reasoned risk' policy?
2642	14	On February 13, there were 93,356 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. With today's deaths we have reached 143,875: Draghi's policy is responsible for 50,519 deaths.
2642	16	This villainous son of Goldman has caused almost more deaths than the previous government which, it is clear, found itself in a sudden situation.
2642	18	On the other hand, it doubled its landings last year and started 2022 off to a great start.
2642	20	He has to account for it. Yours is a government with a criminal migration and health policy.
2643	1	Revanchist Nazism throughout the Western world
2643	3	We are seeing the return of Nazism, but this time throughout the Western world. Austria, Germany and Italy eliminated civil liberties more completely than did Hitler and Mussolini. Re-Nazified Germany, Austria and Italy destroyed the doctor-patient relationship more completely than Josef Mengele did. The political leaders of this resurrected Nazism are all guilty of crimes under the Nuremberg Laws.
2643	5	Will the US, UK, France and Russia invade these Nazi countries again and execute the leaders for their capital crimes? No. The US, UK, France and Russia [1] are doing the same thing, as are Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
2643	7	Australia has concentration camps, not for Japanese prisoners of war but for Australian citizens suspected of having had contact with someone infected with Covid. Everywhere in the “free” Western world, executive branch officials have shown contempt for constitutional processes by asserting legislative powers and enacting laws in the form of mandates. Parliaments and Congresses have shown their contempt for democratic political systems by accepting the confiscation of their powers and the incorporation of the legislative function into the executive as happened in Rome under the Caesars.
2643	9	In the United States, little Nazis have popped up everywhere. Corporate employers, school boards, university administrators, sports team owners, hospital administrators, mayors and governors have turned out to be so many little Fuhrers issuing illegal orders: Inject yourself and your children with a substance that has been shown not to protect you or anyone else against Covid or any of its variants, but is known to carry a high risk of serious injury and death, or you will be fired and your career over. In re-Nazified Germany/Austria people are threatened with prison if they refuse to play Russian roulette with their health. What government in past history has been so tyrannical? The West has reached the supreme tyranny: your health does not depend on you and your doctor. Your health is controlled by a protocol handed down by a captive regulatory agency that only serves the profits of Big Pharma.
2643	11	The internal passports of the Soviet Union were seen as evidence of an unfree people. Now the entire Western “free” world is faced with internal passports called Covid passports. Once these passports exist, every human right, every civil liberty converts from a right to a privilege subject to government approval. All rights end. Passports are issued to compliant citizens who, thanks to their servitude, gain privileges to go to restaurants, bars, sporting events and other forms of entertainment, to travel and to keep their jobs.
2643	13	It is no longer the government that is accountable to the citizens; are the citizens accountable to the government.
2643	15	Freedom is thus redefined as slavery as in George Orwell's dystopia, 1984.
2643	17	In the United States the only people who have died of Covid have been people with weakened immune systems due to comorbidities who have been refused treatment with safe drugs known as Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin which also act as preventatives. To avoid Covid deaths, all that was needed was to protect the most vulnerable with preemptive doses of hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin.
2643	19	"Instead, people infected with Covid were buried in nursing homes filled with elderly people with immune problems. No one was treated, because the emergency use authorization given to the so-called ""vaccine"" provided that there were no known cures. So Big Pharma and the captured regulatory agencies — FDA, NIH, CDC, WHO — campaigned against hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Both were said to be dangerous and unapproved (a double lie). False claims were published by the whores of the press that hospitals were full of people sick with ivermectin, allegedly a drug for horses. Hospital administrators accepted the protocol handed to them by Fauci and Big Pharma that hospitals must prevent any treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin regardless of doctor's orders. The utterly corrupt American Medical Association has accepted this violation of the doctor/patient relationship."
2643	21	When word got out that American hospitals were being paid to kill infected patients, not treat them, family members had to go to the judiciary for a court order to force the hospital's murderous administrators to allow the doctor of a patient to save his life with ivermectin!
2643	23	The question desperately begging to be investigated and answered is: who, what agency, under what authority, with what appropriate money established the incentives for American hospitals to kill people to increase their revenues?
2643	25	This is the greatest crime in American history. Persons responsible for this should be arrested, tried, convicted and executed. Each of them is guilty of mass murder.
2643	27	"But nothing will happen, because the media will not allow any truth to be reported about the Covid deception. Believe it or not, the American media is more compliant as a propaganda ministry than the media was under Stalin in the Soviet Union. In Soviet times the media developed the ""technique of writing"" so that the reader read between the lines. But in ""free"" America where the press is protected by the First Amendment, the decision was made that revenue was more important to the media's existence than the truth. Thus, US press, TV and NPR media became agents for those who provided them with advertising revenue or under the table profits."
2643	29	Once again here are the Covid mortality and survival rates by age group of the untreated Covid infected. The left column is the death rate by age, the right column is the survival rate by age. Remember, the people who died were, on Fauci's orders, prohibited from treatment with the well-known life-saving drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
2643	31	Clearly, this is not a dangerous pandemic and certainly not one that requires the permanent destruction of accountable governance achieved over the centuries. Fauci and his evil race have returned the entire Western world to the era of slaves and serfs, in which no one can speak except the ruler.
2643	33	"Facing the fact that the destruction of Western freedom was accomplished by a handful of cheap totalitarian punks like Fauci, not tyrants of stature like Stalin and Hitler, reveals how empty the West has become to an educational ""system"" which for decades has questioned every Western conquest and every Western value. Public schools and universities, along with media whores and Hollywood, prepare the American people for the loss of their freedom."
2643	35	"Think about it. How many relatives and former friends do you have who, if you are not ""vaccinated"", will have nothing to do with you, who tell you that you are selfish and don't care about others, that you risk exposing others to death and harm for not be vaccinated. This is the narrative of Big Pharma and your former friends and relatives believe Big Pharma's selfish and profitable lies and are instead immune to known and published facts with which you unsuccessfully attempt to inform them."
2643	37	People who are unable to think for themselves – the majority of the population – are easily brainwashed and indoctrinated. It is not a population that can defend its freedom or impose responsible government. It's a shit population that turns against those who would restore her freedom, not against those who deprive her of her freedom.
2643	39	However, those brave few — frontier doctors, Covid ethics doctors, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and thousands of independent physicians and scientists (the ones who haven't received grants from Big Pharma) — who stand up for freedom do because it is freedom they are defending. They are defending a human enterprise – the work of a few people – that took centuries from Alfred the Great in the 9th century to the Glorious Revolution in 1680. The fact that young people today have never heard of Alfred the Great or the Glorious Revolution demonstrates how education has completely erased the achievements of Western history. America, indeed the entire Western world, no longer has a population enculturated in Western values.
2643	41	It was this human achievement – ​​responsible government – ​​that the Founding Fathers of the United States responded to with the demands of the Declaration of Independence and the protections of the United States Constitution.
2643	43	"The discrediting of these founding documents has been the primary function of American education for decades. Today we see the result: the American people, and also those of the Western world, have sold their freedom for a ""vaccine"" that harms health and kills, but does not protect against Covid."
2645	1	EU PLANS TO INCREASE IMMIGRATION
2645	3	Hungary launches new anti-immigrant media campaign targeting George Soros and EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, accused of facilitating illegal immigration.
2645	5	"The Budapest government Facebook page explains that the campaign includes posters with images of stateless billionaire Soros and a smiling Juncker above the words ""You too have the right to know what Brussels is preparing""."
2645	6	"""They want to introduce mandatory reception quotas, weaken the right of member states to defend borders, facilitate immigration with migrant visas"", we read."
2645	8	"Viktor Orban's government, which has often clashed with the EU over migration, has already waged similar campaigns in the past, including ""Let's stop Brussels"" and ""Don't let Soros have the last laugh""."
2645	10	"In recent years Orban has called the 88-year-old stateless speculator a ""public enemy"" because he advocates mass uncontrolled immigration."
2645	12	"""Brussels continues to support illegal immigration,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in Budapest. “Hungarians need to know this and that is why the latest information campaign was launched,” he added, denying that it is part of the campaign for the next European Parliament elections."
2645	14	"According to Kovacs, in the ""drawers of Brussels"" there are plans to increase funding for NGOs and to create a special fund for migrants."
2647	1	Europe gets rid of Scholz before it's too late
2647	3	"A few days ago we wrote that Europe has a chance of continuing to count on the international arena only if it agrees to rely on Macron. Merit of the French president, of course, but ""merit"" above all of the incredible weakness of Olaf Scholz, the most impalpable German chancellor since the time of the Weimar Republic."
2647	5	From the birth of the EEC onwards, we have been used to seeing Germany impose the most important choices in economic and diplomatic matters on all of Europe, alone or with the help of France. But since Angela Merkel left power something has jammed: Scholz seems unable to make any decision. In the last two weeks he has remained silent in the face of all the main questions that have been posed to him by the press and colleagues: he has not been able to explain what he intends to do on the Stability Pact (shall we change it or not?), on the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline (the freezes or not?) about sending weapons to Ukraine (do we send them or not?).
2647	7	"His pathetic attempt to ""buy time"" while waiting for problems to resolve themselves has allowed Macron, one who certainly does not waste time occupying the spaces vacated by others, to take command of the European caravanserai. Like it or not, on fundamental issues such as energy supplies, the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis and relations with the other superpowers, the European Union is destined to speak French."
2647	9	"According to the prestigious newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, Scholz's indolence ""is damaging transatlantic relations more than Trump ever did"", commenting acidly that ""when the American president does more to prevent a war in Europe than the German chancellor, there it is something wrong with German foreign policy.”"
2647	11	It is true that Scholz's weakness is the result first of all of the insane policies of Angela Merkel, who handed over Germany hand and foot to Russia and China, two authoritarian countries governed by immovable regimes. In the case of Russia, the subordination is due to the construction of the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, which directly connects the two countries via the Baltic Sea and makes Germany completely dependent on supplies from Moscow. In the case of China, the fact that in recent years Germany has focused heavily on exports to the Chinese market, leaving a large part of its GDP to depend on the willingness of the Chinese to buy goods made in Germany. So now Scholz knows he cannot move against the two countries without risking painful retaliation.
2647	13	"That is not enough: according to the specialized site Politico, some EU officials and diplomats have admitted that Berlin has even worked in the shadows to prevent the definition of a common European position against China. Scholz's office feared that the EU was ""defending too much"" Lithuania against economic coercion from Beijing, so much so that dozens of phone calls were sent from the chancellery to all German-speaking Commissioners to ease the pressure on them as much as possible. of Beijing, opposing among other things the hard line of Paris. Obviously, the fact that Lithuania is a member state of the EU does not appear to Scholz as a sufficient reason to defend it against a ferocious dictatorship."
2647	15	It must be repeated: if this is the quality of leadership that Berlin can offer, Draghi did well to bind himself to the French with the Quirinal Pact. For heaven's sake, Macron is not De Gasperi and is afflicted by the usual delusions of grandeur so common across the Alps, but at least he has a slightly more articulated idea of ​​Europe than that of Scholz, who seems increasingly to have ended up by chance covering what it is (was?) the most important post on the continent.
2648	1	"Putin's adviser warns of ""global famine"" by the end of this year"
2648	3	"One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's top aides has warned that a ""global famine"" could begin by the end of 2022, due to grain shortages caused by the conflict in Ukraine."
2648	5	"""It is important that in the conditions, for example, of a global famine that will occur around the autumn, by the end of this year all over the world, Russia does not have to suffer, but is fully supplied with food"" Putin adviser Maxim Oreshkin said at a forum in Moscow last week, according to state media Rt."
2648	7	"Oreshkin said the famine will, in part, be caused by US monetary policy. ""Until around 2020, world market wheat prices were stable, but following the increased dollar printing that started around July 2020, prices started to rise sharply,"" he said, referring to Washington's measures. to cope with the effect of the lockdown policies. “Indeed, what America is trying to do now with Ukraine is eliminate the grain reserves Ukraine currently has in its possession, which is just yet another action dooming Ukraine to serious problems. humanitarians, and also condemns the global community to have big problems with hunger."
2648	9	The AFP news agency reports that in the meantime, according to Oreshkin, Russia has been actively preparing for a possible shortage of grain: «Russia is actively preparing for a global famine; it all started at the end of last year».
2648	11	However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the United Nations Security Council accused Moscow of blockading Ukrainian ports with warships last week, accusing Russia of using food as a weapon of war: «It appears that the Russian government he thinks using food as a weapon will help accomplish what his invasion failed to do: […] break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. As a result of the Russian government's actions, some 20 million tons of grain remain unused in Ukrainian silos. Last week, wheat prices hit an all-time high after India, the world's second largest wheat producer, said it would halt wheat exports. Following India's announcement, the price of wheat futures rose 5.9% on May 16 to hit an all-time high of $12.68 per bushel.
2648	13	Both Russia and Ukraine, meanwhile, account for about a third of total grain supplies. Ukraine is also a major exporter of barley, corn, sunflower oil and canola oil.
2648	15	Blinken also rejected Russian claims that US economic sanctions against Russia were responsible for the price hike: “The sanctions imposed by the US and many other countries deliberately include exemptions for food, fertilizers and seeds from Russia. The decision to weaponize food belongs only to Moscow».
2649	1	Turkey does not want “supporters of terrorism” in NATO
2649	3	Sweden and Finland have not yet responded to Ankara's security requests, President Erdogan said
2649	5	"Turkey will not approve Finland and Sweden's NATO membership applications until they properly address Ankara's concerns about their alleged support for terrorist organizations, President Erdogan said, vowing not to repeat ""the mistakes of the past""."
2649	7	"""As long as Tayyip Erdogan is at the head of the Republic of Turkey, we will absolutely not be able to say 'yes' to the entry into NATO of countries that support terrorism,"" the Turkish leader told reporters returning from a trip to Azerbaijan, according to reports yesterday, Sunday 29 May, by the state media."
2649	9	Delegations from Sweden and Finland met with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara for talks last week, following the joint application by the Nordic countries to join the US-led military alliance. Despite the meeting, however, the Ankara government has once again threatened to block the process unless the two countries crack down on groups it considers extremist.
2649	11	"“They are not honest and sincere,” Erdogan said of the results of the talks. ""They do not take the necessary measures, they continue to allow terrorists to walk freely on the streets of Stockholm and provide them with their own police security."" ""We cannot repeat the same mistake made in the past towards these countries that host and feed terrorists"", added Erdogan, referring to the long-standing feud with Athens over Cyprus, and recalling how in 1980 Ankara ""allowed Greece to return"" after his partial withdrawal from NATO."
2649	13	"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has previously acknowledged that Finland and Sweden are unlikely to become NATO members if they do not meet Turkey's demands. ""No country has suffered as much from terrorist attacks as Turkey,"" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding that Turkey is an ""important ally and when an ally has concerns it should be discussed and the problem resolved."""
2649	15	We recall that joining the Alliance of the two Nordic countries requires the unanimous consent of all 30 member states and Turkey has threatened to block the process unless Finland and Sweden crack down on groups that Ankara considers extremist.
2650	1	Johnson's handshake with bin Salman... the 'moral' lesson!
2650	3	In Saudi Arabia, various sectors of the public gave a moral 'no' to Britain saying: 'Johnson's handshake with an autocrat who has just committed mass murder' means that 'Britain is ready to do a deal with the devil to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.
2650	5	The article published yesterday by the newspaper and written by the director of the legal charity, Reprieve, which tracks grave human rights abuses, indicated that Boris Johnson's visit to Saudi Arabia came after the Gulf kingdom executed 81 men a few days ago, asking: Johnson don't you quite understand public opinion in Britain? Or did things change after the Russian war against Ukraine?
2650	7	Although the writer said that “Johnson's handshake with an autocrat who had just presided over a mass murder would damage Britain's moral standing on the world stage,” she explained that “in the weeks following the invasion of Russian forces in Ukraine, there was a feeling that the calculation has changed. Increasingly, Conservative ministers are saying the government should do everything it can to reduce Britain's dependence on Russian gas and that it should make a deal with the devil, Mark Almond, director of the Institute for Crisis, told the Daily Mail. Research.
2650	9	"Writer Maya Foa said that ""since Jamal Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and assassinated, Western leaders have mostly shied away from the kingdom, avoiding taking pictures with the crown prince."""
2650	11	Foa felt that “the timing of the executions is appalling. Less than two weeks ago, The Atlantic ran a lengthy interview with the crown prince promoting comprehensive updates to the Saudi criminal justice system.
2650	13	"He added that by visiting Saudi Arabia, ""Johnson confirms that the Saudi authorities can kill whoever they want, at any time, and the West will ignore it."""
2650	15	"“The Kingdom of Saudi effectively ensures that more people are executed whose only crime was to challenge the status quo,” he said. People like Hassan al-Maliki, a cleric who is currently facing the death penalty for the contents of his library."""
2650	17	"Foa explained: “Saudi justice is a black box we can never be sure of. The European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, which maintains a comprehensive record of executions in Saudi Arabia, was unaware of even 69 cases (out of the 81 that were executed). These men were tried, convicted and executed in complete secrecy."""
2650	19	“Out of the 12 we know of, at least three of them are likely to have been tortured to make false confessions of terrorist offenses after participating in pro-democracy demonstrations,” he said.
2650	21	He said that while “authorities describe the executed men as terrorists, there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders and people who were arrested as children on death row. “
2650	23	He recalled that in 2014 the British and Saudi governments signed a memorandum of understanding on judicial cooperation.
2650	25	“My organization, Reprieve, made a request based on the right to know, but it was rejected on the grounds that the disclosure of information could negatively impact the effective management of international relations,” said the author. Because of this secrecy, we have no idea whether British assistance supported a torture- and execution-based justice system in Saudi Arabia.”
2650	27	"He added: “What we know from European-Saudi Human Rights Organization reports and media monitoring is that in the period this deal has been implemented, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has significantly increased the frequency of executions, so so far there have been more than 900 cases since 2015. In January alone, the British Justice Minister, Dominic Raab, met his counterpart, Sheikh Walid Al-Samaani, and said he was happy to hear about the progress of Saudi Arabia in Judicial Reform and Human Rights. He was considered a fool."""
2650	29	“The Prime Minister's trip to Riyadh shortly after this mass execution is a shame for him personally and for Britain,” said Maya Foa. Would anyone in his inner circle tell him that there are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than to encourage and enable a murderous system?
2650	31	Here we have to say that the West, which proved to us to be racist when it differentiated between refugees from Ukraine and refugees from Asia and Africa. The Netherlands has also expelled Syrian refugees, and has welcomed blond-haired, blue-eyed Ukrainians, as portrayed in the Western press, as well as Britain's moral claims, with enthusiasm. Its Prime Minister meets bin Salman and shakes his hand with hands stained with the blood of people who have done nothing but ask for something like equality and democracy, that is the moral reputation of the West.
2666	1	The war against the unvaccinated will not be forgotten
2666	3	If you have refused to accept the official narrative about Covid vaccines, you have probably found yourself suffering hateful attacks and rejections. Some of these zealots may now realize they were wrong, but few want to talk about it. How do you choose to move forward?
2666	5	Fomenting hatred is a tool of tyrants, and over the past two years, political leaders, agency directors, academics, medical professionals and media personalities have publicly encouraged hatred and violence and wished a painful death on anyone he didn't want to be part of that medical experiment that is the Covid vaccines.
2666	7	In an eloquent post on Medium, journalist Susan Dunham summarizes the lessons (hopefully) learned from hate and the attack on the unvaccinated (1):
2666	9	“Obligations have been relaxed, and both sides are stumbling back into something resembling the old normal – except there is a new and current wound inflicted on the people we have been trying to break. And nobody wants to talk about it.
2666	11	Just a few weeks ago, our own leaders admitted they wanted to make life unlivable for the unvaccinated. And as an empowered collective, we have multiplied the pain, bringing the struggle into our families, friendships and workplaces. Today we face the hard truth that none of this was warranted, and in doing so, we discover a valuable lesson.
2666	13	It was a rapid slide from righteousness to cruelty, and much as we may blame our leaders for the push, we are responsible for falling into the trap despite better judgment.
2666	15	We knew that declining immunity equated large numbers of the vaccinated with a dwindling minority of the unvaccinated, yet we marked them for special persecution. We said they had not “done the right thing” by turning away from state care, even though we knew that principled opposition to such a thing is priceless under any circumstances…
2666	17	And so it was that, thanks to willful ignorance of science, civics, and politics, we oppressed the unvaccinated to the point where we did… We cannot hold our heads up, as if we believe we have logic, love or truth on our side as we fiercely wish death on the unvaccinated. The best we can do is sit in the awareness of our angry inhumanity at having marginalized so many people…
2666	19	Opposing them has been a tremendous embarrassment for many of us, who now understand that obligations only had the power that we gave them. It was not through quiet acquiescence that we avoided the endless dominance of drug companies and door-to-door medical checkups.
2666	21	"It was thanks to the people we tried to bring down… We took the bait by hating them, but their persistence gave us time to realize we were wrong. Now it looks like obligations will return, but this time there is hope that many of us will see them for what they are: a growing authoritarianism that doesn't care about our well-being."""
2666	23	Forgive and forget?
2666	25	Dunham approaches the situation from the perspective of those who have fallen prey to the hypnotic command to despise anyone – including friends and family – who refuse to believe the official narrative about Covid vaccines. However, most of you have probably been victims of these attacks.
2666	27	How did you choose to deal with them? What have you learned? I suspect many of you are willing to forgive, but few will ever forget those betrayals. But as Dunham noted, nobody really wants to talk about what was done.
2666	29	"Everyone carries on as if it never happened. As if our leaders didn't ask for our deaths. As if our president hadn't warned us that his patience with us was ""running out"" (2) - a threat that implied that bad things would happen once his patience ran out. As if news anchors like Don Lemon hadn't said we deserved to starve and shouldn't have walked into a grocery store (3), (4). But these things they said, and family and friends rejected us as a result."
2668	1	Zelensky holograms: War projects us into the future
2668	3	That war and technological development go hand in hand is now almost known to everyone, and a similar argument can be made by thinking about the combination of war and propaganda. However, what had no clear connection up to now was the relationship between technological development and propaganda.
2668	5	Of course, any new creation that can be sold to the public always goes through its advertising before being launched on the market but, up to now, events so shamelessly aimed at welding technology with war propaganda, thus going beyond simple advertising, are hardly remembered in recent history. as we have understood it up to now in the world of consumption.
2668	7	Today it happens instead that, after the tour in the various national Parliaments and the appearances here and there, the Zelensky phenomenon also arrives in the various tech festivals underway or recently completed in various European capitals. And what better way to do that than through a hologram.
2668	9	Yes, you understood correctly, as reported in the article in the source, also taken from the Italian site drcommodore.it, holograms of Zelensky appeared at the VivaTech fair in Paris, at the Brilliant Minds in Stockholm, at the Founders Forum in London and at The Next Web in Amsterdam, and in all cases the script was the same.
2668	11	The Ukrainian president, by now a real star of the western mob, has once again asked for help to defeat his Russian enemies, in this case, however, not by turning to governments but to private citizens. And to encourage them too to invest money in the Ukrainian cause, here is the tempting offer: invest in Ukraine and you will be the promoters of an experiment aimed at creating the first digital government (in spite of the Ukrainians who are willing to die for European values ​​like says von der Leyen).
2668	13	"""No other country in the world will offer you such an attractive chance to try the most advanced technologies at the state level. It is an experiment, a digital revolution and, at the same time, a modernization of the current system."""
2668	15	– announced one of Zelensky's holograms
2668	17	Hence, a simple war is shamelessly revealed for what it really is: an experiment…not just a social one to test the reaction of the European peoples to sacrifice in the name of defense of Ukraine, not just a military one to test new weapons in the field, including new drones and the like, not only political to see what happens if a comedian becomes a politician and then an influencer, but also – and perhaps above all at this point, given the looming digital/virtual/green revolution – technological.
2668	19	What will become of Ukraine is not yet clear, many different and overlapping interests vie for that portion of territory, like rabid dogs vying for a slice of meat. What is certain is that there is an increasingly visible common thread linking the pandemic and war, aimed at a complete transformation of the Western lifestyle. Too bad that instead of looking for this thread, most people stop to look at Zelensky's holograms.
2679	1	China, communist indoctrination never dies: Xi Jinping becomes a school subject in elementary school
2679	3	Communists are like the wolves of proverbs: they shed their hair, but not their vice. What is happening in China is emblematic, where the unique communist thought of its president Xi Jinping reaches elementary schools.
2679	5	"Xi Jinping's thought even ends up in elementary school. In fact, he will enter the school curriculum throughout China to strengthen the ""Marxist"" and ""patriotic"" approach of national education."
2679	7	From Mao's Little Red Book to Xi Jinping's Thought
2679	9	"The Ministry of Education has issued a ""guide"" to teaching materials for courses on the thought of the Chinese president. ""Xi Jinping's ideological system of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is rigorous, logical, full of broad and profound connotations,"" said ministry textbook bureau director Tian Huisheng, quoted in a statement. by the Chinese media, and it is ""necessary to fully and accurately understand the essence of the Chinese leader's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era"""
2679	11	The thought of the leader of the Beijing regime, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party in China, will have to be introduced in all courses of study, from primary to university education. Xi's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era entered the Chinese constitution in 2018, at the beginning of his second term as president, and at the end of a process of consolidating Xi at the top of power that culminated in the elimination of the constraint of the double mandate at the helm of the state, which paved the way for his leadership indefinitely.
2679	13	The Chinese president has lifted the two-term constraint
2679	15	Xi Jinping, 68, with a degree in chemical engineering, has imposed changes to the Constitution since 2018 that will allow him as president of the People's Republic of China to exceed the two-term limit (ten years in total) that was introduced in 1982, as reaction to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, attributed to the undisputed authority of Mao Tse-tung. The highest state office is the prerogative of Xi Jinping, who simultaneously exercises the role of party secretary. He has been President of the People's Republic of China since 14 March 2013.
2684	1	NATO lies implode… Kiev regime told :”Pay the price for peace”
2684	3	The lasting damage of the crumbling lies is the erosion of supposed leadership by the US and NATO accomplices.
2684	5	The Biden administration, the Western news media (aka the propaganda system) and the NATO military axis are in a head-on collision with reality. An early sign is the abatement of the aggressive stance and their petty regime in Kiev has been urged to cut losses and make a deal with Russia.
2684	7	"For the past four months since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine, Western public opinion has been filled with nonstop lies about Moscow's ""illegal aggression"", about how Russia was losing the war because of the "" heroic defenders” and how NATO was upholding inviolable principles of Ukrainian sovereignty that somehow “justified” the flood of weapons into the country."
2684	9	"Now Jens Stoltenberg, the civilian head of the US-led transatlantic alliance, is tentatively waving a white flag of surrender to the inevitable reality. Speaking at a conference in Finland last weekend, Stoltenberg urged the Kiev regime to ""pay the price for peace"" by ceding territorial claims to Russia. The former Norwegian premier, comical wooden statuette that he is, is no doubt used as a mouthpiece for more strategic planners in the transatlantic establishment."
2684	11	"The ""price for peace"" would involve the recognition by the Ukrainian authorities of the Crimean peninsula as part of the Russian Federation and the independence of the republics of Donbass. The Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24 was launched to defend those Russian-speaking territories against offensives by the NATO-backed Kiev regime and its Nazi battalions."
2684	13	This marks a surprising about-face by the NATO bloc. Since the CIA-sponsored coup in Kiev in 2014 and the secession of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, Moscow has been continually vilified for allegedly annexing the peninsula as the United States and its European Union allies have piled round after round of economic sanctions.
2684	15	"The alleged restoration of Ukraine's ""territorial integrity"" has been a recurring motif for the growing hostility of the US-led NATO axis towards Russia. Now, however, the head of the NATO bloc is telling the Kiev regime that it better prepare to cede territory for the sake of peace. So much for the principle! And what was the point of all these years of escalating economic sanctions against Russia over Crimea?"
2684	17	The shift in thinking reflects the nascent reality that the Russian military intervention in Ukraine is indeed proving to be a success. Moscow secured Russian-speaking regions and severely damaged the Nazi-infested Ukrainian army. Even the idea of ​​Ukraine joining NATO is out of the question.
2684	19	Just a few weeks ago, Western governments and their respectful media were awash with claims that Russia was facing a strategic defeat by NATO-armed Ukrainian forces. US President Joe Biden and his Secretary of State Antony Blinken showed confidence in this.
2684	20	So is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his top foreign diplomat, Liz Truss. What will they say now?
2684	22	"The Nazi nature of the Ukrainian forces has been covered up in stories of ""heroic defenders"". When Russia consolidated its fighting power in eastern Ukraine to take Donbass, Western media gleefully reported this as a retreat. On the contrary, several independent military analysts and sources on the ground were giving the opposite and more accurate view, claiming that the Russian forces and their allies in Donbass were doing exactly what they set out to do: liberate the Russian-speaking territory."
2684	24	Now that Russia is well on its way to achieving its goals, the Western propaganda narrative is crumbling due to the lies it has always been built upon.
2684	26	"There will be a lot of gnashing of teeth over the failure of the final propaganda. The debacle in Afghanistan will look like a sideshow of this epic failure. Hundreds of billions of dollars and euros of US and NATO weapons sent to Ukraine have done nothing to ""defend"" the country. You have been a boon to the military-industrial complex and its political mercenaries. But the wave of weapons hasn't stopped Russia from achieving its goals."
2684	28	"The conflict's global economic fallout — entirely avoidable if the United States and its NATO partners had engaged diplomatically with Russia to resolve Moscow's longstanding security woes — has hit Western states with a vengeance. Rising energy prices and bills are seriously harming millions of workers who see the economic calamity not as Russia's fault (so-called ""Putin's price hike"") but as a result of Washington and Brussels' geopolitical games and indifference elitist. This is just another facet of reality – one of the immense implications of an unprecedented social upheaval – that is forcing the Western ruling class to bail out Ukraine's disaster."
2684	30	"The head-on collision with reality will create explosive reactions. The Western powers are already moving Kiev towards accepting her fate as a redundant pawn. Stoltenberg's advice to ""pay a price for peace"" is the overture to Kiev being told to get real and cut her losses. Western audiences will rightly see through this opportunity and utter unscrupulousness and wonder what all the fake drama and ridiculous taxpayer funded spending was all about. An angry backlash is coming for the charlatans in charge."
2684	32	We can expect the Western media to start looking for scapegoats to “explain” Russia's success. Point to reports like this recent one from the New York Times that blames Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for tactical mistakes. But the insufferable victimhood of the Kiev regime and its over-the-top comedian-turned-president will no doubt rage and redouble with impossible demands for American and NATO “defense.” Zelensky has a knack for naming and shaming perceived lack of indulgence. He was primed to function this way and his Western celebrity status gives him a false sense of importance.
2684	34	History is littered with CIA-sponsored puppets that outlive their usefulness and are then discarded like garbage. If Zelensky and his clique get angry by not playing catch with the US and their NATO partners trying to hide their pack of lies, i.e. by not accepting his role as scapegoat, then Zelensky will face a “pension plan” more energetic.
2684	36	"But ultimately the lasting damage of the unraveling lies is the erosion of supposed leadership by the US and NATO accomplices. Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided US claims as ""the empire of lies"". It is turning out to be an objective fate."
2685	1	Austria, Kurz: “We don't welcome Afghan refugees, we have too many. Stop illegal immigration”
2685	3	"We will not welcome into our country any fleeing Afghan, not under my power"". For Sebastian Kurz, the 2015 refugee policy cannot be the solution, neither for Kabul nor for the European Union. And even in the face of a humanitarian emergency such as the Afghan one, the Austrian chancellor maintains, in an interview with La Stampa, that ""our position is realistic: the integration of Afghans is very difficult and requires a expenditure of energy that we cannot afford""."
2685	4	Austria's no to Afghan refugees
2685	6	"With more than 44,000 Afghans entering our country in recent years, Austria already hosts the fourth largest Afghan community in the world, if we consider the distribution of migrants by number of inhabitants. There are far more Afghan refugees living with us than those who have taken over Italy or other EU states. This year alone, around 8,000 refugees have arrived here, a fifth of them from Kabul, via the still open Balkan route""."
2685	8	"The difficulty of integrating Afghans, according to Kurz, lies above all in ""their level of education, mostly low and divergent in fundamental values. Let's think carefully about this fact: more than half of young Afghans already living in Austria, for example, support violence if their religion is outraged. Therefore, when it is said that we are not in solidarity, this is not true. We are focusing on supporting Afghanistan's neighboring countries, to provide protection and assistance to Afghans in the region. The dramatic developments in Kabul took everyone by surprise. We must now put massive pressure on the Taliban to continue to respect women's rights and human rights. The progress made over the last 20 years must not be undone. The EU can and will exert pressure together with its international partners. Furthermore, it should focus on supporting neighboring states to take care of refugees and the fight against Islamic terrorism, especially Isis-K""."
2685	10	"Austrian Chancellor Kurz: ""Enough with illegal immigration"""
2685	12	"For the Austrian chancellor, “it is now clear to all European governments that illegal immigration must be fought and Europe's external borders must be made secure. We must in no way repeat the mistakes of 2015: unlimited entry. Also because the conditions since then have changed in various parts of the world. We have been pursuing this line for years, but now many other states see it as we do. Countries governed by social democrats such as Sweden and Denmark are also pursuing a restrictive migration policy. In order for there to be no more flows like six years ago, we must break the business model of human smugglers, stop irregular migrants at the external borders and return them to their countries of origin or to safe third countries""."
2685	14	On the hypothesis of the creation of a common European defence, Kurz states that “Austria is a small neutral country in the heart of Europe, but we participate in the Union's foreign and security policy, in the PSDC and CFSP defense projects, which need to be further implemented. We also make a disproportionate contribution to peacekeeping missions, for example in the Western Balkans, Mali or Lebanon. Instead, the proposal of the candidate for chancellor in Germany, Armin Laschet, of a European FBI deserves careful examination: the Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, in Berlin, Paris, Nice or Vienna, have clearly demonstrated that Europe must collaborate even more so in the fight against Islamic terrorism”.
2689	1	They rape women, old people and children: immigrants out of control
2689	3	"It was just after dawn on 9 August 2021 when a 26-year-old girl was surprised from behind, dragged by the arm and raped in the excavation for the water pipes of a construction site in Cascina Gobba, a stone's throw from the San Raffaele hospital, by an Egyptian aged 31 without a regular residence permit. On 6 December, however, a young commuter was attacked on the Milan-Varese train by two boys in their early twenties. The first, the one who would have acted as a ""stake"", is an Italian citizen with drug addiction problems; the other - the perpetrator of the attempted rape - is a Moroccan with a police record and illegal on Italian territory. And then the horror of New Year's Eve: dozens of girls are harassed by a gang of foreigners a stone's throw from the Milan Cathedral during the celebrations for the start of the new year."
2689	5	“The Istat data speak for themselves: foreigners are five times more responsible than Italians for the crimes of sexual violence – specifies the commissioner Riccardo De Corato – Despite the tightening of penalties, harassment and rapes do not decrease. Policies in favor of respect for women seem to have failed to take hold of a part of the foreign population - and the very serious episode that took place on New Year's Eve in Piazza Duomo confirms this - which continues to consider women as an object, a property of which man can do what he wants”.
2689	7	"""Please stop."" That desperate cry, then the horror of the clandestine:"
2689	9	"On June 2, several teenagers were harassed with shocking harassment on the train to Peschiera after returning from a morning spent on Lake Garda. The perpetrators, not yet all identified, allegedly addressed racist insults to the young victims: ""You are white, you must not stay here (on the train, ed.)."" A worrying phenomenon, which marks a negative record in Lombardy, that relating to sexual crimes."
2689	11	“In our capital (Milan ed) the trend of recent years has never seen a decline, unfortunately – adds De Corato – Indeed it is growing slightly given that from 273 cases in 2011 it went to 285 in 2021. In my opinion the situation is very worrying”.
2690	1	Italy remains almost the only country to still impose the use of masks
2690	3	Almost 30 months after the start of the pandemic and despite the declared end of the state of emergency, Italy remains almost the only country to still impose the use of masks in some places, including schools, despite the distancing imposed and strictly adhered to by the children at the counter. Beyond the environmental impact, it is necessary to seriously evaluate their usefulness and potential harmful effects on the health of the wearer.
2690	5	In a study published in May 2020, Dr. Alberto Donzelli had critically analyzed the RCTs reported in a previous systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of medical masks in preventing respiratory infections in university/community settings and outdoor gatherings. The study also highlighted the possible undesirable effects deriving from the prolonged and incorrect use of the masks:
2690	7	"“There are certain, multiple and underestimated risks of a dermatological type, up to lesions that can constitute other gateways for pathogens. [...] In fact, in unaware infected subjects, in which the emission of viruses is maximum in the two days preceding the symptoms (which may not even appear at all!), the mask obliges a continuous respiratory recirculation of their viruses, adding resistance to exhalation, with the concrete risk of pushing a high viral load deep into the alveoli, which could be defeated by the innate defenses if it only impacted the upper respiratory tract, well supplied with ready-made IgA and IgG."""
2690	9	Why is this device still made excessive and excessive use to curb transmission and why does the Government still impose its use, without taking into account the negative and harmful aspects? What do we know more today than that study of May 2020 and the many randomized controlled trials conducted before and during the pandemic that still justify the persistence of this (once again) all-Italian anomaly?
2690	11	To the many that already exist, several new interesting studies have been added that highlight the damage caused by the masks; just to name a few:
2690	13	- Is a Mask That Covers the Mouth and Nose Free from Undesirable Side Effects in Everyday Use and Free of Potential Hazards? which refers to 44 experimental studies and 65 publications to conclude that the prolonged use of the mask generates important effects and consequences under various medical aspects.
2690	14	- Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air With or Without Face Masks in Healthy Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial which highlights how masks of any type cause an increase in carbon dioxide in children exceeding the limits considered acceptable up to now.
2690	15	"- Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe ""Although no cause-effect conclusions can be deduced from this observational analysis - conclude the study authors -, the lack of negative correlations between mask use and of Covid-19 suggests that the widespread use of masks at a time when effective intervention was most needed, i.e. during the sharp fall-winter 2020-2021 peak, was unable to reduce the incidence. Furthermore, the moderate positive correlation between mask use and deaths in Western Europe also suggests that universal use has harmful consequences.”"
2690	17	But a striking comparison work was set out in a recent article from the Brownstone Institute which concluded that masks, whether surgical or cloth, by themselves have no impact on controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. In the article, 167 studies are examined and in the light of which it can certainly be said that the evidence demonstrates that such a device is not only ineffective for the purpose of controlling the virus, but is harmful, especially on children.
2690	19	On what grounds, considered scientific, does the Government still base its directives?
2690	21	"We hope more and more that all the aforementioned studies will be seriously taken into consideration, that we will stop hiding behind the now repeated refrain ""let's protect the fragile"" health measures that are not health, but harmful."
2690	23	We hope that the impact for a child who still has to wear a mask at school will be assessed in its complexity and therefore also from a psychological and educational point of view.
2690	25	Finally, let's hope that people will finally be able to free themselves from this harmful device, which has now become a mere symbol of terror, but in fact useless for the purposes of real, healthy and effective protection.
