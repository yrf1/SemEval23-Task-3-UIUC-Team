2310	1	Macron and ecology, the big parade
2310	3	"In terms of ecology, Emmanuel Macron does not know on which foot to dance. Between the invitation of activist Greta Thunberg to the Elysee Palace and the announcement of the construction of new nuclear reactors, the outgoing president likes to play ""at the same time""."
2310	5	In the beginning was indifference. Before his accession to the Élysée, Emmanuel Macron had not seemed to be interested in questions of the environment, energy, climate, the themes of which were generally absent from his 2017 program. These were the appointment of Nicolas Hulot Minister for the Ecological Transition then the decision to launch a crusade for the planet, after Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreements, which allowed him to put on the costume. A metamorphosis imposed on him by the spirit of the times and the certainty that he could not head for a second term without relying on a “left” leg now more green than pink.
2310	7	From Greta at the Élysée to the promise of new nuclear reactors
2310	9	Also, when Nicolas Hulot resigned in August 2018, there was no question of replacing him with a supporter of heavy industry. The ministry will be entrusted to the ecologist François de Rugy, before falling to Barbara Pompili, notoriously anti-nuclear. The tone remains the same: rage on fossil resources, long live renewables, the end of the world is near, we must change society.
2310	11	"The movement of the ""yellow vests"" which, like a cry of reality, opposed a virulent denial to these obsessions, made the executive tremble but did not divert it from its line of conduct. In February 2019, Emmanuel Macron gave activist Greta Thunberg the honors of the Élysée and, later, the Citizen's Climate Convention, which was intended as a response to ""yellow vests"", resulted in proposals - always more taxes and “ecological” constraints – the exact opposite of the movement's aspirations. A capture of the debate and a democratic travesty that bordered on prestidigitation."
23100	3	Pope Francis. The pope of rupture. The green, anti-capitalist pope, friend of the poor and migrants. The pope benevolent with gays and divorcees, but hostile to traditionalists. The reformer of the corrupt Roman curia, the eradicator of ecclesiastical sexual abuse… Or rather the pope of paradoxes? Indeed, it is with Bayer-Monsanto and BP that François plans to save the environment, with Bank of America and the big names in Big Pharma such as Merck or Johnson & Johnson that he wants to rebuild an ethical capitalism. Would he then above all be the king of a new marketing logic? Indeed, it is precisely in the name of the defense of the environment, inclusiveness or even social justice that the corporate actors (that is to say from the private sector) of global governance have decided to to have their agenda accepted everywhere — which is none other than to grant themselves full powers on the planet.
23100	5	Bergoglio, in this respect, is a textbook case. He chose to make the Vatican a spokesperson for this global governance in the wake of the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF). In fact, the decision-makers of this governance, because they no longer intend to exploit the consumerist quest for happiness of the masses, but rather rely on coercion, have now adopted a marketing strategy that seeks to disguise their thirst for power by displaying a desire to break with neoliberal, individualistic and energy-guzzling capitalism. The global elite accumulates all the goods it still lacks, confiscates public freedoms and concentrates power in its own hands, but it dresses this group in a narrative concerned with ecology, focused on the common good, hostile to individual freedoms and criticism of the free market. The message that François addresses to the world is one of the finest examples of this new communication.
23101	1	The European Union organizes Diversity and Inclusion Month. All to your projects!
23101	3	"""Promoting diversity and inclusion"": this is one of the major projects of the European Commission, which this spring launched the ""European Capitals of Inclusion and Diversity Award"". Its objective: “To see the emergence of a more egalitarian Europe in terms of disability but also of gender, racial and ethnic origin, religion and belief, age, the rights of LGBTIQ people and the integration of Roma. »"
23101	5	It is one of the strands of the European Union Action Plan against Racism 2020-2025. Eight European cities received their prizes with great fanfare on April 28, the preamble to the opening of the European Diversity Month. An initiative that was born in 2020, diversity being celebrated, henceforth, every May until death ensues.
23101	7	"The gold medal went to Cologne, followed by Gothenburg, ""which saw the birth of Greta Thunberg"". This feat therefore deserved a silver medal. The bronze medal went to Barcelona. And France? Nothing. No. We are not diverse and inclusive enough. The city of Arras was, however, one of the 22 pre-selected cities out of the 82 that applied, but we stopped there."
23101	9	Note, in passing: knowing that the European Union has 400 towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants, that the competition was open to agglomerations of at least 50,000 inhabitants and that only 82 towns applied, we can conclude that this did not of little interest to European citizens. However, the Commission did not skimp on the (silly) publicity campaigns.
23101	11	"Already, you should know that the European Union finances “initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion and at fighting against inequalities and discrimination, particularly in the Roma community”. With a budget of €1.55 billion for the period 2021-2027, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values ​​(CERV) program is, we are told, ""the largest EU fund ever devoted to the promotion of rights and values ​​in the EU”."
23101	13	"On paper, it's idyllic. The Commission is teeming with ideas for companies and other associations that have signed the 26 diversity charters ratified by 14,400 organisations. The goal of the May of Diversity is therefore, above all, to ""fight against discrimination through measures that go beyond the legislation currently in place"", so it's up to everyone to their own little idea."
23101	15	"For those who lack it, the European Union offers events and actions to promote its little shop, knowing that a label makes it possible to be referenced on Google Maps, the map, ""taken up at national and European level, thus giving visibility at your event! "" Helena Dalli, European Commissioner for Equality, thus dangles miraculous results: ""By organizing an internal event for or in collaboration with your employees, or an event open to the general public, to your customers and suppliers (sic), you will show your commitment and celebrate diversity while raising awareness among members of your organization. »"
23101	17	"The European Union has therefore issued an “Inspirational guide to celebrate the European month of diversity”. The guideline: “focus on finding connections between the different grounds of discrimination you address in your diversity and inclusion policies and activities, and then engage in actions that address multiple areas of discrimination at times ""."
23101	19	These days, entrepreneurs may have other concerns on their minds!
23101	21	"At random Balthazar, you can have a Frankfurt sausage fair in Toulon and an anchoïade in Wiesbaden; you will then receive ""a message of congratulations once your event has been labeled"" and will be able to retrieve ""the communication kit with the graphic elements of the Joli Mois de l'Europe"" (logos, posters, flyers, banners, etc.). It's nice, isn't it?"
23102	1	In Italy, a historic drought threatens agriculture
23102	3	Severe decrease in snowfall and rain and very high temperatures: northern Italy faces its worst drought in 70 years. As lakes and rivers dry up, agriculture and the energy sector fear the extent of the damage.
23102	5	"Since the heat wave of 2003, the country has experienced ""the six driest years in its history"", recalls Francesco Vincenzi, president of the association of irrigation consortia (Anbi). However, this year is not like the others. Not only for the seriousness of the situation but also for the period in which it occurs. “If, before, we were talking about drought from July 20, now we are on June 23 and we have already been talking about it for at least twenty days”, he is alarmed."
23102	6	Snowfall has fallen by 70% this winter and precipitation by half since December
23102	8	First witness and victim of the tragedy: the Po. This 652 km river, the longest in Italy, crosses the north of the country starting from the Alps, in the west, towards the Adriatic Sea, in the east. An animation made with satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA) compares the state of the river in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The findings are disturbing. We can see the river which is gradually reduced, giving way to ever more extensive sandy beaches. The flow of the Po has decreased so much - up to 80% - that salt water coming from the Adriatic Sea has managed to rise nearly 30 km inland. A risky situation for the supply of drinking water and for agriculture. “We cannot irrigate with salt water, otherwise we burn everything,” explains Francesco Vincenzi. Moreover, the infiltration of salt water means long-term consequences because “it will take years before it disappears from the aquifers”.
23102	10	"North of the river, the great lakes are also visibly drying up. Lake Maggiore would need more than 2,527 million m³ of water to return to its average, according to Anbi, and Lake Como has a filling rate of less than 12%. Moreover, it is these same lakes that partly feed the rivers through a regulation system. ""When we say that the lake is dry, that does not mean that it is empty"", specifies Matteo Cislaghi, hydrologist at the Lombard Agency for the Protection of the Environment (Arpa). Indeed, below a certain level, the water can no longer be released because ""not only would it no longer reach the outlet mouth [of the water reservoir] but in addition, it would kill the lake"", explains the hydrologist ."
23102	12	At the origin of this historic drought: an accumulation of crises. Snowfall has decreased by 70% this winter and precipitation by half since December. The Piedmont region went almost 110 days without a drop of rain. Added to all this are exceptionally high temperatures, sometimes up to 3°C more, causing the early melting of the little snow on the mountain peaks.
23102	14	"Consequences: ""the availability of water does not allow all needs to be met at the environmental, agricultural and industrial levels"", analyzes Massimiliano Pasqui, researcher at the observatory on drought of the Italian National Research Council (CNR)."
23102	15	The farmer realizes the facts: nearly 50% of his corn production is compromised
23102	17	Access to drinking water remains guaranteed, however confirm all the interlocutors contacted. However, hundreds of municipalities across the regions concerned have decided to limit the use of water. In Milan, for example, it is forbidden to fill your swimming pool or to clean your car with a jet. In Piedmont, two municipalities have closed the taps at night, confirms the regional councilor responsible for the environment, Matteo Marnati. “In areas where the aqueducts are older, there are problems with loss. We manage to solve them by bringing water in tank trucks,” he explains.
23102	19	"The sector most affected by this crisis is agriculture. Like all producers in the Po basin, Davide Canegrati now lives ""day to day"", depending on the weather forecast. Tuesday, June 28, the rain was indeed there. If it temporarily relieved the rivers and lakes, it was not enough to fill the water deficit. The farmer realizes the facts: nearly 50% of his corn production is compromised. “Since April, we have been able to irrigate, totally or partially, only 30 hectares out of the 50 where the plant is grown,” he explains. As for its 70 hectares of meadow, they too are dry. This production being used to feed his cows at the end of the season, Davide Canegrati will surely have to choose between reducing his livestock ""by at least 25%"" or buying food elsewhere, despite the soaring prices caused by the Russian invasion in Ukraine."
23102	21	On a larger scale, the entire agriculture of the Po basin is at risk, knowing that it alone produces nearly 40% of Italian food, including flagship products such as parmesan. In Lombardy, wheat yields have already fallen by 30 to 40% in some places, says Ermes Sagula, head of the assistance center at the Coldiretti Lombardy farmers' association. Today, the damage to Italian agriculture is estimated at more than 500 million euros. “Towards the end of the year, we will surely have a figure that exceeds one billion,” he continues.
23102	23	Another production affected by the drought: that of energy. Most hydroelectric plants are idling, or have even been shut down, such as that of Serafini Island, 70 km southeast of Milan. By the end of 2022, we can expect a drop in production of 55% to 60% for large plants and 70% to 75% for small ones, estimates Assoidroelettrica, an industry association. “It is a particularly serious situation knowing that the energy which will not be produced with water will have to be produced with gas, the prices of which are extremely high”, insists Paolo Taglioli, general manager of the association. And whose greenhouse gas emissions will make the problem worse.
23102	25	"""We have the illusion that this resource is infinite when it is not"""
23102	27	"To deal with the crisis, the Po River Basin Authority insists: the withdrawals of available water must be reduced by 20%. Then, the solutions will have to be thought out in the long term because ""the urgency is structural"", recalls Matteo Marnati. Indeed, all indicators show that such episodes will become more frequent. ""Temperatures are rising and our glaciers are shrinking,"" analyzes Orietta Cazzuli, head of the Arpa meteorological service. As for precipitation, ""we have no signs of a decrease"", but it could be less and less regular and more intense."
23102	29	"Proposals are therefore on the table to avoid running out of steam in the future. Matteo Marnati is pushing for the creation of new dams in the Piedmont region, in order to capture more rainwater. With nearly 600 dykes and around fifteen lakes, Lombardy is a region rich in water resources. ""What is needed is better water management,"" said Damiano Sirmine, of the environmental association Legambiente. According to him, regional agriculture, mainly based on rice and corn, particularly water-intensive crops, must adapt. “We have to accept that in this climate change scenario, agriculture will have to modify its production choices,” he continues. To all this, Massimiliano Pasqui adds a cultural change. You have to learn to save water. “We have the illusion that this resource is infinite when it is not. »"
23102	31	Especially since in recent weeks, the drought alarm has also begun to sound in the central regions of the country, such as Tuscany, Marche and Lazio. On Monday, July 4, the government declared a state of emergency in five northern regions and announced the release of a fund of 36.5 million euros to deal with this drought.
23103	1	Covid-19: a France without course or compass in the face of the seventh wave
23103	3	Few prevention messages, no strong measures, all against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty: the management of the pandemic is suffering from the weariness of the French, but also from competition from other crises, while the number of daily cases is falling. rises to 100,000 on average on July 1.
23103	5	No one knows exactly how high it will go. Since the beginning of June, the seventh wave has been spreading in France and the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants are rapidly spreading among the population. The consequences in terms of mortality and on the health system are still limited, but the numbers are soaring and the hospital is more fragile than ever. At the end of last week, the president of the scientific council, Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, estimated, on the antenna of RTL, that tensions could emerge in the hospital system towards the end of July. According to the latest government data, as of July 1, 960 people with Covid-19 are in critical care, with a recovery initiated since June 20. More than 16,000 people are hospitalized, with now nearly a thousand daily admissions. An increase of 31% over the last seven days compared to the previous week. As of July 1, nearly 100,000 new daily cases were reported on average, up nearly 60% from the previous week. The increase is not slowing down.
23106	1	"A ""COP of cities"" to fight against climate change"
23106	3	Talking about climate change means always summoning the latest catastrophic events that we are facing. Think of the heat wave that made India and Pakistan bend recently, think of those that are in the process of affecting Europe, not a month goes by without a signal of alert is issued. Floods, heat waves, fires. Earlier, more intense, more devastating, these episodes remind us more and more of our fragility and the urgency to act.
23106	5	COP 26 in Glasgow did not live up to expectations. Inability to raise the level of ambition, inability to stabilize what is necessary in terms of solidarity with the States of the South, it is to the spectacle of a slow multilateralism that we have been invited.
23106	7	The urgency is there, the threat is getting closer, the IPCC reports leave no escape. Global warming is undoubtedly man-made. Limiting it to 1.5°C can only be envisaged at the cost of rapid and massive changes. The worst is not certain, but success imposes a decarbonization trajectory from which we are still far.
23106	9	To the background noise of this threat, always more muted, is added that of the crises which have invited themselves where they were no longer expected. Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. In too many countries, these crises have led to a preference for what is “here and now”. However, we must continue to embrace the climate issue before it is too late.
23106	11	We need promises kept and resources. We need a systemic response so that climate migration does not lead to more uncontrollable cascading effects. Failure to investigate these issues exposes us to the risk of falling out with vulnerable countries. However, we must stay together, it is humanity that is at stake.
23106	13	Let everyone take their part
23106	15	It is now important to find new balances, first and foremost the construction of a broader multilateralism that allows everyone to play their part.
23106	17	The cities are there, they always have been, even in dark times. They are rolling up their sleeves with the means at their disposal to cope. They invent, they create, they get local actors on board to invent a model of society that takes local resources into account.
23106	19	Cities, including those with the smallest budgets, are full of ideas. Resources are created, sometimes the product of public policies, sometimes of a citizen emergence, carried by informal networks. It is these riches that allow optimism.
23106	21	Today, means are on the table but do not always find their destination. Funding frameworks built on banking logic do not always meet the guarantees that cities are able to offer. Without facing these structural difficulties, it is a group of cities that are kept away from development aid.
23106	23	"Today we need to create the conditions for a broader dialogue, a vector of exchange, justice and attention to the most vulnerable. This is why the ""COP of cities"" will be held on July 1 and 2 in Abidjan around a hundred mayors of cities around the world gathered for the occasion."
23106	25	It will be held on a continent affected like no other by climate change and which only asks for one thing: to put its dynamism, its creativity and its youth at the service of the general interest. You can count on us, the mayors of cities around the world.
23106	27	You can count on our vigilance, on our determination to do everything in our power to change the course of things.
23106	29	The signatories: Anne Hidalgo Mayor of Paris, Robert Beugré Mambé Governor of the Autonomous District of Abidjan, Souad Abderrahim Cheikh El Medina of Tunis, LaToya Cantrell Mayor of New Orleans, Philippe Close Mayor of Brussels, Frank Cownie President of Local Governments for Sustainability (Iclei) and Mayor of the City of Des Moines, USA, Willy Demeyer Mayor of Liège, Franziska Giffey Mayor, Governor of Berlin, Roberto Gualtieri Mayor of Rome, Ron Huldai Mayor of Tel-Aviv-Yafo, Grégoire Junod Syndic of Lausanne, Sadiq Khan Mayor of London and President of C40, Fatimetou Abdel Malick President of the Nouakchott region and President of UCLG-A, Carlos Moedas Mayor of Lisbon, Maxime Prévot Deputy and Mayor of Namur, Rafal Trzaskowski Mayor of Warsaw.
23107	1	The Pride of the suburbs, the queer march of working-class neighborhoods
23107	3	Two years have passed since the first suburban Pride, two years marked by a health and social crisis with appalling consequences. Two more than trying years for us queers, residents of working-class neighborhoods, racialized people, precarious people, undocumented migrants, exiles, disabled people, neuro-atypical, HIV-positive people, sex workers, trans people, non-binaries, those whose identities and expressions are deemed non-conforming. Two years during which we mourned many disappearances within our communities.
23107	5	The presidential election has given way to an ever more devious and corrupt public debate, driven by mounting LGBTQIA+ phobias, Islamophobia and racism. Every day, on TV, on the radio, we are singled out, insulted. Our rights are denied, our dignity is violated. While we are considered monsters, delinquents or even terrorists, the political inaction regarding the emergencies we are experiencing remains. The precariousness that we have always experienced is reinforced by an entrepreneurial management of the crisis, by a resigning government which makes us understand every day its lack of interest in our lives.
23107	7	"We are confronted with poor housing, which concerns almost one person in sixteen, the saturation of food aid, ever more difficult access to the prefecture or public administrations and the intensification of police repression which have always been our daily life (1). As queers, as racialized people, a fear exists every time we want to seek treatment, that health professionals are not trained to take care of. our situations. A fear every time we find ourselves at a counter: ""Will I be taken care of correctly or will I be neglected because of my (or my) identity?""."
23107	9	Overcrowded emergency accommodation services
23107	11	Among all these injustices, this year, we must insist on the strict application of the fundamental right to decent housing. In Seine-Saint-Denis, emergency accommodation services are systematically saturated: 71,011 requests for accommodation expressed were not filled throughout the year, leaving 9,653 people on the street, unassisted (2). We, working-class queers, are overrepresented among these homeless people. Indeed, it is common that, following violence, whether physical, psychological or economic, we are excluded from our homes without having any accommodation solution. However, no reception system is currently up to our needs.
23107	13	The emergency can't wait! No one will fight for us if we LGBTQIA+ people from working-class neighborhoods don't lead the fight on our own. If our allies don't support us! Our belief is that the answers that will restore our dignity are universal. Our struggles will benefit many of our fellows. As Anna Julia Cooper, an illustrious Afro-feminist activist, said: “When they enter, we all enter”, this means that to open the door to us is to open it to everyone (3).
23107	15	Let's be immensely numerous on June 4, 2022 at 2 p.m., Place René-Dumont in Saint-Denis to make our rage heard. To stand up to our sisters, our brothers, our fellows. To assert our rights. Unite under the banner of celebrating individuals and communities! Let's unite to fight exclusion! Let's build together a society in which human dignity is unconditional!

23108	1	In Russia, these untruths as frightening as they are absurd
23108	3	Vladimir Putin may be losing the war in Ukraine, but he is winning his other war, the one in Russia against truth and information. A cloak of lead fell over the country, and an Orwellian system of propaganda was put in place, preceded by the dismantling of all opposition, the closing of all free media, the abolition of all critical association. As a result, on the eve of the commemoration of the Allied victory and the end of the Second World War, many Russians see in the “special operation in Ukraine” a just and justified war. Our report bears witness to this: between the continuous television channels relaying untruths as frightening as they are absurd and the political and military announcements carefully hiding the humiliation of the Russian army in Ukraine, the inhabitants take refuge in a political apathy or , even worse, in a reinforcement of anti-Western prejudices in this part of the world.
23108	5	Sanctions, which are only beginning to be felt, are likely to accentuate this bias. Western pressure is not meant to convince the Russian people to oppose the autocrat who rules them anyway: it was to cut Putin off from his base of support in the economic, military and political elite of Russia. While a grotesque stage play is unfolding in Moscow to compare Ukraine to Nazi Germany, it is still too early to know if these measures will have the desired effect. The number of oligarchs forced to flee, or suddenly deciding to fall out of windows, suggests that Putin has no intention of abandoning the war madness that drives him. This vicious circle demonstrates that it is not only the freedom of the Ukrainian people that is at stake, but indeed that of the Russian people.
23110	1	Russian gas crisis: ecology and democracy are retreating in Germany
23110	3	Because of Russian gas rationing, Germany is relaunching coal and wondering about nuclear power, things that were unthinkable a year ago. Collateral effect of this economic and political reversal: the strengthening of central power in the face of local powers.
23110	5	After Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, France, since June 17, no longer receives Russian gas. If the flow towards Germany, Italy or Austria has been maintained, Gazprom has however reduced the flow by half, in retaliation for the official acceptance by the European Union of the application for entry of Ukraine.
23110	7	"A very heavy blow for Germany, which usually imports 58 million m3 of Russian gas each year, against only 13 for us. Gazprom boss Alexei Miller was clear: “Our product, our rules. We don't play by rules we didn't make."" In France, we are rather quiet: stocks are 56% full, more than usual at this time of year."
23110	9	Conversely, in Germany, the Russian invasion raised awareness of the enormous mistake of collaborating with Putin around the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which Angela Merkel was so proud to have built in 2010, explaining then, faced with to Polish warnings that, even during the Cold War, Russian gas had never stopped arriving…
23110	10	The German U-turn: the return of coal and the nuclear debate
23110	12	The irony is total: it was the ecologist Robert Habeck, Minister for the Economy and the Climate – yes that is his title – who came yesterday to announce to the Germans the passage to level two, out of three, of the plan national gas emergency, involving in particular a more sustained activity of the power stations…. coal, the worst possible mode of energy production.
23110	14	The country's gas stocks do not cover the needs for next winter. The debate is tense because, in German law, families have priority over companies in the event of a lack of fuel. But the specter of recession is already looming. So if the industries, the pillars of the country's economy, have to produce less this winter, it will be cold in the houses, but the social climate is likely to be very hot.
23110	16	"And while, following the accident at the Fukushima plant in 2011, Germany had decided to close all its nuclear power plants, the Minister of Finance, the liberal Christian Lindner, proposed that the last three, which were to close their doors at the end of the year, see their lifespan extended, in order to ""ensure the energy security of the country in the coming years""."
23110	18	The German government brings together a coalition of three parties. Social Democrats and Greens are very anti-nuclear, opposition to this energy being the foundation of German ecology. Conversely, the liberals, relays of employers, are favorable to this energy. Who will win? We do not know.
23110	19	For the Germans, the wind turbines will be by force or by force
23110	21	Another debate is the issue of wind turbines, the development of which is increasingly contested in France. Germany, which already has 3 times more than us, wants to multiply their number by 3 within the next ten years, to cover 2% of its territory with giant blades.
23110	23	There is an effective way to do this: their development has just been legally considered a matter of national security. No more local dialogue and other “impact studies”, to slow down or prevent their construction. This will be imperative. The distances that previously existed between wind turbines and houses, of 800 meters minimum, have been removed.
23110	25	The change is significant in a federal country like Germany, where the federated states have strong powers. For many ecologists, the ecological transition is a chance to reinvigorate democracy, especially at the local level. This is of course partly true.
23110	26	Ecology against local democracy
23110	28	"But the Russian gas crisis, which pales in comparison to the magnitude of the changes that a complete ecological transition to fully renewable energy sources would require, shows that we, the inhabitants of rich countries, are too far behind. to allow time for deliberation and local choices. Robert Habeck thus considers that it was a ""mistake"" not to have built even more wind turbines in the past."
23111	3	"Fabrice Leggeri has just tendered his resignation as executive director of Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency. This resignation comes after months of successive revelations concerning Frontex's involvement in human rights violations, in particular in the context of its operations at the borders of Eastern Europe and in Greece. Having focused my research on the central Mediterranean for more than ten years, these revelations do not surprise me at all. As part of one of the investigations that I carried out within the Forensic Oceanography project (Death by Rescue, 2016), I demonstrated that during the summer of 2014 Frontex carried out a real campaign for the Italian military and humanitarian operation Mare Nostrum is halted. While the operation deployed in 2013-2014 had made it possible to proactively rescue a large number of migrants fleeing Libya in dramatic conditions, Frontex accused it of constituting a ""call for air"" leading to more crossings."
23111	5	In order to dissuade migrants from reaching the European continent, the agency has done everything possible to end the Mare Nostrum operation and replace it with a Frontex operation, Triton , much further from the Libyan coast, and whose objective was border control and not rescue at sea. This operational change was implemented despite the unanimity of actors defending the rights of migrants, and even internal Frontex assessments that predicted that the end of Mare Nostrum would not lead to fewer crossings but more deaths at sea.
23111	7	It is this reality that tragically materialized, in particular with the shipwreck of April 18, 2015, the deadliest in the recent history of the Mediterranean with more than 950 dead. Following this disaster, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, admitted that “it was a serious mistake to end Mare Nostrum. It cost lives” (1). One would have expected that following this recognition, Frontex would be sanctioned for its role in this deadly operational change. Nothing happened: the Frontex operation was reinforced and its budget increased. And the deadly relief void left by the end of Mare Nostrum has never been filled.
23111	9	From disdain to impunity
23111	11	All of this may seem distant. But today, Frontex planes and drones inform the Libyan coast guard of the presence of migrants so that they are intercepted and brought back to Libya, despite everything we know about the inhuman conditions reserved for them. However, this older episode deserves to be remembered because it clearly demonstrates the role of Frontex in the construction of migrants as a threat, the establishment of ever more costly and militarized border control operations, the disdain for the lives and rights of migrants that animates the agency, and the impunity that has been organized around its activities. Despite the public and political pressure to which Frontex is now subject, this state of affairs is not fundamentally called into question, and the departure of Fabrice Leggeri will not significantly change the situation.
23111	13	But there is more. For the past two months, the European Union has been applying a policy of selective openness to migrants fleeing Ukraine. For a (too) limited group of people, a paradigm shift has been made: that of allowing the mobility of people seeking refuge and recognizing their rights rather than seeking to block them at all costs. This open breach makes clear today for the greatest number what has been clear for a long time for many researchers, actors and actresses of civil society: the restrictive and militarized approach of the EU is not a fatality, a more open and rights-respecting policy is possible, and this would make actors like Frontex superfluous.
23111	15	"On May 15, Swiss citizens will vote on the funding of Frontex. This referendum gives the Swiss people an opportunity to stop being complicit with an agency whose increasingly costly activities have never put an end to the ""migration threat"" that Frontex has helped to build, and which are through the violation of migrant rights and thousands of deaths with impunity. A “no” from the Swiss to the financing of Frontex could have a European resonance and contribute not only to a questioning of the agency but to a fundamental reorientation of European migration policies."
23113	1	The United States and the European Union hit Putin right in the wallet
23113	3	United as rarely, the United States and the European Union have taken severe economic restriction measures against Russia. Beyond the effectiveness of these measures, the question is whether the Ukrainian crisis will finally mark the beginning of the end of deregulated finance, the main support of all the mafias and dictatorships of the globe.
23113	5	"The joint communiqué of the European Union and the United States, available here in French, makes it clear: ""The war waged by Russia constitutes an aggression against the fundamental international rules and norms which have prevailed since the Second World War and which we are determined to defend. We will hold Russia to account and we will collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin. »"
23113	7	Faced with Putin, the United States and the EU, itself united for the first time in its short history, unleashed heavy economic artillery: exclusion of certain Russian banks from global SWIFT messaging; freezing of the assets of the Russian Central Bank; and end to the “golden passports”, these passports a little too easily sold – yes – by certain States, including Malta and especially the United Kingdom, to Russian oligarchs in exchange for investments on the spot.
23113	9	SWIFT: the line is cut
23113	11	"Referred to as “the financial nuclear weapon” by Bruno Le Maire, the SWIFT network is the means by which the banks of the planet send transfer orders to each other. Created in 1977 to replace the telex, SWIFT (acronym for ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", and which means ""prompt"" in English), a private company located in Belgium, is the banks' notary: any message sent on it has value of contract. Indeed, even today, settlements between banks around the world can take days. But decisions are instantaneous. SWIFT then keeps each bank accountable in front of the others for the transfer orders it has placed: if this has been written on SWIFT, it will be necessary to pay."
23113	13	And no bank in the world, not even the Bank of America or Goldman Sachs, as the 2008 crisis proved, can betray its word without being immediately excluded from the global game. The idea of ​​depriving Russian banks of access to the network is therefore excellent. Germany, initially opposed because it feared it would no longer be able to pay for its Russian gas, and which feared more widely disruptions in world trade on which it is so dependent, but which found itself isolated following the release of Austria and of Italy, joined the joint decision.
23113	15	One of the major lessons of the Ukrainian crisis is the reversal of Germany which, for the first time, put the interests of the European Union before its own. It has also just significantly increased its defense budget, after having left France alone to defend Europe against Islamic terrorism in Mali and in many other places where French soldiers have lost their lives.
23113	16	A powerless Russian central bank?
23113	18	Of all the crazy events at the moment, the crippling of Russian Central Bank action is arguably the most astonishing. The decision by the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom to prohibit the Russian Central Bank from using its euros and dollars will have the effect of prevent defending the rouble, the course of which has already fallen sharply.
23113	20	Indeed, to defend your currency, you have to buy it. And to buy it, you need foreign currency, euros or dollars: the Central Bank of Russia cannot buy rubles with rubles. Its currency will therefore collapse in the coming days – and this all the more so as the holders of rubles now know that it cannot defend it. However, with a falling rouble, it is the prices of imported products that immediately increase, arousing the discontent of the population. Politically, it is undoubtedly very well played on the part of Westerners.
23113	22	In addition, the Russian Central Bank will also not be able to use its currencies to support its banks, which, deprived of access to the Swift network, will be weakened. The pressure put on the Russian banking system is therefore maximum. It lowers Russia to the level of very few countries in the world, such as Iran, Venezuela or North Korea, real pariahs of the international system with whom no one wants to trade (legally).
23113	23	Oligarchs go home?
23113	25	One of the most delirious financial practices of recent years has been the fact, by several countries, of selling their passports to the highest bidder, in return for investments in their country. The practice was launched by Malta in 2014, allowing all traffickers in the world to move freely within the EU, of which Malta is a member. Something so serious there that it probably cost the life of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist murdered in 2017 in a car bomb attack and who had the very bad idea to take an interest in the subject.
23113	27	But it was London that generalized the practice, to the point of being renamed “Londongrad”. Because the United Kingdom is not only the country that invented mint mutton. It is also one of the largest tax havens in the world, along with the Virgin Islands or the Isle of Man. And they are proud of it, these assholes. Finally, were. Boris Johnson froze the assets of three close associates of Vladimir Putin: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg, and banned them from entering British territory.
23113	29	But the awakening is very late in a country described as a “global hub for money laundering” by the association Transparency International, where even the conservative party, that of Johnson, receives tons of rubles from the rich Russians. The British government itself estimates that £100 billion of corrupt money has entered the country. In Parliament, there is official talk of closing the dirty money laundering “laundry” that London would have become…
23113	30	Tax havens, hell of humanity
23113	32	In short, fortunately Vladimir forced Boris to open his eyes. The whole question is to what extent Russia anticipated all this. And how effective the sanctions will be, and when. The future will tell us in the days and weeks to come.
23114	3	Studies published on Tuesday by Insee and Ined point to both the integration of immigrants into French society but also the obstacles to it, including for the second generations. There are still profound inequalities in access to the labor market.
23114	5	"""First, second, third generation, we are all children of immigrants"", says a slogan launched in the 1980s and which still punctuates anti-racist demonstrations today. Not all of them, but a lot anyway. This is what emerges from a series of studies published on Tuesday which confirm the diversity of the French population."
23114	7	"INSEE and INED worked on the results of their new “Trajectories and origins” survey, carried out between July 2019 and November 2020, some ten years after the first. This second edition, during which nearly 30,000 people of all origins, geographical, national and religious, were interviewed, underlines the ""mixed ancestry"", in the words of Jérôme Lê, head of the immigration studies and statistics unit. ."
23114	9	Mixed unions
23114	11	A third of the French population under 60 has immigrant origins: 9% were born outside France and of foreign nationality, 12% have at least one immigrant parent and 10% have at least one grandparent. foreigner who came to France. With a distribution of origin which reflects the successive strata of immigration, therefore a persistent predominance of European origins which is accompanied by an increase in African origins among the youngest, for the second and third generations.
23114	13	The survey also confirms the integration at work via the diversity of unions over the generations. One out of two second-generation people questioned during the “trajectories and territories” survey comes from a mixed couple and 90% of the third generation have only one immigrant grandparent, while 27% of immigrants and two-thirds of the descendants of immigrants live with a spouse who is neither a foreigner nor a child of a foreigner.
23114	15	School lift
23114	17	Insee and INED studies also confirm that the social ladder works, at least at school level. If immigrants are much less educated than their compatriots born in France, the gap narrows from the second generation. Among natives (fourth generation and over), 43% of children have a higher education diploma, compared to 20% of their parents. For the children of mixed couples and the grandchildren of immigrants, the proportions are identical.
23114	19	"For children whose two parents are immigrants, the step taken is higher since only 5% of the parents have a higher education diploma. But if ""the differences are reduced, they do not disappear"", notes Mathieu Ichou of INED. 33% of children of immigrants have a higher education diploma, with strong differences according to the origin of their parents: Asian and African parents outside the Maghreb are much more educated than those from the Maghreb and southern Europe (22 % and 28% versus 2% and 3%); the same goes for their children (50% and 54% versus 32% and 31%)."
23114	21	Deep inequalities in the labor market
23114	23	But while INSEE has already shown that immigrants are more exposed to the risk of unemployment, the survey also highlights the existence of deep inequalities in access to the labor market. The proportion of grandchildren of European immigrants with higher education qualifications belonging to intermediate or higher professions is certainly equivalent to that of descendants of French natives (75% against 77%). On the other hand, those born to at least one non-European parent are much less likely to be able to value their diploma in this way (63% of North African origin, 67% of Asian origin and 71% from the rest of Africa).
23114	25	"This is related to the issue of discrimination based on origin, nationality or skin color. What is the share of an increase in sensitivity on the subject and of their increase? The work of INSEE and INED does not say so, but they show a very strong increase in their perception in ""the current context of French society"", according to Patrick Simon of INED."
23114	27	At the end of the 2000s, 8% of people with immigrant ancestry claimed to have been victims, compared to 21% ten years later. This is accompanied by a sharp increase in the reporting by people declaring themselves to be of the Muslim faith of discrimination linked to their religion, mentioned by 11% of them against 2% in 2008-2009.
23114	29	Leila de Comarmond
23115	1	Covid: the pandemic responsible for 13 to 17 million deaths, according to the WHO
23115	3	The figures published by the World Health Organization, which take into account the deaths caused directly and indirectly by the Covid, raise the estimates of excess mortality of the States considerably. About 6 in 10 Covid-related deaths were not recorded as such, according to the organization.
23115	5	One in 500 humans, or between 13 and 17 million people. According to new estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) published on Thursday, the number of deaths linked, directly or indirectly, to Covid, is much higher than the number of deaths officially recorded in the world. Highly anticipated, these figures give a more realistic idea of ​​the devastating effects of the worst pandemic in a century and which continues to claim thousands of lives every week.
23115	7	“The total death toll associated directly or indirectly with the Covid-19 pandemic between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 is approximately 14.9 million deaths (a range of 13.3 to 16.6 million)”, revealed the organization. Since the start of the pandemic, official figures from member countries compiled by the WHO come to a total of 5.4 million deaths over the same period, but the WHO has long warned that this statistic underestimates the reality.
23115	9	The WHO says most excess deaths (84%) are concentrated in Southeast Asia (including India), Europe (which includes Russia and other countries of the former USSR) and Americas. Some 10 countries alone account for 68% of the total excess mortality: in descending order, these are Brazil, Egypt, India - which strongly contests the WHO figures much more higher than its official figures - Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the United States.
23115	11	building more resilient health systems
23115	13	“These sobering data underscore not only the impact of the pandemic, but also the need for all countries to invest in more resilient health systems capable of sustaining essential health services during crises, including including stronger health information systems,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
23115	15	In fact, these figures suffer from holes in the statistics, the collection of data being sometimes fragmented or even completely non-existent for certain countries. The ranges given sometimes go from simple to double. The Organization thus estimates that 6 out of 10 deaths are not recorded worldwide.
23115	17	Excess mortality is calculated by taking the difference between the actual number of deaths and the number of deaths estimated in the absence of a pandemic, based on existing statistics. The indirect causes can be due in particular to overloaded health structures and forced, for example, to delay surgical procedures or chemotherapy sessions for cancer patients. Sometimes, confinements have also avoided deaths, such as traffic accidents.
23115	18	politically sensitive topic
23115	20	"""Measuring excess mortality is an essential component for understanding the impact of the pandemic"", explained Samira Asma, in charge of the file at the WHO. More reliable information allows decision makers to better prepare the ground to limit the impact of future crises. ""These new estimates are based on the best available data produced using a robust methodology and a completely transparent approach,"" she said."
23117	3	Question asked by Joseph, June 27
23117	5	"The US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe w. Wade, guaranteeing access to abortion, had repercussions in France. Faced with fears of a decline in the right to abortion, the deputies of the presidential majority tabled a bill on Sunday to include voluntary termination of pregnancy (IVG) in the Constitution. The position of the National Rally (RN), which has long been ambivalent on the subject, raises questions, as 89 of its deputies have been elected to the National Assembly. Invited on Wednesday on France Info, Marine Le Pen estimated that “no significant party questions access to abortion for women”, adding that the inclusion of this right in the Constitution amounted to “a diversion Politics"". Same story on the side of the president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, who wrote on Twitter on Saturday: “No serious political movement calls into question the Veil law in France, acquired to be protected.”"
23117	7	Several elected members of the far-right party have nevertheless assumed “pro-life” positions in the past, such as the new RN deputy from Var, Laure Lavalette, whom we mentioned in a previous article. More recently, publications concerning the organization of an anti-abortion conference by an RN deputy have resurfaced on social networks, and you ask us if it took place at the Palais-Bourbon.
23117	9	Revealed on Twitter, in December 2017 by LREM MP Marie-Pierre Rixain, a conference led by right-wing and far-right anti-abortion personalities was actually held at the National Assembly in January 2018, as the evoked Liberation. At the origin of this event, Marie-France Lorho, far-right deputy for the 4th constituency of Vaucluse, who succeeded the mayor of Orange, Jacques Bompard (Ligue du Sud). She was re-elected in the 2022 legislative elections, with the support of the National Rally and Reconquête.
23117	11	Controversial Colloquium
23117	13	"On Marie-France Lorho's blog, CheckNews found the presentation of the January 17, 2018 event, entitled ""the third day for life"", with the theme ""Confronting transhumanism"". “This day is part of a political struggle for the preservation of life from its beginning to its natural end”, then detailed the MP."
23117	15	"His predecessor Jacques Bompard had launched this day, organized on the eve of ""The march for life"", which takes place in Paris every year in January, since 2005, and where the associations opposed to the right to abortion parade. “To the demagogue postures of elected officials affirming that the “sanctuarisation of contraception and the non-questioning of abortion” must be defended, to the militant vindictiveness of deputies affirming that it cannot be given life to conceived children “ outside the parental project"", must be remembered that it is not the responsibility of the officers of the Palais-Bourbon as party flatterers to interfere in family homes"", he advanced on his website in January 2017, in promotion of the event. It should also be noted that a first edition of the ""parliamentary day for life"", in 2016, was filmed and broadcast on the social network Périscope, in particular a round table on the theme ""abortion: State of emergency"" ."
23117	17	Among the subjects on the program in 2018: “What is a man?” “What is transhumanism?” or even “Surviving transhumanism”. To discuss it, representatives of associations such as Choosing Life, Catholic Riposte or Action Française, with clearly anti-abortion positions. But also political figures, such as Jean-Frédéric Poisson, former deputy of the Christian Democratic Party, and others from the extreme Catholic right, such as Guillaume de Prémare, first president of the Manif pour tous, or Guillaume de Thieulloy, director of the traditionalist Catholic blog “le Salon beige”.
23117	19	Authorized practice
23117	21	"The holding of this symposium had caused reactions, even to the President of the National Assembly, in the person, at the time, of François de Rugy. The latter had urged the far-right MP to remove the institution's logo from the invitation card, reported France Info. ""The use of the logo of the National Assembly to promote militant colloquia organized by deputies has created confusion"", he also said on Twitter, adding that ""the institution cannot be committed by these initiatives"". François de Rugy then asked for a clarification of the rules concerning the use of the logo."
23117	23	Associations such as Inter-LGBT, Family Planning or SOS Homophobia had also demonstrated in front of the gates of the institution on the day of the conference, judging “very shocking” its holding in the premises of the Assembly.
23117	25	"Colloquia on various subjects are regularly organized at the National Assembly by elected officials. The entourage of the President of the Palais-Bourbon also specified to France Info, at the time of the controversy, that ""as long as we remain within the framework fixed by law"", the Assembly ""has no right of scrutiny"" on the meetings fixed by the deputies. The following year, in June 2019, Marie-France Lorho thus renewed the organization of the “parliamentary day for life”, with the theme “GPA-Transhumanism-Eugenism”, on the eve of the “revision of bioethical laws “, we find on his Twitter account. And with, again, the logo of the National Assembly. More recently, she also opposed the extension from 12 to 14 weeks of the period for recourse to abortion, a flagship measure of the law of March 2, 2022, aimed at strengthening the right to abortion."
23118	1	Vladimir Putin forced to appeal to an autocrat bigger than him
23118	3	Can you imagine Tsar Peter the Great asking for help in his war against the King of Sweden? Can you imagine Emperor Alexander I begging for arms from the Turks to be able to enter Paris? Did Stalin need China's endorsement to defeat Hitler? Vladimir Putin is decidedly poor compared to the three figures of Russian history that he had adopted as models. According to estimates by international credit agencies, Russia could declare bankruptcy in mid-April, like a vulgar banana republic that has run out of bananas.
23118	5	And if the President of the Russian Federation is not above financial maneuvers to deny the obvious, such as contesting the bill, recalculating his debts, confiscating the assets of Westerners who did not sell their branches in time in Moscow and others, he will not be able to push back the deadline by more than two, three weeks. There is therefore still time to appeal to another autocrat, much more powerful and wealthy than him: Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
23118	7	But the People's Republic of China did not become the second largest economy in the world by taking part in a war that does not concern it, or any other for that matter. Beijing has no interest in abandoning the ambiguity and facade of neutrality that have served it so well, and it is unlikely that Jinping will agree to provide military or even logistical support to its cumbersome Russian ally. And Moscow's plight can only find a partial answer in indirect financial support from Beijing, such as increased wheat and energy purchases.
23118	9	"Can this be enough, and for how long? One of Putin's closest oligarchs, Vladimir Potanin, said on Monday he feared ""a return to the past 100 years, to 1917"". 1917, the year of the terrible collapse of the Russian economy in the face of civil war, now hovers above Moscow."
23120	1	Refugees: France regains its sense of welcome, permanent reversal or mirage?
23120	3	"It took a war and thousands of civilian deaths at the gates of Europe for that. Why ? So that Robert Ménard expresses remorse after the abject headlines of the Béziers newspaper and the displays of his city, for years, about the Syrians. ""There are not two kinds of victims: there are not Christian Europeans who should be defended and then people in the Middle East who are Muslims and who we would have been right not to accept in our country. “, declared the support of Marine Le Pen. Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, he is a humanist."
23120	5	It was therefore necessary for more than 2.5 million people to leave their country at war in order for the remarks of right-wing and far-right candidates to disappear from the presidential campaign, giving the impression that France is a country ruined by uncontrolled migratory flows. . Exit the “there are too many immigrants in France” by Valérie Pécresse. Now refugees and solidarity have replaced migrants and hatred in all minds, even the most narrow. Only Eric Zemmour seems to persist in his crass stupidity.
23120	7	There is no reason to rejoice in a war. Really none, let's insist on that. But Robert Ménard is not the only convert. The challenge is broader than that. There is something comforting in seeing Europe regain a sense of welcome. Calais find accommodation places for those waiting to reach England. To see the French mobilize. To make donations. Going so far as to rent empty Airbnbs in Kyiv (kyiv) so that the money goes to the families. Create citizen convoys to bring and welcome Ukrainians home. Until now, With open arms was a bad fiction with Christian Clavier. Now it's a little more than that. Let's hope this change is lasting and unconditional. Let more humanity be expressed to all refugees.
23121	1	Peace and climate, the same fight
23121	3	For fifty years, the environmental movement has affirmed that the climate issue is intimately linked to geopolitical issues, and therefore to peace and its stability. As Russia has invaded Ukraine and the IPCC has just published an alarming new report, it has never been clearer: scientists find that the impacts of climate change are faster, more violent and claim more victims provided that. Half of humanity now finds itself in a situation of extreme vulnerability to climate change. Not only do climatic disasters (droughts, floods, storms, fires) upset global balances and cause tensions at all levels (forced displacements, increased competition for resources, armed conflicts), but also our absolute dependence on fossil fuels and to the States which supply them in the globalized economy provokes and aggravates this infernal spiral.
23121	5	Since we live in societies closely dependent on fossil fuels, these are constantly liable to descend into conflict. The war in Ukraine also foreshadows what a world of plus 2°C and beyond could look like, if we do not begin this transition now. Breaking free from this dependence on fossil resources means moving towards a more stable and peaceful world.
23121	7	Gold in the hands of Putin
23121	9	In the case of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, nothing could be more flagrant. The capital funding Russia's military attack is directly tied to the profits accrued for years by the Kremlin and its oil and gas industry. Indeed, the Russian economy is largely based on the export of oil and gas, since 40% of the federal budget comes from this industry. French multinationals like TotalEnergies and Crédit Agricole are directly concerned: these names are still closely associated with the Russian fossil industry. This is how these companies have put gold (and therefore weapons) into Putin's hands for far too long.
23121	11	The European Union is now Russia's largest customer, spending 100 billion euros a year on Russian oil and gas combined. Gas represents a quarter of the energy consumed in Europe and 40% of this gas is imported from Russia. Whether Putin decides to cut the floodgates to the European Union, or whether the latter takes short-term measures on its own to limit its supply of Russian hydrocarbons (as the United States has done), it is more than likely that our access to these resources will be impacted. The consequences are already being felt on the price of energy for households, in a phase where the price of fuel has already exceeded 2 euros per liter at the pump and where gas could suffer yet another increase (17% of gas consumed in France comes from Russia). It is therefore this dependence that makes the outcome of the conflict even more complex: it also weakens the balance of power and fuels the social crisis.
23121	13	Threat of nuclear weapon
23121	15	In such a configuration, it is difficult to envisage any scenario of lasting peace in Europe, while global warming is accelerating, fossil resources are dwindling and consumption is increasing. To ward off war, we must get out of fossil fuels and false solutions like nuclear power. We refuse, moreover, any desire to take advantage of the current crisis to argue in favor of this extremely costly and dangerous energy, even though the threat of the use of nuclear weapons is increasingly real and the maneuvers of the Russian troops are raising concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants, particularly at Chernobyl and Zaporizhia, the largest in Europe.
23121	17	Today, in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, peace protesters in Russia, and all the victims of this war, we call for a general ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Likewise, we call for refugees to be welcomed into the European Union, without exception or discrimination.
23121	19	We must, more than ever, prepare the necessary break towards sobriety and energy autonomy for European countries, in the hands of communities and citizens.
23121	21	For the climate and for peace, let's march on Saturday March 12 everywhere in France.
23122	1	"Donald Trump to Eric Zemmour: ""Macron is a nice guy"""
23122	3	Donald Trump spoke by telephone with far-right candidate Eric Zemmour. The former president refused to formally support him.
23122	5	Monday, February 14, Donald Trump spoke by telephone with Eric Zemmour. As reported by BFMTV, the far-right candidate of the Reconquest party! will have benefited from a call, but not from his support. The former president of the United States has not formally called to vote for him.
23122	7	"According to a witness to the telephone interview, D. Trump told his interlocutor that ""Macron is a nice guy"" (""Macron is a nice guy""), according to comments reported by the newspaper Le Parisien, and confirmed by the channel on Tuesday."
23122	9	Eric Zemmour's spokesperson, Guillaume Peltier, spoke about this telephone interview during his appearance on France 2 on Monday.
23122	11	"According to him, the former American president would have given advice to the far-right candidate during this exchange of about forty minutes. ""To win, never change your line. Don't give in,"" Trump told him. The latter also recommended that he never change if he wants to win. ""The media will find you brutal. Never change if you want to win.

23123	1	Hand of the state everywhere, justice and reality nowhere
23123	3	I'm going back to what I was saying a few articles ago about inflation, which we see briskly rising again today: if it were only a purely cyclical setback, resulting solely from the bottlenecks of chokeholds that have formed in the supply chain as a result of the sudden restart of activities after the covid pandemic and now because of the Russian war in Ukraine and the confinements in China, central banks would not need any s worry about it.
23123	5	However, they have been concerned about this (for several months, well before the start of the war in Ukraine) and some have even begun to act by ceasing their asset purchases – the famous quantitative easings – and by raising their key rates quite significantly. Typical behavior of central banks beginning to find that the volume of money in circulation has reached an excessively dangerous point relative to the volume of the real economy in the sense that the value of money is now eroding in runaway inflation. So it's time for them to put an end to easy money.
23123	7	The problem, the only problem basically, is that this excessive monetary volume is itself the result of monetary policies decided previously by the same experts. At one time, it was necessary to help growth, both by keeping interest rates low in order to facilitate investments and both by buying back assets in order to lighten the banks' balance sheets and allow them to lend without impediments to states and businesses.
23123	9	"Has growth found its way there? It is enough to look at France to understand that this kind of unbridled policy plays against prosperity and employment. This did not prevent our government, admirably led by Bruno Le Maire, from increasing the public debt by 89 billion euros in the first quarter of 2022, bringing it to 2,900 billion or 114.5% of GDP. The ""whatever it takes"" continues to be more beautiful. It relieves at the time, while fueling the inflation that we want to eradicate."
23123	11	In other words, our executive and monetary authorities are no more and no less trying to correct the failures of their previous decisions. And it is more than likely that by tightening the investment conditions, the new decisions will ultimately have a perfectly negative effect on economic activity and that it will again be necessary to rectify the situation. Vicious circle.
23123	13	Economic activity is not a long calm river. Even without talking about covid or war, a thousand and one small or large external shocks disrupt, sometimes severely, the cruising speed – technological developments, spring fashion, more or less favorable weather, new societal situation, new regulations, etc. But historical observation tends to show that state interventionism, often demanded by the citizens and granted by the authorities in the name of social justice to correct what is wrong with the free play of the market, in reality has the effect of prolong crises, if not aggravate them.
23123	15	Typical example given by Jacques Rueff: when there is a temporary surplus of wheat, which lowers prices and should encourage farmers to adjust their wheat production downwards (“natural” exit from the crisis by the price mechanism), the public authorities generally hasten to come to their rescue by fixing a minimum price which can certainly give the illusion that their incomes are safeguarded, but which on the contrary maintains production at its surplus level and postpones the end of the crisis.
23123	17	Concrete example experienced by France: at the start of 2020, it entered the Covid-19 pandemic without fully recovering from the 2008 crisis. Despite public spending and top-notch redistribution, its unemployment remained curiously higher than among its neighbors the best performers, its more deteriorated public accounts and its still sluggish growth.
23123	19	The inability of the hand of the state to bring about a better world is not limited to the economic field and monetary inflation. There are other inflations, just as illusory, just as unjust and just as much driven by a state desire to redress the disturbing realities of the world. Emblematic example: the almost perpetual increase in the marks of the Bac and the dizzying inflation of the mentions.
23123	21	"We know the stages of the terrifying descent into hell of our education system. At the start, as often, a good intention: in 1985, Jean-Pierre Chevènement gave France the objective of bringing ""80% of an age group to baccalaureate level by 2000"" - a rate largely exceeded today."
23123	23	In the minister's mind, it was most certainly about improving the system, not killing it. But very concretely, it very quickly turned out that it was impossible to achieve the goal from above. Helping pedagogical ideology, it was necessary on the contrary to permanently lower the requirements. As a result, France's place is steadily declining in international rankings, while the Bac pass rate continues to increase and is now around 95%.
23123	25	"The school discontinuity of the covid period and the consequent promises of ""benevolent"" grading have passed by, but the ""harmonization"" of grades, always on the rise, has long been one of the most effective ingredients for giving the illusion of an academic excellence which evaporates more and more."
23123	27	This system has become so institutionalized – to understand: has moved so far from reality – that this year, a year in principle “normal”, without covid, the teachers correcting the copies of the Bac specialty exams had the surprise to note that the harmonization had been done directly in the grade transmission software, in a purely statistical way, without anyone bothering to re-read the actual work of the candidates to verify the legitimacy of raising the average of batches integers of copies of two points or more.
23123	29	In other words, France has reached a point where the marks of the Bac are the exclusive discretionary competence of the State and where the results of the Bac have become a given of pure political propaganda without any relation to the (very different) reality of the level. educative. It is difficult not to see in this system the typical behavior of a failed socialist regime: arranging reality by fiddling with figures and “benevolence” in speech rather than by a change – difficult certainly, but radical and essential. – heading.
23123	31	For students, nothing could be more misleading. Because beyond high school, higher education (at least some of them) and then the job market will be responsible for selecting young people based on their real knowledge and skills. For some, the return to real life is likely to be absolutely terrible.
23123	33	"Nothing is more unfair too. Because even if the collapse of the educational level affects everyone, the good and the excellent students have not completely disappeared. But the delights of ""harmonization"" combined with criteria for access to high schools which favor the student's social coefficient (college of origin, scholarship, etc.) and which aim to ""smooth"" the results no longer allow the best to distinguish themselves."
23123	35	The teachers of the Lycées Louis-Le-Grand and Henri-IV recently echoed sorry about this system which distributes the Bac and the mentions in spades, but which is in fact designed to crush true excellence - a sad way of the sickly egalitarian spirit of France to consider equality. In the Affelnet software for assigning students to second class, software that their establishment is asked to join without flinching at the start of the next school year at the expense of specific recruitment on file, student by student:
23123	37	The student's marks are modified, so as to introduce a 'simplified mark'. For example, a student with between 15 and 20 will have a simplified mark equal to 16 (we cannot therefore notice exceptional qualities).
23123	39	After more than 75 years of welfare state, after more than 75 years of dogmatic and satisfied speeches on the moral superiority of the collective and planned management of everything, France should be in every way a paradise on Earth.
23123	41	And yet, there is nothing. France, on the contrary, has become the country of all erosions built on illusion; the erosion-illusions of its currency – it is not the only one concerned, but it is the most ill-prepared and the least determined to change course – the educational and cultural erosion-illusion, as we have just seen, to which we can easily add the erosion-illusion of its health and pension systems as well as that of the security of goods and people.
23123	43	Isn't it time to give the famous kick to the bottom of the pool?
23124	1	The plague of corruption: This rampant corruption is here to hide scientific truths from the public
23124	3	“This rampant corruption is there to hide scientific truths from the public” (Pr. Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize, about this book).
23124	5	"Dr. Judy Mikovits, virologist, graduate in molecular biology (University of Virginia and George Washington University), has been fighting for years against multinational pharmaceutical companies. In this book which became an instant success in the United States, she denounces the collusion of doctors, laboratories and governments which she accuses of cheating to better sell their vaccines and drugs as expensive as possible, even when they are ineffective. . The world of large laboratories turned against Judy Mikovits when she began to denounce the use of animal tissues in drug research that ended up triggering new waves of chronic diseases, such as autism or chronic fatigue syndrome. She recounts here all the cheating and corruption she has observed during her 35-year career with Dr. Ruscetti (one of the founders of the field of human retrovirology), and what she has seen in private laboratories and public. This is a devastating chronology which is illustrated for example by the war that the media and the doctors (paid by the big laboratories) are waging against Professor Didier Raoult and his medicine which not only cures the vast majority of patients with Covid19, but especially for a few small euros. Which is not to the taste of these same big pharmaceutical companies. At the time of the pandemic which obliges the world population to wear masks for a virus coming from a laboratory, the reading of this book is vital, as recommended by the Professor Luc Montagnier, because it allows the reader to become aware of what is happening behind the curtains of these large laboratories. “”This book reveals the corruption of a part of the scientific world which goes against the economic interests of multinationals”” Dr. Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize winner “”Bill Gates, Big Pharma and the Minister of Health do not want not that you read this book.

23125	1	Trump/Clinton 2016, Le Pen/Macron 2022, similarities, dissimilarities
23125	3	At first glance, the parallels between the 2016 American presidential election and the one taking place this April in France are striking:
23125	5	- In both countries, the presidential function is placed at the center of debates and institutions.
23125	7	- If the USA is among the major world powers, France is at the heart of the EU, one of the six founding States, capable of making it evolve positively or negatively.
23125	9	- The two elections therefore present major global challenges.
23125	11	"- In both cases, candidates perceived as representatives of the ""elite"" of the capital (Hillary Clinton, Emmanuel Macron) clashed and clashed with challengers presenting themselves as spokespersons for populations excluded from the feast of the rich (Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen)."
23125	13	"- In both cases, the former thought they would win because they had the right reason for them, and in both cases the challengers succeeded in bringing together a good part of the ""excluded"" under a sovereigntist and preferably national banner."
23125	15	- In both cases, Putin's Russia made its preferences clear and intervened directly.
23125	17	“Before it was better”
23125	19	"In both cases, finally, we note, after years of media bombardment, particularly on so-called social networks, a clear shift of the electoral cursor to the right. The populist candidate recovering the fears of the working class of being in competition with people poorer than them and of no longer recognizing their country as it was ""before"" (before the arrival of large numbers of migrants, before the dissolution of mores and insecurity in the neighbourhoods, etc.), fears resulting from the seizure of the social ladder and signs of loss of confidence in “progress”. The “elite” candidate is therefore also more to the right, especially in economic matters. And if Trump solicited the crowds with his Make America Great Again, the Lepenist speech does not say anything else, by recycling the image of the sweet France of the prosperous villages of yesteryear, grouped around the school, the town hall and the bell tower – who had Mitterrand elected 40 years ago."
23125	21	The risk ? That demagogy, versatility, insults, excesses and permanent walkabouts take over a discourse of responsibility, as Trump, Salvini or Orban have sadly illustrated throughout their mandates. But above all, and this explains all of Putin's solicitude for the European sovereigntist extreme right, that of a notable weakening of the EU.
23125	23	A key issue: consolidating or destabilizing the EU?
23125	25	The war waged by Putin against Ukraine has clearly underlined the vital importance for the peoples of Europe that the EU be solid and united, if they value their sovereignty and their freedom. Because sovereignty can now only be exercised together, if we want to influence the world. We must therefore be able to count on each other in Europe, and, whoever the next American president is, he must above all take care of the Pacific much more than the Atlantic. Indeed, sooner or later China will take action against Taiwan, which demonstrates on a daily basis what is intolerable for Xi Jinping, namely that democracy is perfectly compatible with the Chinese mentality – and then it will be the moment of truth. for America.
23125	27	The French presidential election – like those of 2016 and 2020 in America – therefore has a geopolitical dimension of the first order. This is where we measure the extent to which, in his self-assurance and his superb, Macron has neglected to arouse the support of the French. He unflinchingly assumed the deleterious label of president of the rich, limiting wealth tax to land and wanting to increase the retirement age, ignored the state of social dilapidation of his country, concealed the tragedies of the territories which become deserted and the suburbs – factories of exclusion and extremism left to their own devices. He was unable to seize the crisis of the yellow vests to decentralize power and introduce elements of direct democracy, nor the proposals of the citizens' convention for the climate, betraying in passing his promise to take them up in full.
23125	29	Neglecting the link with the population is costly
23125	31	He thus seriously weakened his position. But beyond all the parallels between Trump and Marine Le Pen, there is a major difference between the two methods of election: that in France is simple and direct; the candidate with the most votes is elected. In the United States, the electoral system meant that Hillary had 3 million more votes than Trump, but still lost. It took Biden a differential of 8 million votes in his favor to win. We therefore wish France and Europe that Macron achieves a positive result, and hope that the memory of the cannonball will remind him of the need to cultivate the ecological, social and governance dimensions, so that France can finally be at peace. with herself.
23126	1	Greece. Illegal immigration: Athens will triple the length of its fence on the Turkish border
23126	3	While the pressure of illegal flows on its borders is again very strong, Greece has decided to triple the length of its fence along the Turkish border. But will probably have to do without help from Brussels to finance the project.
23126	5	Greece: 80 km of additional fence against Turkey
23126	7	Faced with the pressure of illegal immigration from outside Europe, erecting walls and fences seems more effective than long speeches. This is essentially the policy of Greece, which now plans to triple the length of the fence on its border with Turkey due to a sudden increase in the number of illegal immigrants trying to enter the country.
23126	9	If the announcement of these constructions had been made on May 29 by the Greek authorities, the project has been even more topical in recent days while the influx of migrants at the Greek borders is more and more worrying.
23126	11	Thus, Athens plans, according to the Greek Minister of Immigration and Asylum Notis Mitarachi, to add an additional 80 kilometers of barbed wire and steel to its 40 kilometer fence to reach 120 kilometers. “There is a clear attempt by Turkey to instrumentalize migrants to create a crisis with Greece,” Mitarachi said. “The numbers speak for themselves,” he added.
23126	13	It should be remembered that the issue of immigration is one of the many sensitive issues at the heart of the degraded diplomatic relations between Turkey and Greece. Athens frequently accuses Ankara of weaponizing asylum-seeking migrants at its borders with Greece, saying it is obliged to prevent migrants from entering Greece illegally under an EU-Turkey deal representing billions of euros.
23126	15	Last year, the Greek government completed a 26-kilometre extension of a steel border wall, which increased the length of the barrier to 40 kilometres. For its part, Turkey accuses Greece of pushing back migrants in the Aegean Sea.
23126	17	Reinforcement of staff and migratory pressure
23126	19	Compared to 2021, the number of migrants trying to illegally cross the border between Turkey and Greece is said to have increased by 20% this year. Since January 2022, nearly 3,000 people have attempted to cross illegally to Greece from Turkey, in a total of 82 attempts, according to figures from the Greek Immigration Ministry.
23126	21	In this context, Greece has also deployed hundreds of additional border guards to reinforce patrols along the border with Turkey in the Evros region in recent weeks. In total, about 1,000 Greek soldiers ensure the protection of some 500 km of river border.
23126	23	As part of the Europe agreement signed in 2016, Turkey agreed to curb the flow of migrants to the EU via Greece in exchange for 6 billion euros to support refugee-related services.
23126	25	In addition, Athens has also asked Brussels to obtain financial assistance to carry out this work to extend the fence. For the moment, no details on the amount of the project have been communicated but it is a safe bet that the European Union will not give its agreement: already last year, 12 States (including Greece) were denied funding for the construction of border walls by the European Commission.
23126	27	Thus, on October 22, 2021, Ursula von der Leyen declared that the EU will not finance “barbed wire and walls” at its borders to protect itself from the flow of illegal immigrants. However, the President of the Commission has not proposed a more effective alternative solution allowing Europe to no longer be a migratory strainer...
23128	1	Ecstasy and nuclear weapons: the Belgian military base of NATO housed a drug laboratory -
23128	3	"According to information provided by the Belgian Defense and reported by the Huffington Post, the laboratory was so close that the Defense initially believed that it was in the base. A first press release from the public prosecutor's office of the Belgian province of Limburg (north) had underlined in the afternoon that the clandestine laboratory, discovered last week, was located ""on the military domain""."
23128	5	"“On Wednesday June 22, 2022, the local police in the Campine discovered a synthetic drug laboratory, located on the military domain (NATO) in Peer” and “used for the production of MDMA” (or ecstasy), could we read in this press release. The laboratory ""was dismantled by the specialized services of the federal police, in collaboration with the National Institute of Criminology (NICC) and Civil Protection"", then specified the text. It seems that ""a neighboring house"" is involved in the creation of this clandestine laboratory."
23128	7	In the evening, the Belgian Defense rectified the information of the prosecution to AFP. According to the Belgian authorities, this infrastructure is located “on former military land, near the base”, but not on the airbase itself.
23128	9	Comment: Is this really the case or are we still seeing damage control!
23128	11	"According to the same source, two people were arrested on the spot when the installation was discovered. These two suspects, released after being questioned by investigators, ""are not Defense employees"", she said."
23128	13	A base long kept secret
23128	15	Belgium, a member of the politico-military organization which is in fact led by the United States, has long chosen to keep secret the presence of nuclear weapons on the base of Kleine-Brogel, where a contingent of the US army. A secret that hasn't been since the end of the 1980s; a Belgian minister had then recognized the presence of these armaments. However, their exact number has never been disclosed. The surroundings of the site - a large perimeter of approximately 4 km by 3 km, according to a spokesperson for the Defense - have repeatedly been the subject of demonstrations which denounce this lack of transparency.
23128	17	"In 2019, Belgian MP Samuel Cogolati estimated that ""10 to 20"" nuclear warheads were stored under American control on this base."
23129	1	ALPHA MALES versus BETA FEMALES
23129	3	Trump, Putin, Xi Jinping, Erdoğan, Bolsonaro... and many more... against... Biden, Trudeau, Macron, von der Leyen. What separates them? What brings them together?
23129	5	To identify the general contours of Alpha and Beta, it is easier to compare the results of France and Russia.
23129	7	GDP per capita is a relatively reliable measure of a country's development. That of France is much lower than that of the USA but it is 1.56 times higher than that of Russia. The state will be able to take part of the GDP to meet its needs. The rate of compulsory levies is around 45.0% of GDP for France and has been constantly increasing since the 1960s, it is among the world champions in the field. Russia makes slightly more modest levies (36.2%).
23129	9	The struggle for dominance, whether relatively peaceful or extremely belligerent, is a universal constant of any organized society. Alphas will inevitably fight Betas simply because they are different.
23129	11	Russian military spending is relatively twice as high as that of France as a proportion of GDP but remains comparable in absolute terms. Military service was abolished in France in 1997, it is compulsory in Russia for young people aged 18 to 27 and lasts two years.
23129	13	But what most distinguishes France and Russia is the public debt. Each French person 'owes' around $40,000 to the rest of the world, the Russians 20 times less.
23129	15	After a brief but representative inventory, what are the weapons of each of the fighters?
23129	17	Every leader strives to be as powerful as possible and to do this is concerned with bringing behind him the greatest possible part of the living forces of the people he is supposed to lead. The Alphas will use coercion, the Betas seduction.
23129	19	Russia's head of state is a president elected by direct universal suffrage for a six-year term. The legislative power is represented by the Duma formed by 450 deputies elected by direct universal suffrage. Numerous electoral frauds have been denounced, the emergence of opposition forces is hazardous to say the least, certain notable activists have been assassinated, others have suffered assassination attempts, the Kremlin has a certain hold on the channels of television or private newspapers. At the beginning of his presidential term, Vladimir Putin announced his objective of establishing the “dictatorship of law” and fighting against the mafia of the oligarchs. His presidency followed an era of laissez-faire under Boris Yeltsin. Russia finally recovered economically and economic and financial legislation made substantial progress without, however, developing the rule of law.
23129	21	France, for its part, relies on feminism and the rights of minorities, quite substantially homosexual minorities, to establish coherence in the visible part of society, that of intellectuals, academics and the media, by relegating the working classes to the obscurity accused of racism, homophobia or even, if need be, of conspiracy or anti-Semitism. The character thought of as summary of the popular impulses makes it possible to argue these accusations. Of course the real decisions, those relating to the economy, are not left in the hands of 'those-who-are-nothing', learned people loaded with theories take them out of sight.
23129	23	The Beta borrow a divisive strategy to divide the possible forces of protest by flattering what some call the elites and scorning the others, the Alpha want to dominate the whole of the people by removing if necessary those they consider dangerous.
23129	25	The Beta are for the moment very largely victorious in Europe, to be convinced of this it is enough to consider the desire of almost all Nations to join their community. It is undeniable that the installation of hierarchies and micro-chiefdoms helps the socio-economic development of a country. But the macro-economic system is also a huge help. The world of finance creates virtual wealth out of nothing, that is to say speculation, and the monetary mountains thus created can allow states to get into heavy debt: Betas live heavily on credit, not Alphas.
23129	27	So brute force or seduction as a weapon of war?
23129	29	If the people are often attracted by the attractions of the Beta, their leaders, who want to be concerned about their differences with others, are more divided. Following the opinions of the people, even if they in fact only reflect their desires for immediate enjoyment, removes their reason for being from the powerful or at least from those who think they are, which may explain their reluctance.
23129	31	The war between Russia and Ukraine makes it possible to see more clearly between the allies of the Alphas and those of the Betas. Essentially, the Beta groups together the USA and the Europeans as a hard core. South America, Australia and half of the African states do not approve of the invasion but have not (yet) applied sanctions. More or less explicitly, the Alpha group under the banner of Russia, China, India, part of the Maghreb countries, Iraq, Iran. If wealth predominates for the Beta, the populations and areas of the countries concerned are more balanced between the two camps.
23129	33	The analysis, necessarily summary and inevitably biased despite certain efforts to avoid it, does not take into account the humanist or ideological values ​​agitated by some as by the others because they only intervene marginally when they suit one or the other side.
2313	1	Russian state TV reassures its viewers about nuclear war: “We are all going to die one day”
2313	3	"On Tuesday, Russian state television hosts raised the possibility of a war that would spread beyond Ukraine, and Margarita Simonyan, a journalist and head of RT, told viewers that a nuclear war would be acceptable because ""we are all going to die one day. »"
2313	5	Russian television has repeatedly raised the idea of ​​a war that would extend beyond Ukraine alone, promoting the idea of ​​an “inevitable” war against “Europe and the world. Major Russian channels are notorious for the vitriolic rhetoric they broadcast to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
2313	7	On Tuesday night's program, The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, host Vladimir Solovyov, accompanied by Simonyan, said that to prevent other countries from intervening in Russia's war with Ukraine, consideration should be given to a nuclear war.
2313	9	"""Personally, I think the most realistic path is World War III, based on knowing us and knowing our leader, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,"" Simonyan said according to the Daily Beast, ""knowing how everything works here, it's impossible – there's no way – that we'll give up. »"
2313	11	Simonyan went on to say, “Everything will end with a nuclear strike is more likely than the other outcome. It is to my horror, on the one hand, but on the other hand, with the understanding that it is what it is. »
2313	13	Vladimir Solovyov added: “But we will go to heaven, while they will simply cross paths. »
2313	15	“We are all going to die one day,” Simonyan told the audience.
2313	17	"Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials have consistently made threatening statements about NATO. In a speech on Wednesday, Putin said any country that tried to intervene and create ""unacceptable threats to us, of a strategic nature"" would be met with a ""lightning"" response, Agence France-France reported. Hurry."
2313	19	"Mr Solovyov also referred to Western artillery deliveries to Ukraine on Tuesday's talk show, and asked: ""What stops us from hitting UK territory, targeting these centers logistics where these weapons are loaded? »"
2313	21	"Another guest on the show, Andrey Sidorov, assistant dean for global politics at Moscow State University, replied: ""If we decide to hit the UK, we should decide to hit the United States instead. United […]. Final decisions are not made in London, but in Washington. If we want to hit the real center of the West, then we have to hit Washington. »"
2313	23	Fiona Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council, appeared on a Times Radio podcast on Tuesday, saying Putin using nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a viable possibility.
23130	3	"From Mar-a-Lago, the accusations continue. In an interview with conservative show Just The News, Donald Trump again accused Hunter Biden, who is under investigation in Delaware over his 'tax affairs', of taking money of the widow of the former mayor of Moscow, calling on Vladimir Putin to ""publish"" any information on the subject: ""She gave the Bidens, the two, 3.5 million dollars, that's a lot of money. She gave him $3.5 million, so I think Putin knows the answer to that question. I think he should post it. »"
23130	5	He thus repeats information taken from an investigation by Republican senators, published in September 2020, which focused in particular on the role played by Hunter Biden within the Ukrainian gas group Burisma Holdings, of which he joined the board of directors in 2014. before resigning in April 2019, and the potential consequences of Hunter Biden's overseas business on the policies of his father, then vice president. The investigation revealed that Elena Baturina, businesswoman and widow of Yury Luzhkov – with whom Donald Trump himself tried unsuccessfully to do business in the 1990s – would have paid 3.5 million dollars to Rosemont Seneca Thornton in 2014 for consulting services. Hunter Biden's lawyer had denied any link with his client: according to him, the son of the American president is co-founder of an investment company called Rosemont Seneca Advisors, but which would have no link with the company mentioned above.
23130	7	"The call from the foot of the former American president to Vladimir Putin comes a month after Donald Trump had praised his strategy against Ukraine: ""Yesterday I saw a TV screen and I said: 'This is genius."" Putin declares a large part of Ukraine independent. Oh, it's wonderful, ""he said during the podcast recorded with the two conservative hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, referring to Moscow's recognition of the independence of the self-proclaimed republics of Lugansk and Donetsk. The billionaire had continued his praise of the strategy of Vladimir Putin, “a guy who is very clever” whom he knows “very, very well”: “I said:” How brilliant. He’s going to go there and keep the peace there…”"

23132	3	Emmanuel Macron commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Evian agreements at the Elysée, in the presence of witnesses of the time (conscripts, independence fighters, harkis), this Saturday March 19, 2022. But the date of March 19, 1962 is disputed in particular by Marine Le Pen.

23132	9	Invited on Friday March 18 on France Inter, the candidate of the National Rally for the presidential election recalled that “we have long contested this chosen date, which was imposed as the end of the Algerian war”. “There are tens of thousands of harkis who were brutally murdered after this date. And I want to pay tribute to them, because they were particularly badly treated by the government of the time, they were put in camps, sometimes they died, were put in mass graves, their children haven't been to school,” she said.
23132	11	The MP for Pas-de-Calais also denounced the position of the former French colony on its history with France. “If it is a question of reconciling memories by flagellating in front of Algeria which continues to ask for acts of repentance, as far as I am concerned it will be no. Unless perhaps Algeria itself asks forgiveness from the harkis for the way they behaved towards them, then there will be a real reconciliation of memories, ”she said.

23133	9	"But abortion remains a right strewn with pitfalls in this country with a strong Catholic tradition where conscientious objection from doctors is massive and where anti-abortion movements are very active. These groups frequently meet in front of clinics to try to convince women not to have abortions by showing them plastic fetuses or putting them in vehicles equipped with ultrasound machines. Anti-abortion activists demonstrated on Wednesday in front of the Senate to denounce a ""criminalization"" of their activities. In January, the Association of Catholic Propagandists (ACdP) deployed 260 billboards in 33 cities, including the Madrid metro, with the slogan “Praying in front of a clinic that performs abortion is great”."
23133	11	In 2015, the right, then in power, wanted to return to the 1985 law. provide parental consent. The left-wing government wants to repeal this provision and also guarantee a minimum of access to abortion in the public health system, while the vast majority of abortions are performed in the private sector. In Spain, women sometimes have to travel hundreds of kilometers to have an abortion due to the lack of specialized services nearby. Eight of the country's 50 provinces have had no abortions since its decriminalization in 1985, according to the government.
23134	1	What if France offered asylum to Americans who want an abortion?
23134	3	"Several thousand people demonstrated on Saturday in several cities in France ""for the defense of the right to abortion"". They were 1500 in Paris."
23134	5	Brandishing hangers painted red, very young women marched singing: “From New York to Paris, free and free abortion”. “Keep your laws off my body,” it read, with many of the signs written in English. The californication[1] of the world is advancing.
23134	7	What if France offered asylum to pregnant Americans… and if social security offered to welcome in France, free of charge, American refugees who want an abortion. They could be welcomed in a pretty clinic in Normandy; but killing future little Americans close to where the GIs died on our beaches, one morning when we were not there, as Sardou sang, would be too enjoyable for the primary and visceral anti-Americans on the left like d 'far right ; it would be better to offer the Saint Barth hospital, a stone's throw from Florida, to save on transport.
23134	9	"Hence the idea of ​​chartering a liner, like The fun cruise. The Pacific Princess renamed for the occasion The After-Love Boat would coast but at a good distance from the American coast. Captain Merrill Stubing would welcome young pregnant women in spite of themselves, alongside Doctor Adam ""Doc"" Bricker who would offer à la carte abortions, bartender Isaac Washington would prepare vitamin cocktails with an egg yolk to perk up these ladies, there would also have Julie McCoy director of the floating clinic, and Vicki Stubing, the daughter of the Captain in nurse. Purser Burl ""Gopher"" Smith, Fred Grandy in town, who made a career as a Republican would, of course, not be there."
23134	11	Free abortions to all foreigners, including Americans
23134	13	Because, more seriously, can you imagine that in response to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to overturn Roe vs. Wade and to bring the issue of abortion down to the state level, the British Medical Association union is pressuring its government to provide free abortions to all foreigners, including Americans, whether their own country pays or not. for the procedure. British taxpayers, presumably, would foot the bill.
23134	15	"According to an article in the Telegraph[2], Britain's BMA union has approved a motion that would allow it to push the UK state to ""support the provision of free and safe abortion care to all nationals who seek it in the UK , without submitting them to the prior tariff for patients abroad, regardless of borders”, during an emergency session which would have taken place on Wednesday."
23134	17	"The British Medical Association is far from the only body in the UK to condemn the recent US Supreme Court decision on abortion, many people and institutions across the country have opposed the decision of the US Court, including Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, calling it a ""big step backwards"". Definitely the culture of death has a bright future ahead of it, in our liberal western democracies."
23134	19	French President Emmanuel Macron was quick to speak out on the issue, which seems to have angered Marine Le Pen, who accused the French President of using abortion to distract from other issues like the purchasing power, security, immigration out of control, arguing that abortion was not at all threatened in France. We will add: certainly not by the one who looks down on Marion Maréchal – for whom abortion is far from being a trivial issue – by retorting that this is a lunar subject for voters.
23134	21	"""They just didn't want to have a f*** baby"""
23134	23	While pro-abortion activists consistently cite rape, incest, or life-threatening reasons why women should be able to kill their unborn children, only one percent of women have abortions because they became pregnant. because of rape, and less than 0.5 percent do so because of incest. According to Live Action[3], approximately 80% of abortions are optional or without reason.
23134	25	"English singer Lily Allen has revealed that she had an abortion, and claimed that no one had to ""justify"", adding that she and others abort their unborn children: ""just didn't want to have a fucking baby,” (because they just didn't want to have a fucking baby.) “AND THAT'S REASON ENOUGH! she shouted in capitals."
23134	27	The singer had the honesty to write on Instagram that she would like “people to stop posting examples of exceptional reasons to have an abortion. Most people I know, myself included, didn't want to have babies. »
23134	29	Allen's comments on social media come after she was seen on stage as a surprise guest of 19-year-old singer and Disney Channel star Olivia Rodrigo, with the two putting on airs of rebels as they smash open doors. Allen holding the middle finger of each hand aloft while doing pinwheels as Rodrigo names the US Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe vs. Wade.
23134	31	"""I'm devastated and terrified that so many women and girls are going to die because of this,"" Olivia Rodrigo said in contradiction to Lilly Allen's comments quoted above. The Disney Channel star called out the names of the Supreme Court justices, adding, ""We hate you."" Then the Californian and the English sang Allen's song, ""Fuck You""."
23134	33	"All these young girls present in England, this June 25, 2022, during the fourth day of the Glastonbury Festival (see the video[4]) who seem to want to be ""fucked"" without precaution or limit, brings us back to this improbable film from 1970 , L'Homme Orchester where Louis De Funès sings: “When you do lalala lala, think of the consequences.[5] Another time!"
23134	35	P.S. : I sometimes have this crazy dream: what if we simply returned to the Veil law of 1975 stricto sensu. Wouldn't that be great progress for the French? But you can't imagine the outcry it would cause.
23136	1	"Are LGBT people going to demand Macron's ""coming out""?"
23136	3	"""But homophobia also kills psychologically, through moral harassment which undermines a large part of us and leads some to go as far as suicide (remember that we have a suicide rate three times higher than the population)! This cover is therefore intended to speak to everyone and mainly to our candidates for the presidential election. Because even if our rights are advancing (the current five-year term proves it), we must continue to mobilize in particular for the fight against homophobia ”."
23136	5	"“Will education save us? The role of National Education in particular is a tremendous lever in raising awareness among the younger generations. This is what we think of the editorial staff of Garcon Magazine; which allows us to hope that the end of the tunnel is clearly visible and that solutions exist. ""Manu"", do not lose the pedals, they are counting on you to continue a lot of social progress LGBTQI +. »"
23136	7	"However, not skimping on symbolic, financial and legislative means, Manu has greatly advanced their cause and that of transsexuals. As he has proven on many occasions, he is very concerned about transidentity... With the unforgettable Fête de la Musique 2018... Then the Blanquer circular, in September 2021, on the inclusion of children who feel transgender... In the middle of the presidential campaign , just before Parliament went into recess, on January 25, 2022, it precipitated the vote on a law called: ""Prohibition of practices aimed at modifying a person's sexual orientation or gender identity"" , legislation going much further than its title. This law promoting gender utopia: no matter what is real, only the feeling counts, which is now essential in the social sphere..."
23136	9	One can therefore only wonder about the purpose of this front page. Would this magazine finally get the failed coming out of 2017?
23136	11	Leader of a war that does not concern us or little, Macron would have risen to 30%, it is very likely that assuming himself gay and married to a transsexual, he would climb to 50%, the French being proud to oppose the belligerent and outdated virility of old Putin, a young head of state in tune with his time and his country.
23137	1	"Hungary declares war on the European Union: ""nobody will impose an embargo on Russian gas"""
23137	3	More than three months after the start of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions pronounced by the West against Russia, Hungary maintains its showdown with the European Union and categorically refuses any embargo on Russian gas
23137	5	More than three months after the heavy economic sanctions imposed on Russia, Hungary is not taking off. This country whose economy is very dependent on Russian gas had already made it known that it had no intention of doing without Russian gas. And three months later, Budapest is maintaining its showdown with the EU.
23137	7	Indeed, according to the Hungarian media BudapestTimes.hu, the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijjarto, let it be known that the Hungarian State, led by Viktor Orban, does not even plan to discuss the embargo on the Russian gas with the European authorities. For the head of Hungarian diplomacy, it is out of the question that the EU imposes this embargo on all member states.
23137	9	“We have no problem with the European Union looking for new sources of gas supply, but participation must be voluntary. No obligation relating to supplies (in gas, editor's note) can be imposed on the Member States”, he warns.
23137	11	It should be remembered that this is not the first time that Viktor Orban's government has publicly expressed its disagreement with imposing an embargo on Russian gas. Indeed, according to the American media Bloomberg, which quoted a senior Hungarian government official, Budapest is totally opposed to this measure, going so far as to evoke the hypothesis of putting its veto.
23137	13	"""Such decisions require unanimity, it makes no sense for the Commission to impose sanctions affecting Russian gas and oil and which would endanger supplies to Hungary"", denounced Minister Gergely Gulyas during his appearance on the HirTV channel."
23137	15	Faced with a possible Russian gas cut in the West, which would have disastrous consequences for Hungary, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, did not fail to sound the alarm bell last March. “We have to take into account that most of our oil and gas imports come from Russia. 90% of homes in Hungary heat up with Russian gas,” he warned, adding that without this precious Russian gas, the Hungarian economy would shut down overnight.
23139	1	The real goals behind covid-19: The world after
23139	3	Today's world, based on infinite growth but with limited resources, is no longer possible. Countries are taking out loans that they will have to repay in 100 years!! The arrival of new technologies and growing robotization are causing more and more unemployment on a global scale: and the left behind number in the millions. We are at the end of an economic cycle, and covid-19 is the ideal excuse to impose large-scale reforms on a global scale, which would not have been accepted by the people in normal times. Shopping on the internet, teleworking, vaccination on a global scale (wanted by Bill Gates and the globalists), the multiplication of taxes for the benefit of the environment and the reduction of our freedoms will be part of the profound changes that we will face in the coming years...that only a revolt of the peoples can prevent.Why Dr Raoult Has it been attacked so much? Is the French government abusing the situation to impose mass surveillance? Why have we been confined and what will be the impacts on our health? Who are the real winners and losers of this crisis? Will international relations change and what will be the consequences? What will be the “GREAT RESET” announced by the World Economic Forum? Are French savings in danger? Are we going to see a real estate crisis? Are we going to see a total overhaul of the EU? Is a revolution possible in France? These are the main questions we will try to answer. Because many of us still think that it's just a bad time to pass, and that in a few months, everything will go back in order. No ! we are only at the beginning of a chapter that will turn the world upside down and change all our habits...
2314	1	War is war, and this war will escalate.
2314	3	It is indeed war. NATO is at war with Russia. German jurists may say no, but when the West arms Ukraine, when NATO special forces are in kyiv (i.e. British SAS) and train their militia proteges to use their weapons to kill Russians, does it really matter which shoulder fires the (British-made) Starstreak missile that shoots down a Russian helicopter?
2314	5	Anyway, this “war” (proxy war, if you prefer) was actually started in 2014, and escalated dramatically in 2017, when NATO stopped relying on national forces Ukrainian forces (who had proven somewhat inclined to defect, with their arms, to Russian-speaking militias), to resort to internationalists and mercenaries, with the aggressive intention of weakening and dragging Russia into a quagmire .
2314	7	War is war, and this war will escalate.
2314	9	"Nobody knows the exact number of these far-right militias set up by the West, but Reuters puts the figure at one hundred thousand, which Jacques Baud, former senior NATO adviser, notes and approves. These paramilitaries, however, play no role in normal field warfare, but instead focus on maintaining ""order"" [i.e. strict adherence to the rules] in the towns. And that's exactly what you got in Mariupol and elsewhere. These Azov-type militias are not equipped for field operations. They are equipped for urban warfare. To be clear, this ruthless Idlib-style mode of urban warfare is not about defeating the Russian army, but dragging it into sweltering, enveloping mud."
2314	11	Until February of this year, this scheme was essentially intended to run as an attrition campaign; an incipient quagmire. But suddenly, on February 16, there was a massive increase in artillery fire from the Ukrainian side (about 30 times more than in the past, according to the OSCE) and it coincided with Biden's predictions of an invasion. impending Russian. For the Russians, and for President Putin in particular, this was the sign of the beginning of the expected war of attrition. And so on February 24, Russia's special military operation was launched.
2314	13	Why attrition? Why not an ordinary war? Well, because NATO didn't want to put its “boots” on the ground. She wanted a low-intensity insurgency.
2314	15	Why ? Because it had been decided that the collapse of Russia (the ultimate goal) must above all be obtained by an all-out financial war (thus avoiding American losses): Thousands of sanctions; the seizure of Russian foreign exchange reserves; and a concerted effort to sink the ruble. In March, Biden was already boasting in his State of the Union address that the ruble had collapsed by 30% and the Russian stock market by 40%. The fighting in Ukraine was therefore treated as giving the pain of the financial war more time to bite into Russia.
2314	17	But today we see that the calculus is changing. In fact, it must change, because the dynamics and delays are reversed:
2314	19	First, Russia's economy did not collapse. The ruble returned to the level where it was before February 24. Then the West rolled out its unprecedented anti-Putin PSYOP amid near-daily allegations of atrocities and war crimes attributed to Russia.
2314	21	The PSYOP war completely imbued the European public with passionate animosity and hatred for Putin and the Russian people. Its “success” in this regard is beyond doubt.
2314	23	But there seems to have been a less-noticed Anglo-American sub-plot as well: This sub-plot is to weaken Germany and keep it from allying with Russia – for at least a generation. This last aspiration is well established and has existed since before the First World War.
2314	25	War is war, and this war will escalate.
2314	27	"As Ambrose Evans-Pritchard wrote in the Telegraph this week, ""Olaf Scholz must choose between an energy embargo on Russia and a moral embargo on Germany"": ""... Western Europe's refusal to cut the financing of Vladimir Putin's war machine is unsustainable. The moral and political damage for the EU becomes prohibitive”."
2314	29	But note the corollary: To push for this EU energy embargo, Britain is upping the ante by demanding a
2314	30	"""Western response to the height of the existential threat facing the European liberal order""."
2314	32	So here is the revised grand program: Russia survives the financial war because the EU continues to buy gas and energy from Russia. The EU - and specifically Germany - is funding Putin's 'grotesque unprovoked war', the meme says. Not a euro should reach Putin”.
2314	34	"Isn't this just an evolution of the West's goals in February? No. Because the strategy of the ""boycott of Russian energy"" does not consist in giving the ""treasury war"" time to bear fruit, but rather in ""drawing the curtain on Europe"", of course, and on the Germany in particular. And soon."
2314	36	Europe has no means of replacing Russian energy with other sources in the years to come. But European leaders, consumed by a frenzy of outrage at a flood of images of atrocities emanating from Ukraine – and by a sense that the “liberal world” must at all costs avoid a loss in the Ukrainian conflict – seem ready to go all the way. The energy ban could happen quite quickly.
2314	38	"But here's the catch: the United States sees that its ""war"" of attrition is a failure. The Ukrainian army is surrounded and will soon be eliminated (one way or another)."
2314	40	Thus, the question is no longer whether the war of attrition can give the sanctions more time to bite on the Russian population. The Treasury war also fails (for complex reasons related to the fact that the Bank of Russia links the ruble to gold and the ruble to energy).
2314	42	Here again, it is the economic/financial consequences that change the game. Inflation is skyrocketing in Europe, and will rise further. And public sentiment is changing: “Public support for sanctions against Russia is waning as the cost of living crisis begins to bite, according to a poll. The proportion of public opinion that would accept higher fuel prices as a result of harsh Western sanctions against Russia has fallen 14 points in one month, from 50% in March to 36% this week”.
2314	44	Deadlines no longer match: Euro-sanctions (theoretically) need more time to take effect. However, the West does not have the time. It's inflation biting “now” (and turning European sentiment against the Ukrainian project). The last thing the European establishment wants is a “European Spring” (as a counterpoint to the Arab Spring).
2314	46	"The West faces a stark choice: Public support for the Ukrainian project may be fading, just as the realities on the ground show that the ""liberal European order"" is not will not be saved from disintegration - by Ukraine."
23140	3	The speeches of central bankers have always been pretentious, pompous and jargon. Recently, they become inconsistent.
23140	5	Thus, to say that the rise in short-term interest rates is a means of combating inflation is tantamount to admitting the opposite: the fall in short-term interest rates is a means of creating inflation. It is therefore to admit that the previous rate cuts were inflationary. Consequently, inflation cannot be transitory, as our financial eminences have claimed. Simply, as always, it took time to show up and spread into the prices of everyday life.
23140	7	Since the 2008 crisis, the GDP of the eurozone has stagnated while its money supply has doubled. Suppose a schoolyard where students buy candy with Monopoly tickets. Any child understands that the more tickets there are to redeem the same amount of candy, the more the candy will cost. It doesn't matter where the tickets come from. Until someone decides to burn the excess Monopoly tickets, the price of the candy will not return to its previous level.
23140	9	"Sagacious readers will object that ""yaka"" make more sweets. Yes, but it's harder to do than Monopoly tickets. The talents of Yellen, Powell, Draghi, Lagarde et Cie are limited to monetary creation and they have never put their hands in confectionery or more generally in the sludge of the real economy."
23140	11	So for decades, central banks have been creating too much money or credit (it's the same thing). This mechanism was put in place a long time ago, when the dollar cut itself off from gold in 1971 and all currencies became floating.
23140	13	Creation got carried away with each crisis: oil shocks of the 1970s, internet bubble, subprime credit bubble, euro debt crisis, post-covid recovery and, in Europe, the fight against climate change. Every time you think you've reached the pinnacle of stupidity, you're wrong.
23140	15	The magic money tap of central banks
23140	17	Central banks accelerate money creation by lowering so-called key interest rates: this rate fixes the price of the money newly created by commercial banks. The cheaper it is, the easier it is for banks to grant credit and vice versa.
23140	19	For the record, we live in a monetary and banking system in which credits make deposits and not the other way around like in grandpa's time. This is the principle of fractional reserves: banks have the privilege of lending money that does not exist.
23140	21	More expensive monetary creation does not mean that the magic money tap is closed. Credit is still being created, but less quickly. This is why central banks cannot fight inflation. Imagine that you have the power to open a tap but never to close it completely... Liquidity always flows, only the flow is modified.
23140	23	Central banks have also, since 2008, manipulated long-term interest rates. They nationalized the bond market by buying up debt issues from their parent states and some large corporations. By doing so, they have facilitated public deficits and debts.
23140	25	Who will burn the Monopoly tickets?
23140	27	To really fight inflation, central banks should:
23140	29	- Raise key rates to monstrous levels (well above official inflation indices)
23140	31	- Resell what they have bought (to make it look like a fake demand) so, in the case of the ECB, the debt of Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France...
23140	33	If they do that, they will trigger a monstrous recession. Many companies on life support, living off refinancing at near-zero rates, will go bankrupt. Including banks, the same institutions that created the need for a central bank. Including, too, many large states that will be unable to honor their debts.
23140	35	Surplus Monopoly notes are never voluntarily destroyed by those who put them into circulation (the central banks) or those who profited from them first (the banking and financial system). They are always destroyed by bankruptcies as history shows.
23140	37	A central bank is primarily a bank serving banks, not the public
23140	39	To try to avoid the debacle, the central banks will do what they have always done: reopen the tap of money creation. We may therefore see a few bankruptcies or crashes as a result of a timid rate hike, then we will be told that we must save the economy, relaunch and therefore... lower rates! At that point, the trust capital that this inept financial system has could be shaken.
23140	41	"Perhaps the general public will realize that a ""central bank is nothing more than the head of a banking cartel, intended to manipulate the markets by controlling interest rates""."
23140	43	Central banks can indulge as much as they want in legal counterfeiting provided they save the banks and their supervisory states. This is called monetary policy. This crony capitalism is called ultra liberalism by the naive Nupes. However, in practice, inflation is a tax that does not need to be passed by any parliament.
23140	45	The anti-fragmentation of the eurozone: the new snake that Lagarde will make us swallow
23140	47	Despite all the ongoing monetary embezzlement, the borrowing rates of eurozone countries are starting to diverge again. Suddenly, the European Central Bank must dress a new pass of monetary creation. Here is what Reuters tells us:
23140	49	The European Central Bank (ECB) will buy bonds issued by Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece using the product of the German, French and Dutch debt maturities it holds in its portfolio, to limit the widening of yield differences between states.
23140	51	"Over-indebted France will therefore devote money that it does not have to help countries even more over-indebted and economically weak than it. As the young people say ""it's going to be fine""..."
23140	53	Concretely, the euro should continue to unscrew against the dollar; double pain for our energy imports: the unfavorable exchange rate effect will be added to the rise in the price of fossil fuels. Which will lead to more money creation to accelerate an inefficient and wasteful energy transition.
23140	55	The general public will finally end up discovering at their expense that a central bank does not fight against inflation but uses it to its advantage. But this will require a monetary crisis, the mechanisms of which I explain here.
23141	1	Turbine or not turbine? Germany in the doldrums
23141	3	An article from Conflicts
23141	5	To be, or not to be, that is the question: in a few words, Shakespeare made his prince Hamlet say the existential question of being, even if it means suffering, or no longer being by rebelling and risking death. Germans are living these days with this universal refrain of doubt: live with Russian gas or die economically without Russian gas, that is the question.
23141	7	Power plants can't do much
23141	9	A wind of panic now seems to be blowing over Germany. As the months pass and the war shows more and more signs of a stalemate, the authorities fear they will be forced to cut off the gas supply to industries (before being forced to do so for citizens) despite appropriate government efforts to alleviate the situation.
23141	11	Continuing — or even increasing — electricity generation by burning the country's lignite and even maintaining the few nuclear power plants that have not yet been shut down will not be enough to get Germany out of trouble for one simple reason. which is often ignored or even concealed. Natural gas is mainly used for thermal purposes, i.e. to produce process heat or to heat homes and services. 70% of natural gas in the EU is used for heating, and power stations can't help it.
23141	13	Ludwigshafen panic
23141	15	The German chemical industry has sounded the alarm. Martin Brudermüller, the boss of the giant chemical company BASF clearly opposed a possible embargo on Russian gas:
23141	17	“Ceasing our imports of Russian gas would cause irreversible damage to the national economy […] it could plunge the German economy into its biggest crisis since the end of the Second World War.”
23141	19	Not only is natural gas a raw material for the chemical and petrochemical industry – including to produce hydrogen, the new star of the political world, but also to supply heat to all industrial processes. Which makes Martin Brudermüller say that it is “an existential threat for German SMEs”, in addition to that of the big chemical industry. Without, however, BASF abandoning its unilateral self-punishing goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
23141	21	Should we laugh or cry when we read that alleged geopolitical energy strategists from MAN Energy Solution are thinking of heating ovens and crackers with electricity? Panicked at the idea that Vladimir Putin could close the gas valve, the large industrial complexes say nonsense.
23141	23	But German citizens cannot go through the winter without heating either. This is why the government is rightly trying to accumulate as much gas as possible in its underground storage facilities. But it will take at least five years for Germany to be freed from its dependence on Russia. Errors in energy geopolitics are costly and long-lasting. Moscow knows this, which is why it dared to launch war in Ukraine.
23141	25	Less gas in the Nord Stream 1
23141	27	It was found that, since June 14, the gas flow in the famous Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline has decreased. While its maximum capacity is 150-170 million cubic meters per day (Mm3/d), Gazprom has announced that it will gradually reduce throughput to 67 Mm3/d.
23141	29	The reason given is a decision by Rostekhnadzor, the Russian technical safety agency, to shut down the turbines at the Portovaya compression plant on the Gulf of Finland near Vyborg. It is not a gas turbine as in a power station, but a turbomachine (centrifugal compressor), because the gas must be compressed enough — like a bicycle pump — to travel the 1200 km of gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
23141	31	Turbine or not?
23141	33	"These are Rolls-Royce turbomachines installed in 2011. In 2014, the Rolls-Royce centrifugal compressor business was acquired by the German Siemens and the manufacturing and therefore overhaul plant is located in Dorval (Montreal) . Like all spinning machines, Nord Stream 1 machines require an overhaul — whether it could be delayed remains open. A 52 MW machine was shipped to Canada for a major overhaul. Usually replacement equipment is available where it is used. Are there any in Portovaya? this is another open question. It is tempting to accuse Russia of using the security argument to not send enough gas to Germany. Moreover, as Italy - the second largest importer of Russian gas - is concerned about this reduction, during his visit to kyiv, the Italian Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, declared: ""We were told that the reason for the cuts in gas across Europe is technical, but Germany and we and others believe that to be lies. »"
23141	35	Is it really an energy weapon in retaliation for the sanctions it suffers? Admittedly, Moscow is cautious since there are take-or-pay contracts that oblige Gazprom to deliver gas (and EU companies to take it off). In a few years, there will be many negotiations before the arbitration courts between Russian and European companies.
23141	37	But the reciprocal accusations should make it possible to clarify things. Moscow accuses Ottawa of not allowing the return of the centrifugal turbine, which is now in good working order, because Canada has placed Gazprom on its list of companies under sanctions. The compressor can't leave Canada, Gazprom can't compress the gas enough, and the German tanks aren't filling up fast enough.
23141	39	"Gazprom says other turbomachinery will need to be overhauled and that for ""safety reasons"" the pipeline could be shut down, especially as scheduled maintenance takes place from July 11-21. Like Hamlet, no one knows what to do… including removing the gas stored for the winter in the middle of summer… As in the case of the watered sprinkler, the sanctions hit Russia, but also the EU."
23141	41	Canada gives up
23141	43	During the G7 in Bavaria, Olaf Scholz and Mario Draghi probably managed to convince Justin Trudeau to make a move so that Europeans would not be cold this winter.
23141	45	While Ukraine pressed Canada not to deliver the compressor to Russia, we learned on July 8 that Ottawa agreed to let the turbomachine go to Germany, which will then deliver it to Gazprom, thus not violating its own rules. Someone had to swallow a snake, especially since, according to Vitaly Yermakov (Valdai Club expert), Gazprom argued that one of the two pipes of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline blocked by Olaf Scholz was full and that it was enough to open the valve on the German side. The humiliation is sweeter for Ottawa than it would have been for Berlin.
23141	47	In war as in war
23141	49	In the same vein of the environmental argument, on July 6 a Russian regional court ordered a temporary halt to the flow of oil through the CPC pipeline that connects the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan to the Russian port of Novorossiysk , on the Black Sea along the Caspian Sea from the north. The environmental problem was highlighted just two days after the Kazakh president said his country was ready to ship to the European Union more than the 67 million tonnes of oil currently exported. It is probably easy to point out that a few months ago, an inspection of the pipeline revealed some relatively minor leaks. This decision of the regional court aggravated the situation by suspending the transit. As often, one is entitled to wonder if this is a message addressed to Kazakhstan so that it falls into line.
23141	51	Everything indicates that Moscow will now play the energy card in the proxy war with the United States and the European Union. Between now and winter, we can expect increasingly painful surprises for industry and European citizens. We hardly dare to think of what will happen in Ukraine this winter if Russia cuts off its gas since the country depends for 90% of its production on gas from the Donbass – which has become Russian – and imports 30% from Russia… The Ukrainians are going to die cold — figuratively and, alas, for some literally.
23141	53	"""Turbine or no turbine"" seems to be resolved. “Russian gas or no Russian gas, that is the question” ask the contemporary Hamlets."
23142	1	United States: the Democrats are preparing their own insurrection
23142	3	"For several weeks now, the Democrats and their media lackeys have been making their smoke show about the ""insurrection"" of January 6, 2020. The aim is thus to ""understand"" what led to this ""unprecedented attack"" on democracy. and identify culprits."
23142	5	I can't help but smirk when I see the Democrats hyperventilating over the Jan. 6 riot. Yes, those responsible must be identified and imprisoned. But when it comes time to resent defeat, Democrats have no lesson to teach anyone.
23142	7	Just look at the entire Trump presidency. From hearsay fabricated by the Clinton camp, attempts have been made again and again to convict the evil orange man for the heinous crime of defeating a Democrat too foolish to campaign in key states.
23142	9	"But even in power, Joe Biden's party is trying by all means to establish its power in a more than dubious way - an ""insurrection"" if we study its logic."
23142	11	"Indeed, following several decisions of the Supreme Court that went ""in the wrong direction"", several politicians and influential Democratic supporters did not go to any lengths to attack the Court."
23142	13	First there is the rejection of the Roe vs Wade decision, which leaked almost two months ago. So Democrats have had plenty of time to codify a federal abortion law. But since the turn of the century, many abortion supporters held such extreme positions and repugnant practices — not rejected by the Democratic establishment — that they couldn't.
23142	15	"This is why they claim from the rooftops that the Supreme Court has just banned abortion, which is false. Certainly, several states have already banned the practice or are about to do so. But others have changed nothing and even advertise themselves as “sanctuaries” for abortion. Several employers even offer to pay for the procedure for their ""employees with a uterus."" (insert easy joke about cost rationing for insurance)"
23142	17	Co-equal, not subservient
23142	19	The scum over the Supreme Court continued with other rulings on gun ownership, school vouchers, and whether or not the Federal Environmental Agency (EPA) was granted powers to regulate emissions. CO2. In each case, it was the “right” liberal decision to either restrict government restrictions or to remember that only Congress enacts laws, unless it explicitly delegates to an agency to do so for them.
23142	21	Unlike Republicans, who remained relatively calm in the face of a disadvantageous decision on immigration, Democrats were quick to question the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, calling for the inclusion of more justices to dilute the influence of the most conservative in this regard. moment, or even to dissolve it completely. Protesters have even attempted to violently invade the Arizona legislature without the media flinching. Many have even had the audacity to take advantage of it to finance their next campaign.
23142	23	Can you imagine the reaction of the Democrats and their lackeys if the Republicans had been so enraged if the decision had gone the other way? We would have gone further with the accusations of a threat to democracy. But with Democratic immunity, you get a golden ticket to anything.
23142	25	They can thus afford to shamelessly attack a co-equal branch of government which they wish to bend to their will. This ardent desire has existed since at least Franklin Roosevelt, who did not appreciate the cancellation of his unconstitutional New Deal, which squarely copied Mussolini's economic policy.
23142	27	In short, the Democrats remind us that they are at least as lamentable as the Republicans when it comes to attacking democratic institutions. Like any good party in a banana republic, they won't rest until all branches of government are on their side.
23142	29	The Freedom that enlightens the world does not have a power stronger than 15 watts, unfortunately...
23143	1	End of green bureaucracy in the US, but not in the EU
23143	3	An article from Conflicts
23143	5	The Supreme Court of the United States ends the bureaucracy that intends to control the lives of Americans. It would be urgent to protect the lives of European citizens against the useless and liberticidal bureaucracy of Brussels-Strasbourg.
23143	7	In the space of two weeks, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered historic decisions in June 2022 that will have important consequences for decades to come. She began by reaffirming that the right to bear arms is a constitutional right, that a sports teacher has the right to pray silently on a sports field, and then in the Dobbs case, the Court decided that the American Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion and that, therefore, the federal state does not have to deal with it, and that it is up to the people and their elected representatives to decide (see the article very comprehensive by Drieu Godefridi). These decisions shocked the politically correct world of Europe, which immediately criticized these decisions without even bothering to read the legal texts. President Macron and others have even taken the liberty of criticizing a decision by a sovereign court in a third state.
23143	9	To conclude the series of decisions from its June 2022 session, the US Supreme Court concluded that limiting CO₂ emissions from power plants should be decided by lawmakers and not by officials of the Environmental Protection Agency. (EPA).
23143	11	A snub for Joe Biden aka Barack Obama
23143	13	Like the Dobbs decision, West Virginia v. EPA was leaked to the press on June 14 — which is very unusual — to try if possible to modify the vote before it became final (an administrative investigation is underway). Unable to legislate on the decarbonization of power plants because America, and therefore also the legislature, is divided, President Barack Obama had authorized the federal agency to enact laws against coal plants. The justices ruled six to three that the EPA had no right to take legislative power. Just as they did not speak out on the merits of abortion, they did not speak out on the climate, but hinted that the Obama-Biden duo must go through a congressional decision if it wants to limit CO₂ emissions. The Court considers that Congress cannot abdicate, delegate its responsibility on major issues that affect the lives of American citizens such as CO₂ emissions. Since major policies must be approved by representatives, the administration attempts to legally impose its policy on Capitol Hill.
23143	15	"This decision has provoked many reactions and activists on both sides of the Atlantic are not letting it go. Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, manipulating information like all activists do, said ""the decision threatens to relegate the United States far behind our international partners who are accelerating their efforts to meet their climate commitments. ""."
23143	17	We will see at the end of this article that if there is any acceleration, it concerns global CO₂ emissions.
23143	19	The Wall Street Journal writes that the three “dissenting justices lament that Congress lacks the expertise to regulate technical matters such as climate change. In a footnote, Justice Gorsuch notes the 'evil' [sic] character of Woodrow Wilson, a progressive critic of the Constitution and a founder of the administrative state, as believing in government by experts because the people are stupid. The real problem for dissenters is that the Constitution deliberately makes it difficult to pass laws.”
23143	21	It could be argued that in the EU, it is the legislator who decides on these very complex issues, but it must also be recognized that the European legislator has created chaos, as we will see later.
23143	23	The lawsuit was launched at the request of the state of West Virginia, which has led a coalition of 20 other Republican states and coal companies to challenge environmental officials' abuse of power. which forced coal and gas producers to subsidize renewable energies. Ministries or agencies dealing with the environment are environmental strongholds that are there to “advocate for the cause”. I have experienced this in my professional life (read the excellent analysis by Philippe Silberzahn “When experts become activists”).
23143	25	Environmental activist experts
23143	27	On June 30, 2022, the European Court of Auditors published a report showing that the European Commission spent around one billion euros per year on external consultants between 2017 and 2020, the period during which the Fit55 decarbonization policy was designed. With regard to the use of external consultants, the Court of Auditors noted that “the use of these services nevertheless has significant shortcomings, which create risks of excessive dependence and conflict of interest. The Commission did not sufficiently manage these risks and provided only limited information on the use of consultants”. Oh sure, not all of these consultants are necessarily environmentalists, but if they dared not dance like the politically correct whistle, they just wouldn't get any more contracts.
23143	29	In the past, it was the services of the European Commission that controlled the expertise. “The Kinock reform” (around 2000) removed technical skills from services and since then, expertise has been provided by consultants and lobbies. The phenomenon is sublimated within the European Parliament. This results in increasingly complex decisions which, as we get into technical issues, are not necessarily rational or balanced. The 2018 directive amending the 2012 energy efficiency directive contains 20 pages of changes (in small print) to the 2012 directive, which had 54 pages, 15 annexes and even a complicated mathematical formula so difficult to write in text. So there are currently 74 pages of legislation in the Official Journal of the EU to explain how to do energy efficiency…
23143	31	It is urgent and essential to return to pragmatic realism, because the scale and the bureaucratic cost of our efforts to reduce emissions are increasingly detrimental to us. In the field of decarbonization (you will have noticed that we talk less and less about sustainable development) it is the environmental NGOs that are the most influential. Just look at the implausible decision to ban thermal vehicles by 2035. While it is believed that the car manufacturers' lobby is all-powerful, it is in fact the green lobbies that have imposed their will in the sector where Europe is the leader. This failure is such that the Stellantis group - 12 car brands - decided to leave the ACEA lobby, unable to defend its survival. We will not dwell on the thorny question of subsidies in Strasbourg and Brussels, where thousands of green lobbyists are paid through “projects”.
23143	33	Controlling carbon is controlling life
23143	35	What should we conclude?
23143	37	We have entered a hugely complex world that can no longer be mastered as the implications are many and varied, with equally complex timescales and feedback loops. Take the example of renewable energy: at first glance a brilliant and common-sense idea, but after 49 years of technological promotions and 22 years of market manipulation, we are facing an energy crisis that is hitting citizens and industry hard. . German wind turbines will not be able to do anything to save the German chemical industry if Vladimir Putin decides to stop supplying Germany with the natural gas that the factories sorely need to operate.
23143	39	"It is urgent to stop this mad race which leads to a disenchantment of the citizens for what has allowed us to live 70 years of peace. Instead of peace, we now have fear, poverty and lack of freedom. Since, as climatologist Richard Lindzen said, ""If you control carbon, you control life"", if the citizen does not react, not only will the EU control every detail of our life, but it will sink us even further in precariousness, the rest of the world not bothering with CO₂ emissions. Data from BP's Statistical Annual Review released this week shows global CO₂ emissions have increased by 59% since the 1990 base year, EU emissions have fallen by 27% and non-OECD emissions have increased by 135%. Our bureaucracy will never succeed in reducing global CO₂ emissions. Coal consumption in China and India accounts for two-thirds of global consumption. The state of West Virginia will continue, thanks to the United States Supreme Court, to burn coal like the rest of the world … just like us if Vladimir Putin takes revenge on European sanctions against Russia by cutting off the gas Russian."
23144	1	Pap Ndiaye at National Education: deconstruction and hypocrisy
23144	3	By Claude Meunier-Berthelot, teacher, essayist ♦ The appointment of Pap Ndiaye as head of the Ministry of National Education has sparked curious comments!
23144	5	Thus, this appointment would come in total contradiction with the educational policy of Blanquer who would be supposed to have been a fervent Republican! It is not trivial! This is not the first time that nonsense has been spread about National Education in general and about ministers in particular, but there is reason not only to laugh, but to be distressed at the crass ignorance of those who see in Blanquer a fervent Republican while, trumpeting the obligation to respect and bring to life the values ​​of the Republic - for our children only - he has made a murderous priority education policy, reinforcing in a way spectacular a policy of excellence in favor of populations of immigrant origin to whom, it is a safe bet that the values ​​of the Republic are no more taught than they are asked to be respected, when the school revolution that he bequeaths to Pap Ndiaye for our children destroys all the foundations of the public and private school institution under contract, from primary to university included, thus ruining their future for the benefit of immigrants.
23144	7	What is Pap Ndiaye planning?
23144	9	Let us beware, moreover, of thinking that changing ministers means changing policy.
23144	11	The first declarations of Pap Ndiaye are unequivocal: he claims a certain continuity with his predecessor: he will not touch Parcoursup or the reform of the bac no more than that of the high school.
23144	13	So, the school revolution put in place by Blanquer for our children through the upheaval of institutions, the disappearance of textbooks replaced by new documents, the recruitment of staff no longer on diploma but on profile and without qualification, the themes chosen and the excessive computerization…will continue and, while he insists on the “well-being” of children and staff at school, the question of knowledge is totally excluded.
23144	15	The proof is that the first decision of Pap Ndiaye is decree 2022-909 of June 20, 2022, the terms of which are as follows:
23144	17	“The decree opens the possibility for school teachers (teachers) to exercise their functions in a higher establishment; it allows vocational high school teachers to carry out their duties in general or technological high schools and colleges as well as to provide certain courses in higher education establishments. »
23144	19	What does that mean? That insofar as all courses are deleted, there is no longer any question of level and all staff are called upon to navigate from the old primary to the old university!
23144	21	What could be more logical !
23144	23	Parcoursup, machine to break excellence… and to promote the Great Replacement?
23144	25	"Pap Ndiaye's children excluded from public school ""welfare"""
23144	27	"But, this ""well-being"" that Pap Ndiaye organizes for our children and for the staff, he refuses it to his children! Would it be to bully them?"
23144	29	Indeed, Pap Ndiaye educates his children in a prestigious Parisian institution which is none other than the famous École alsacienne, a private establishment whose reputation is second to none and in which most of our ministers - including National Education – sent their children to school!
23144	31	"Pap Ndiaye had already refused the ""well-being"" of our children's public school to his own children, previously educated in REP+, in other words in the reinforced priority education networks, where a policy of excellence is practiced in benefit of immigrants."
23144	33	"This does not prevent him from declaring that ""French schools are doing very badly with underprivileged children"" - we mean ""non-national populations"" - and that ""this situation is not acceptable"", which, in clear terms, means that the priority education policy will be further strengthened."
23144	35	"In other words, Pap Ndiaye does not change gear. He was appointed to continue the ""deconstruction of France"" in accordance with Macron's project and in the continuity of the Blanquer ministry."
23144	37	But until when ?
23145	1	Macron/Putin: what message will be delivered?
23145	3	by Karine Bechet-Golovko.
23145	5	The Putin/Macron meeting, a week before that of the German Chancellor with the Russian President also in Moscow, could have given hope for a burst of common sense, or at least of survival instinct, from our European leaders. Unfortunately, there is a good chance that they will only be used by the United States as sounding boards, for a discourse that they do not construct. And their briefing by the White House before their Moscow “diplomatic” tour tends to confirm this.
23145	7	Macron arrives in Moscow today to talk to Putin about the situation in Ukraine and, as all the French press writes, to lead Putin to de-escalation. This against the backdrop of the French presidential campaign, in which the Macron figure is largely tainted by the management, as draconian as it is corrupt, of the Covid crisis. Not to mention the military escalation caused by the Ukrainian army on the front.
23145	9	"Before his trip, Macron kept repeating that France will take terrible measures with the West (meaning the United States) against Russia, if it invades Ukraine – repeating ad nauseam the Atlanticist discourse, which does not not even consider the possibility that Russia does not want to ""invade"" Ukraine."
23145	11	Just yesterday, Macron had a telephone interview with Biden, as revealed by Reuters, even if the French press is much more discreet on the subject...
23145	13	“The call, which lasted 40 minutes, allowed the two leaders to “share information on the contacts made during the weekend” with a view to good coordination before the trip, indicated the French presidency”.
23145	15	In a week, it is the German Chancellor's turn to come to Moscow. And unsurprisingly, he too will be briefed by Biden before his meeting with Putin:
23145	17	"The two leaders will discuss in particular ""their common commitment to pursue the diplomatic path as well as to join their efforts to deter Russia from any aggression against Ukraine"", declared the spokesperson for the American presidency Jen Psaki in a press release. ."
23145	19	"""This visit will be an opportunity to affirm the deep and solid ties between the United States and Germany,"" she also said."
23145	21	It feels a bit like watching a puppet show...
23145	23	If Europe and Russia really have a card to play to regulate the situation in Ukraine, as we wrote (see our text here), it is certainly not in this way. Because the most important thing is not the fact of the trip, but the message delivered. If France can only deliver the Atlanticist message, not only will this trip be useless, but it will damage the image of our country.
23147	1	Viktor Orban will support Marine Le Pen during his meeting in Reims
23147	3	Good news for Marine Le Pen. While several executives of his party recently joined Éric Zemmour, parasitizing his campaign, the candidate of the National Rally will be officially supported by Viktor Orban from his first major campaign meeting in Reims.
23147	5	According to information from France info, confirmed by BFMTV.com, the Hungarian Prime Minister will speak in a video this Saturday broadcast a few minutes before the arrival on stage of the MP.
23147	7	Signs of proximity for months
23147	9	This support was expected since his trip to Budapest last October. If Éric Zemmour had also visited Hungary a few days earlier, the atmosphere was quite different. While the former journalist from Le Figaro had only had the right to a private interview without an official photo, Marine Le Pen had seen the red carpet rolled out, in particular by holding a joint speech with the Magyar head of state. .
23147	11	The French and the Hungarian met again last weekend in Madrid for a summit of European nationalist conservatives. Parasitized by the words of MEP Nicolas Bay, who seemed to hesitate between Éric Zemmour and the RN, the meeting allowed Viktor Orban to renew his support for him again.
23147	13	A Hungarian bank has also agreed to lend 10.6 million euros to the party. It's a real breath of fresh air when, heavily in debt, the staff was so far forced to conduct a campaign at low cost.
23147	15	Staging its international posture
23147	17	"This remote speech also gives hope to the candidate of the constitution of a common group in the European Parliament ""perhaps in the coming months"". The RN had failed to form a group bringing together all the Eurosceptics after the last European elections and currently only sits with 8 other countries."
23147	19	Other European politicians should speak according to our information, like André Ventura, populist candidate for the Portuguese presidential election last January.
23147	21	A real opportunity for Marine Le Pen to work on her international stature and break out of her isolation on the foreign scene. In 2017, traveling to New York, she had tried to meet Donald Trump, without success. Only the Lebanese President, Michel Aoun, had agreed to receive her during the last presidential campaign.
23149	1	Even abroad, Le Pen is overtaken by the subject of departures to Zemmour
23149	3	POLITICS - A rake in Spain? Visiting Madrid to display her international stature alongside her European allies, Marine Le Pen is inevitably overtaken by the current difficulties of her campaign in France, between defections and threats of new “betrayals.”
23149	5	“In general, those who want to leave leave, but they leave now”, she thus launched, this Saturday January 29, to the journalists who made the trip to the Spanish capital, as you can see below , before adding: “What is unbearable is the taqiya (a concept in the Muslim religion recommending to conceal one's belief in case of danger Editor's note), which they themselves blame the Islamists. Taqiya is concealment.”
23149	7	A firm warning, the day after the statements of his niece Marion Maréchal who said he leaned more towards his rival Eric Zemmour, with regard to those who would like to imitate the RN MEPs Jérôme Rivière and Gilbert Collard, who have already “ crossed the Rubicon”.
23149	9	Nicolas Bay stirs up trouble
23149	11	Asked specifically about the case of Nicolas Bay, the MEP who accompanies her to Madrid but refused, on Saturday morning, to say whether he would support her until the end, Marine Le Pen specified that her remark applied “in a general way ” to all those who would like to leave it.
23149	13	To have people who, today, pretend to be here, when in reality their hearts or their minds are elsewhere, it's unbearableMarine Le Pen in Madrid
23149	15	"""To have people who, today, pretend to be here, when in reality their hearts or their minds are elsewhere, it's unbearable"", she replied again, on the sidelines of a meeting with the leaders of the European far right, adding: “It is a total lack of dignity, of respect for all of our activists who are fighting with conviction, with heart and courage .” Message received?"
23149	17	A few hours earlier, Nicolas Bay, cited among those tempted to join Eric Zemmour, kicked in on his unconditional support for the RN candidate, explaining that he was working on “a project that goes far beyond these little political adventures.”
23149	19	A form of restraint that caused a stir within the Lepenist delegation in Madrid. Caroline Parmentier, Marine Le Pen's press officer, harshly vilified MEP Nicolas Bay for his attitude. “I said to him: ‘bravo for your duplex this morning Nicolas. What are your values? Loyalty? There are limits to hypocrisy and duplicity,” she told AFP, confirming information from BFMTV on these tensions. “Get off now rather than chow down on the rack for as long as possible,” she added.
23149	21	Viktor Orban votes for Marine Le Pen
23149	23	Something to disturb, in this uncertain context, the message that Marine Le Pen wishes to send to Madrid. The patroness of the National Rally meets her sovereigntist allies there, including the Polish leaders Mateusz Morawiecki and Hungarian Viktor Orban, almost two months after a similar meeting in Warsaw.
23149	25	The latter also clearly showed his support for him this Saturday morning, when he had taken care to receive Eric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen in Budapest at the end of 2021. “I hope that the French will elect someone who defends the family , Christianity and opposes migration”, declared Viktor Orban, according to an LCI journalist present in Madrid, on the sidelines of a one-on-one with the French deputy, adding: “Marine Le Pen is this kind as a leader, (...) she is highly respected in Hungary”.
23149	27	A good way for the RN candidate to consolidate her international stature and her credibility on her ability to gain power, when she (finally) obtained a loan of 10.6 million euros from a European bank. to be able to carry out his presidential campaign. All that remains is to dispel internal doubts and avoid the saga of defections to France.
2315	1	In Washington, Republicans demand action against Russia
2315	3	The drums of war are sounding in Washington, and Republicans are among the most enthusiastic supporters of military action. Some enthusiastically, almost jubilantly, suggest risking nuclear war.
2315	5	It is no longer the party of Ronald Reagan, which sought to prevent conflicts and especially nuclear conflicts. Nor previous Republicans. During his run for vice-president in 1976, Kansas Senator Robert Dole denounced the “Democratic wars of the 20th century”. Democratic presidents dragged America into World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In retrospect, only World War II seems necessary, and even then the conduct of the Democratic administration before the war, however justified, was misleading and reckless.
2315	7	"Today, the most dangerous place on the planet could be Ukraine. Despite Washington's reckless arrogance that has led successive administrations to lie and expand NATO to Russia's borders, dismember Serbia, stage multiple ""color revolutions"" and promise Ukraine and Georgia's alliance membership, GOP lawmakers are pushing for a direct confrontation with Russia. Most want to send weapons. For example, Republican Mike Turner (R-Ohio) and 14 of his colleagues wrote a letter asking President Joe Biden to provide intelligence and weapons to Ukraine."
2315	9	"Some advocate sending troops. In a letter with Republican Mike Rodgers (R-Al), Turner also advocated that the administration ""deploy a US military presence in the Black Sea to deter a Russian invasion."" Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss) would go much further, proposing “military action” which, he explains, “could mean we stand at bay with our ships in the Black Sea, and rain down the rain.” destruction on Russian military capability. That's not all: ""It could mean that we participate, and I do not exclude it, I do not exclude the presence of American troops on the ground. We do not rule out nuclear action as a first resort. »"
2315	11	Wicker issued a statement saying, “President Biden should clarify that there is no scenario in which Ukraine is invaded by Russia, period. Putin already faces a bloodbath if he attacks Ukrainian troops. President Biden should up the ante by warning that an invasion would expose him to an intolerably high number of Russian casualties. This means leaving all options on the table and making no concessions. »
2315	13	Perhaps Wicker assumes that Putin will back down from such threats. However, Ukraine means much more to Russia and the latter enjoys local military superiority. The “bloodbath” that Wicker would enthusiastically impose on Moscow would also consume American and Ukrainian lives.
2315	15	"Equally irrational was Senator Lindsey Graham's support for nuclear war against North Korea in 2017. Long the loyal sidekick of warmonger John McCain, Graham gravitated to Donald Trump, whom the senator offered ostentatious subservience. This seems to include advocating nuclear war. Speaking of South Korea, Graham explained, “If there is going to be a war to stop [Kim Jong-un], it will be there. If thousands of people die, that's where they will die. they're not going to die here. Graham added, ""And that may be provocative, but not really. When you are President of the United States, where is your allegiance? To the people of the United States. »"
23150	3	Jean-Luc Mélenchon reacted to Emmanuel Macron's first statement after the first round of the legislative elections on Tuesday. He summed up that statement in a “Trump sketch.”
23150	5	"After Emmanuel Macron's statement in front of his plane about to take off, Jean-Luc Mélenchon called the intervention a ""Trump sketch"". “Macron sinks. At the polls, except among those over sixty. In the polls and in authority over his people, the flag is at half mast,” he wrote on his site. “I hardly dare to say that it feels warm, given the temperature. This Trump-style sketch to warn against the enemy within is the symbol of an era”, he still regretted."
23150	7	"Emmanuel Macron indeed called on Tuesday afternoon to ""give him a solid majority"", essential for the implementation of his program for which he was elected. He spoke of “the best interests of the nation”. He summed up this call by asking for a “republican outburst” from the tarmac at Orly airport."
23150	9	A kind of panic that wins Macronie according to Julien Bayou
23150	11	"The secretary general of EELV Julien Bayou also took the floor and spoke of “a kind of panic that is spreading to Macronie”. He repeated once again that ""Emmanuel Macron's mandate did not convince"" and that he had been ""reelected by default""."
23150	13	The ecologist considered that it was “really dangerous that the president finally can say to himself that, if he is beaten, it is the Republic which is beaten. There is something very arrogant there, something very Jupiter”. “It happens to lose elections, and, if obviously LREM is beaten on Sunday, it will only be a defeat” he added. But for Julien Bayou, a defeat of the presidential coalition Together would rather be “good news” “for wages, public services, the climate”.
23151	1	The Macron-Putin duo, between balance of power and pragmatism
23151	3	With Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron has chosen the register of virile friendship, that of endless handshakes, big smiles and compliments. The French president has a completely different relationship with Vladimir Putin, whom he meets Thursday in Saint Petersburg. Between these two, the balance of power is permanent. What pushes them towards each other is first of all the pragmatism of Emmanuel Macron, who wishes to maintain a dialogue with Moscow despite the many points of friction that remain. But also a certain form of respect for a head of state who resembles him in several aspects.
23151	5	"I respect him. I know him. I am lucid. Emmanuel Macron delivered his feelings about Vladimir Poutine frankly to Fox News on April 22. ""He is a very strong man, a strong president,"" he told the American television channel at the time. ""He's strong and smart, but he's not naive. I respect him. I know him. I'm lucid."" A lucidity which should allow, according to the Élysée at the JDD, to ""build"" a real Franco-Russian relationship while keeping ""eyes open"". On the issues that oppose them, such as Syria, Ukraine or the assassination of the former spy Skripal in the United Kingdom, as on their deep political disagreements (the two have a different vision of what a democracy should be) , Emmanuel Macron tries not to stop all discussions with his counterpart. On Thursday, the French president will also have the advantage of being able to find common ground with Vladimir Putin on the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran agreement, which both reject."
23151	7	"Two countries that want to regain greatness. Emmanuel Macron therefore refuses to consider the break with Russia as an option. ""I want to tie Russia to Europe and not let it withdraw into itself,"" he explained to the JDD in early May. This pure pragmatism is coupled with a certain form of respect for Vladimir Putin and his country. ""He was marked by the humiliation born of the events around the fall of the Berlin Wall and the USSR and experienced this period as a wound for his people"", said Emmanuel Macron to the Sunday weekly. ""Putin has a dream to make Russia great again."""
23151	9	I think Macron and Putin can get along very well. Both are very cultured, love history.
23151	11	It is therefore not surprising that the French head of state seeks to forge links with his counterpart by exalting the history of France. When he received him, shortly after his election, it was at Versailles that he welcomed him with great pomp, as if to remind Vladimir Putin that France, too, was great and would like to become so again. .
23151	13	"Macron and Putin can get along well. If there are therefore common points between France and Russia on which the French president can play, there are also some between the two leaders. ""They are similar in the desire to re-enchant the relationship with political leaders and to be part of a long period of their history"", underlines Michel Eltchaninoff, philosopher and specialist in Russia with AFP. Alexandre Orlov, former Russian ambassador to France, also sees some convergences. ""I think Macron and Putin can get along very well. Both are very cultured, love history,"" he told AFP. ""It would be completely normal for Macron to have a better relationship with Putin than Trump, who are two completely different types. Trump is an uncultured, violent, brutal man."""
23151	15	"Never show us weakness against Putin. Still, Putin, for the moment, sees Macron as ""the representative of a collective West"", notes a Russian diplomat in Le Monde. From there to consider him only as a vassal of the United States, there is only one step, which is easily crossed in Moscow. Hence the firmness displayed by the French president, who did not hesitate to openly criticize in front of his counterpart the French antennas of the RT and Sputnik media, financed by the Kremlin. ""We should never be weak against Putin,"" warned Emmanuel Macron when interviewed by Fox News. ""When you're weak, he uses it."" This explains why the head of state has always preferred strong, but frank exchanges with the Russian president, rather than an overplayed friendship like the one he displays with Donald Trump."
23153	1	The gas inflation crisis is far from over – where will prices finally stop?
23153	3	After a single Federal Reserve rate hike of 75 basis points, I notice a tendency for mainstream economists to pull out their crystal ball and predict an almost immediate return to deflationary conditions. According to them, a recession will “balance everything”. I would suggest most of these people keep their crystal ball in their pants; they have been consistently wrong and it is time for them to shut up. If you predicted that inflation would be “transient” last year, you have no right to behave like an economist today.
23153	5	"It will take much more than a semi-aggressive central bank rate hike to end the inflation problem, and when I say ""inflation"" I mean PRICE INFLATION, not just raising the money supply or a bubble in the stock markets. There are far too many financial analysts who don't even grasp what true inflation is."
23153	7	Certain sectors of the economy will indeed experience deflationary pressures. Real GDP, for example, is down. Retail sales are down. American wages are stagnating relative to prices. Home sales are plummeting. The manufacturing industry is down. Yet prices remain high. It is clear that there is a mixture of inflationary and deflationary elements within the same economic crisis. In other words, it is stagflation.
23153	9	Energy is an area in which prices continue to climb without much respite. The mainstream media attributes this situation almost entirely to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the evolving sanctions on Russian oil and natural gas. However, gas prices were already rising long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Inflation across the economy hit its highest level in 40 years long before Ukraine became a problem, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted last week.
23153	11	Let's not pretend that we don't know the cause of all this. It is caused by the printing of fiat money by the Federal Reserve since 2008, and central banks in general are the culprits. Bankers can finance or refuse to finance whatever they want. Government politicians play their part in creating inflation by DEMANDING the money, but it is the Fed that decides if it creates the money. The government has no power to dictate policy to the Fed; as Alan Greenspan once admitted, the Fed answers to no one.
23153	13	The central bank could print until the end of time if it wanted to, and it basically did. That said, our current crisis has more to it than excess dollars. There is also the matter of supply chain disruptions.
23153	15	I particularly remember the threat of stagflation in the 1970s. The oil and stagflation crisis of the late 1970s happened just before I was born, so obviously I can't directly report what it was, but when I study the events that preceded it, I find many similarities with the situation we face today. However, the crisis that is currently developing has the potential to become much worse.
23153	17	In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon, at the behest of central bankers, removed the dollar from the last vestiges of the gold standard. Central banks abandoned gold as the main mechanism of exchange between governments and began to turn to special drawing rights, the IMF's currency basket system. Predictably, the dollar immediately began to spiral and its purchasing power began to plummet. Stagflation became a household concern throughout the 1970s.
23153	19	This problem eventually subsided with the rise of the dollar's global reserve status. In fact, we've exported a lot of our dollars overseas for use in global trade, and by extension, we've also exported a lot of our inflation/stagflation. As long as the dollar remained the primary reserve currency, most of the consequences of central bank fiat printing were not felt by the general public. In terms of gasoline, the dollar has been the petro-currency for decades, which has allowed us to keep prices in the United States lower than in many countries.
23153	21	But things are changing. The dollar's share of global trade has been declining for several years, and the Fed continues to create greenbacks out of thin air. In 2020 alone, the Fed conjured up $6 trillion to fuel the stimulus response to the Covid crisis, pumping all of that money directly into the system through Covid checks and PPP loans. For this process to continue, the percentage of global dollar trade would need to continue to grow in order to export US inflation abroad. This is not the case. The share of the dollar in world trade is reversing.
23153	23	We are dealing with the end of a cycle that began in the 1970s. We are returning to the initial problem.
23153	25	In addition, the gas crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s was also caused by the Iranian revolution and the withdrawal of Iranian oil supplies from the world market. This caused a loss of about 7% of total oil in the markets, but it caused gas prices to skyrocket from 65 cents in 1978 to $1.35 in 1981. Prices more than doubled within three years and have never returned to their pre-crisis level.
23153	27	As in the late 1970s, we also have a supply chain problem with an OPEC country. Russia's share of world oil production was around 10% in 2020, but the country is the second largest oil exporter in the world. Only 3% of oil imported into the United States comes from Russia, but Europe depends on Russia for about 25% of its total oil consumption.
23153	29	The EU is supposed to cut off this oil supply, although there are questions about the gaps and how much Russian oil is actually continuing to be supplied to European nations. With continued sanctions, the EU will have to look to other exporters to get what it needs, reducing the amount of oil available to Western countries. The Russians have simply adapted and are now selling more oil at a discount to major eastern markets like China and India. But for the rest of us, Europe's thirst for oil will continue to drive prices higher as supply dwindles.
23153	31	So where does this leave us? Our situation is similar to the gas crisis of the late 1970s, as we face permanent stagflation, a weakening currency and a major economic dispute with an OPEC producer [OPEC+ in done with Russia, NdT]. That said, the situation is much more serious than in the 1970s for several reasons, including the fact that our country is much more indebted, that foreign assets in dollars and currencies are in decline and that the conflict with Russia is much more serious than our problems with Iran in the 1970s.
23153	33	I think we're going to see at least a 300% increase in the price of gasoline from the pre-pandemic low of about $2.60 per gallon for regular gasoline. In other words, prices will continue to climb during this year and stabilize around $7.50 per gallon by the second quarter of 2023. I am basing the pace of price increase on that which took place between 1979 and 1981.
23153	35	Obviously, there will be dips and breaks in the market, but we are unlikely to see a dramatic drop in prices at the pump any time soon. The mainstream media will keep predicting when inflation will stop and many pundits will argue that the Fed will soon capitulate on rate hikes. All of this clamor will affect oil markets to some extent, but prices will continue to rise regardless.
23153	37	Some will say that falling demand will stop rising prices, but the problem of stagflation doesn't just revolve around demand, there are many other factors at play. Unless we see a fall in demand similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic lockdowns, there is unlikely to be a significant reversal.
23153	39	Also, for anyone hoping for the US shale plays or OPEC to take over from Russia, that's not going to happen. Oil industry experts have already noted that due to inflation and lack of manpower, there will not be a major increase in oil pumping and therefore shortages will continue for some time.
23153	41	What does this mean for the economy in general? Inflation of basic necessities like gasoline means an implosion of retail. People will divert funds from other purchases to cover gas and energy costs. Expensive gasoline also means high freight rates, which means higher prices for everything else on store shelves. High gasoline prices will also cause small transportation companies to go bankrupt or close, along with much higher interest rates instituted by the Fed. My own grandfather lost his trucking and haulage business in the 1970s for this exact reason.
23153	43	In turn, less freight means less supply, which in turn means higher prices on everything. It's a terrible cycle. The thing is, you should expect gas prices to stay very high (up to $7 a gallon) over the next year, and that will affect EVERYTHING else in terms of wallet and life. . Don't give too much importance to people who claim that deflation is on the way; this is not the case for the prices of basic necessities.
23153	45	Ultimately, the lack of demand will slow the rise in prices, but not before we have passed the current national average of $5 per gallon. And if you live in a state with high gas taxes, like California, prepare for double-digit costs at the pump.
23155	1	Mike Pompeo's revealing speech on the nature of the American empire (Caitlin Johnstone)
23155	3	Pompeo is a Distinguished Fellow at The Hudson Institute until the revolving door of the Washington swamp allows him to return to a position in the federal government. The Hudson Institute is a neoconservative think tank that has a high degree of overlap with the infamous Project for the New American Century and its architects of the Iraq War, and spends much of its time manufacturing support for the Beltway for warmongering programs against Iran. It was founded in 1961 with the help of a cold warrior named Herman Kahn, whose enthusiastic support that the United States can win a nuclear war with the Soviet Union is said to have inspired the movie Dr Strangelove.
23155	5	A think tank is an institution where scholars are paid by the worst people in the world to come up with explanations of why it would be good and smart to do something bad and stupid, which is then presented to points of influence media and government keys. The term “think tank” is a good term for these institutions, because they are dedicated to monitoring what people think, and because they are artificial enclosures for slimy creatures.
23155	7	"Pompeo's speech is a long rimjob for the military-industrial complex that indirectly employs him. He never ceases to sing the praises of the weapons that are dumped in Ukraine, two of which are namely: the Patriot missile manufactured by Raytheon and the Javelin missile manufactured jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, both of which are major donors to the Institute. Hudson. He repeatedly denounces the ""disastrous pullout from Afghanistan"" and accuses the Biden administration of failing to control the world's fossil fuel resources aggressively enough in its efforts to ""bow down to the radicals."""
23155	9	"Pompeo, easily ranked among the most bigoted imperialists on the entire planet, hilariously declares that “China's Belt and Road Initiative is a form of imperialism. He decries a ""genocide"" in Xinjiang and repeatedly implies that China deliberately unleashed Covid-19 on the world, calling it ""the China-induced global pandemic."" He repeatedly asserts that Vladimir Putin is trying to reconstitute the Soviet Union."
23155	11	"While praising NATO and the various anti-China alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, Pompeo points to ""Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan"" as ""the three beacons of freedom"" that these alliances must embrace. strive to support militarily. You will notice that these three “beacons” happen to be the hottest points of the geostrategic conflict with the three main adversaries of the American empire: Russia, Iran and China."
23155	13	But there are a couple of things Pompeo says that are really interesting.
23155	15	“By helping Ukraine, we prevented the creation of a Russian-Chinese axis determined to exercise military and economic hegemony in Europe, Asia and the Middle East,” Mr. Pompeo said.
23155	17	“We must prevent the formation of a pan-Eurasian colossus incorporating Russia, but led by China,” he adds then. “For that, we need to strengthen NATO, and we see that nothing stands in the way of Finland and Sweden joining this organization. »
23155	19	Ultimately, that's what today's big international news is all about. Underlying all the petty reports about conflicts with nations like Russia, China and Iran is an ongoing story about the US power alliance trying to secure planetary dominance by working tirelessly. to subvert any nation that refuses to align itself with it, and the nations that oppose this campaign by working against it with increasing intimacy.
23155	21	That's been the whole point of Russian hysteria since 2016. That's all the phony, hypocritical crying over Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong has been. That's all the staged human rights histrions in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Cuba have represented. It was about manufacturing international consent for an increasingly dangerous campaign to secure unipolar global hegemony at all costs.
23155	23	"It bears repeating, as NATO names China a threat for the first time because of its alignment with Russia and NATO's Secretary General admits that NATO is preparing for conflict with Russia since 2014. It should be recalled that since the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States has implemented a policy aimed at preventing the rise of any rival superpower and refusing any serious challenge to its planetary domination. It is worth recalling that in 1997, the precursor to the US Space Force pledged to work towards ""full-spectrum dominance"", i.e. military control over the land, sea, air and space."
23155	25	People love to talk about secret conspiracies by shadow cabals to establish a one world government, but what is by far the most tangible and imminent agenda for world domination has been orchestrated out in the open. The US government has long sought to unify the world under a single power structure, regardless of the violence and devastation it must inflict on humanity and regardless of the nuclear threat it must engage to achieve this.
23155	27	It is the American empire that corrupt psychopaths like Mike Pompeo support. A power structure that waged incessant wars in order to maintain peace, that continually oppressed people around the world in order to protect freedom, and that risked nuclear war through increasingly reckless aggression in order to save the world.
23155	29	Translation of CaitlinJohnstone.com by Aube Digitale
23156	2	The UK has confirmed the launch of a new training program for thousands of Ukrainian soldiers on its soil, which must last at least several weeks for each batch of recruits.
23156	4	Although Britain was one of the first countries to make major arms deliveries to kyiv in the days and weeks after Russia invaded the country on February 24, the details of the scope of this new training program takes the proxy war nature of the conflict to a whole new level – although Western officials have long rejected the proxy war label. On Saturday, the Guardian gave details based on statements by the MoD:
23156	6	Up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers will arrive in the UK for several weeks of specialized military training. The first cohort met Defense Secretary Ben Wallace on Thursday, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) confirmed.
23156	8	The ambitious program is seen as the next phase of London's support for Ukraine at a tumultuous time when Boris Johnson is about to leave after stepping down as prime minister. It is well known that Britain and the United States have already trained thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in previous years, since 2014 and the start of the Donbass conflict.
23156	10	"Defense Secretary Ben Wallace announced: ""Using the world-class expertise of the British military, we will help Ukraine rebuild its forces and step up its resistance as it defends the sovereignty of its country and its right to choose its own future. »"
23156	12	One detail that underlines the enormous and unprecedented scale of the program is the number of British military personnel, many of them special forces, who will be needed to oversee the training of Ukrainians. This after the UK has already given £2.3bn in aid to Ukraine's defense forces since the start of the war.
23156	14	“Around 1,050 UK military personnel are deployed to manage the programme, which will take place at four undisclosed Ministry of Defense sites in the North West, South West and South East of the UK,” the Guardian reveals. .
23156	16	Defense Chief Benn Wallace visits a training site:
23156	18	It is also worth noting that the Ukrainians are largely volunteers who have no prior formal military training, strongly suggesting growing concern and alarm over the rate of Ukrainian troop losses, after officials in Kyiv admitted a month ago that they were losing around 200 people a day to the Russian onslaught.
23156	20	“The training will give volunteer recruits with little or no military experience the skills to be effective in frontline combat,” the Guardian report further details. “Based on basic British soldier training, the course covers weapons handling, battlefield first aid, field manoeuvre, patrol tactics and the law of armed conflict. »
23156	22	Despite Moscow arguably seeing this as a huge provocation and escalation of British involvement in the war, the UK MoD is surprisingly open and cheeky about the training, even inviting news crews to join in. film a game in a secret location:
23156	24	This first group of Ukrainian fighters is believed to have arrived in the UK a few days ago, at a time when Ukrainian forces appear to be slowly retreating in the Donbass – and now that Luhansk province is fully under Russian control – the lines of front being constantly pounded by Russia's superior artillery.
23156	26	"US and UK officials have recently made provocative calls for an ""insurgency"" in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, particularly in the east. For example, last Thursday US Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) visited the Ukrainian capital and met with President Zelensky. Blumenthal announced that he hoped to see a ""hand-to-hand insurgency"" in the territory Russia captured."
23156	28	“Long-range artillery is very, very important. But so is the hand-to-hand insurgency that we hope to see in eastern Ukraine, in territory that was once occupied by the Russians,” Blumenthal said. In light of new revelations from the UK Ministry of Defense about the scale of its training program in Ukraine, a central question remains: Is this new large-scale training program hosted in Britain preparing to fuel such an insurrection scenario? Given the “willing combatant” nature of the program, it seems so.
23158	3	During the NATO summit, the President of the United States was asked about the high fuel prices in the United States and around the world. This will last, according to him, until the United States has achieved its goal in Ukraine. Following the NATO summit in Madrid on June 30, United States President Joe Biden was questioned at a press conference on the record rise in fuel prices observed in the United States and in many countries. , linked in particular to the effects of the conflict in Ukraine.
23158	5	"Thus, Jim Tankersley, correspondent for the daily newspaper The New York Times asked him: “The war has pushed up prices, they could go up to 200 dollars a barrel, according to certain analysts. How long is it fair to expect motorists in America and around the world to pay this hike for this war?” “As long as it takes until Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine,” replied Joe Biden. And, while gasoline in the United States reached a historic record close to 5 dollars (4.80 euros) for a gallon (3.79 liters), the president tried to explain his bill to reduce fuel taxes that he calculates could lower the price at the pump by about a dollar a gallon: ""If we do these things...if Congress agrees and the states agree , we could lower the price of oil by about $1 a gallon at the pump, within that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of a reduction in the temporary elimination of the gas tax.” Then he added, quoted by the reference site on energy in the United States oilprice.com: ""And so, I think that there are many things that we can do, and we will do it, but in the end After all, the reason gasoline prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia!”"
23159	1	Ukraine/European Union: towards European geopolitical suicide
23159	3	Beyond the harmful effects of the sanctions against Russia for European economies, the emotional and ideological position of the EU regarding the war in Ukraine is above all a real geostrategic disaster, believes Roland Lombardi. There is no need to go back to the devastating boomerang effect for its own economy, of the sanctions voted by the European Union against Russia. They did nothing to stop the Ukrainian conflict or weaken Vladimir Putin. Instead, they reinforce it. Worse, they are aggravating the socio-economic crises in Europe, to which are now added a shortage of gas and a lasting energy crisis of which the peoples of Europe are already the first and main victims. In the end, the Pavlovian alignment of the Europeans with NATO war logic and their irresponsible and chaotic economic war against Russia is pushing the Old Continent towards disaster. With this doodle policy, the EU is already losing one of its main trading partners.
23159	4	Moreover, by setting aside diplomacy and taking up the cause of the Ukrainian government, while campaigning for the integration of new countries, moreover neutral ones, such as Finland and Sweden within the Atlanticist organization and above all by granting the official candidate status of Ukraine and Moldova for entry into the Union, a process which is not certain to succeed, the geostrategic break with Russia has been consummated. However, this goes against common sense and any reasonable geopolitical vision.
23159	6	"The famous Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote already in the 6th century BC: “In the affairs of a state, one never undertakes an action which does not correspond to the interests of one's country”. Later, Richelieu, the inventor of the expression “reason of state”, invited us as for him, to always make the difference between private morality and public morality. Foreign policy must be strictly based on ""the calculation of forces and the national interest"" as Henry Kissinger, the father of modern Realpolitik, reminded us. In short, States must remain “cold monsters”. However, whether we like it or not, Ukraine has no vital interest for Europe. The Nord Stream 1 and especially Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines (put on hold at the start of the conflict!) were precisely intended to double the gas transport capacity to Europe by bypassing Ukraine, until then a traditional country of transit . Let us never forget that the United States has been largely responsible, for 25 years, for the current situation. Henry Kissinger always reminded us: “We have made no serious effort to associate Russia with a new security architecture in Europe”. Washington never really sought to take advantage, in the early 2000s, and during his first mandates, of Vladimir Putin's intentions to open up to Europe and the West. The Russian president was even thinking, at the time, of joining the Atlantic Alliance with the hope of redefining the role of NATO or creating “a new entity in which Russia would become an equal partner”. Instead, the shadow of the Democratic and viscerally anti-Russian thinker Brzeziński and the neoconservatives will always hang over US policy vis-à-vis Moscow. Oral promises about NATO's non-enlargement to the east have been brushed aside. And ten Eastern European countries will join the Alliance, thus bringing its bases and its troops to the current borders of Russia, which legitimately sees this as a provocation and a manifest desire for encirclement."
23159	8	"Therefore, the American strategy is clear: multiply new customers for its powerful military-industrial complex since European countries prefer American protection and buy American equipment rather than European (and French in this case!); and make Russia the ideal bogeyman in order to prevent at all costs a possible ""alliance"" between a ""Europe of Nations"" and Russia (""From Brest to Vladivostok""), which would then have been a much greater threat than China for the United States and its global hegemony. Similarly, Russia is in no way an existential danger to Europeans. Today for Europeans, Putin is Hitler, as Atlanticist propaganda tells us. This comparison is ridiculous. Hitler wanted to impose his ideology on the world (like the communists for that matter). He wanted to create a Nazi Europe and had a policy of conquest for his ""living space"". The Russia of today has nothing to do with the USSR of yesterday, which also had views on Western Europe. Putin has no ideology to inflict or living space to conquer. He himself declared, and this on several occasions, that between Moscow and Vladivostok, there were 9,000 kilometers and that Russia had other plans than to invade the Baltic countries (members of NATO moreover !). Be serious ! Currently, we are no longer in the time of great conquests and great invasions. The Soviet Union has also known the price to pay during an occupation of a third and hostile country such as in Afghanistan. The Ukrainian affair, even if the Russians have demonstrated in recent weeks that they have learned from their initial mistakes and that they have successfully updated and readjusted their strategy in the east of the country, must surely have stung the Kremlin about this kind of adventure... Admittedly, Russian propaganda and soft power have always been very active, but the Kremlin is playing its part and is only looking to find business partners or even new customers in the economic sense as Roman… Finally like the Westerners or the Chinese! European blindness As serious geostrategists remind us, not subject to the Atlanticist doxa, Russia could nevertheless become a partner or even a precious ally in the face of the real geopolitical issues of Europe and the immense challenges of tomorrow in the Mediterranean, the border largest in the Old Continent, and therefore in Africa or the Middle East. In reality, Europeans do not know how to define the real enemy. Fatal error in international relations. However, there are four real and major geopolitical dangers threatening Europe: China, which through its predatory economic hegemony threatens our independence and our industrial sovereignty (we have seen this with the pandemic), the migratory crises and the Islamism, which threatens the cohesion of European societies from within, and finally, progressive ideology and all its failings (acculturation, wokism, etc.), which dangerously accentuates the gap between the European peoples and their elites. However, European leaders are still in denial and still prefer to attack Putin's Russia, which they loathe for ideological and moral reasons, to the detriment of Realpolitik. By sacrificing their own security, strategic, energy and economic interests in the process. In his time and rightly, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, in a pure Gaullist vision, had defended a relative European energy dependence vis-à-vis Russia, which would then have spared us from another, more perverse, dependence on much more hostile countries to which we now turn desperately (Algeria, Qatar, Azerbaijan…) in our desperate quest for an alternative to Russian gas! The Europeans also quickly forgot the objective but effective alliance of the Russians against Daesh, Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, Libya and elsewhere, in the southern Mediterranean and in the Middle East. Worse, today Brussels is rehabilitating and leaving the most beautiful role to Erdoğan's Turkey which is still, however, with Qatar, the last support of radical Islamism. Also forgotten is the illegal Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus since 1974, such as Ankara's threats in recent years to Greece and even French buildings in the eastern Mediterranean! There is really only Emmanuel Macron to still boast of an alleged ""European sovereignty"". As we have seen, this is not about to really exist. In the end, the real problem of Europe and surely its main threat, even before those we have just listed, is perhaps simply its technocratic ruling class, disconnected from reality and Manichean. What to expect from European politicians hostages of the Atlanticist “deep states” and entangled in conflicts of personal interest with the Anglo-Saxon or Chinese “powers of money”. Real little Washington telegraphers and irresponsible boy scouts who, through their inconsistency, their suicidal hysteria and their mad ideology, want, as Henri Guaino and Pierre Lellouche so rightly remind us, to lead us like the sleepwalkers of 1914 towards a third war world!"
2316	1	Economy: Nothing is going well in France and in the EU!
2316	3	In an excellent column in Le Figaro, Christian Saint-Étienne remarks that distributing purchasing power, without productive counterpart, is to prepare a Greek scenario! Macron, Marine le Pen and Mélenchon have nevertheless embarked on a mad demagogic race to attract voters, one of the mortal wounds of Western democracies!
2316	5	"The problem is that France no longer manufactures enough industrial products and has an annual trade deficit of around 100 billion euros! The public deficit is now flirting with 6.5% of GDP! Growth is plummeting, was zero at the beginning of 2022 to reach at best 1.3% in 2023 and 1.1% in 2024! There is even more and more talk of recession and “stagflation”, following the stupid anti-Russian suicidal sanctions which will first hit “those who smoke cigarettes and drive diesel”! French industry is crumbling under social charges and production taxes to pay crazy public spending with 2 million too many civil servants, an annual cost of immigration of 84 billion euros per year and a deficit pension system! The employment created by the ""high tech"" of the manipulator Macron is better than nothing, but only 1% of employment in France: this cannot replace the gigantic investments of Tesla and Intel in Germany and real factories to manufacture essential goods imported from China and emerging countries!"
2316	6	Economy: Nothing is going well in France and in the EU!
2316	8	Christian Saint-Étienne reminds us of the Tsipras syndrome in Greece which would consist in France of electing the deputies of a party demanding the distribution of purchasing power while borrowing it, a minimum wage of 5,000 euros, a pension of 50 years, to bring us in the three months following their election, with the rise in interest rates, a crisis of confidence in the System, the collapse of the economy, retirement at 68 and a 20% reduction in pensions! Demagogic promises that are impossible to keep are binding only on the naive and the morons who listen to them. Tomorrow we shave for free!
2316	10	It is also the rout in the EU since it renounces until 2023 the stability pact with a maximum debt of 60% of GDP and a deficit of less than 3% of GDP, due to the war in Ukraine. The EU is renouncing the takeover of public finances. 17 countries do not respect the deficit criterion and five, including France, the debt criterion. The pact should be reactivated only in 2024! The pacifist, right-of-human, mercantile and immigrationist EU, in love with a sudden war madness against Russia, is going through a period of the most total economic uncertainty.
2316	12	In Italy Mario Draghi no longer knows the state of grace. Growth should not exceed 2.4% this year and 1.9% in 2023. Tax and competition reforms appear to be stalled. Debts will continue to rise and what will Draghi do but announce Italy's bankruptcy if rates rise?
2316	13	As for the euro zone, it is torn: the debt gap between Germany and Italy has more than doubled in ten years and reached 90% of GDP, against 45% between France and Germany. But rates are rising! Christine Lagarde of the ECB wants to end the asset purchase program in July. In addition, the current negative rate of -0.50% should drop to 0% in September, following two successive increases of 0.25% in July and September. Christine Lagarde, at the end of last year, however, considered a rate hike unlikely in 2022 because the deposit rate has been in negative territory since 2014!
2316	15	The problem is that the consumer price index in the eurozone reached a record high of 7.4% year on year in April; even excluding food and energy, inflation is well above the 2% target set by the ECB. In fact, Christine Lagarde is completely confused, expresses herself in incomprehensible grandiloquent gibberish while speaking of gradualism, optionality, flexibility and adjustment of monetary policy according to unforeseeable events to come. Christine Lagarde actually recognizes that the situation is getting more and more out of control and that she does not know where she is going! It seems that it is towards the catastrophe and the explosion of the euro zone!
2316	17	The stupid policy of economic and financial sanctions against Russia is the icing on the cake which is making the situation worse! In the event of an oil embargo, Russia could very easily replace European demand with that of India and China. On the other hand, the embargo will lead to an unacceptable increase in prices at the pump for yellow vests! Potential oil suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, Brazil, the United States are reluctant because if they increase their production, Russia will slash prices, as it has already done with India at 25 dollars per barrel, and they will lose! In addition, transport costs will be much higher than for Russian oil. Finally, Russian oil is of superior quality to produce middle distillates (diesel) in European refineries.
2316	19	As far as gas is concerned, a big producing country such as Qatar does not want to sell all its gas to Germany because if Berlin decides to stop its orders, it will be trapped. Chancellor Olaf Scholz very naively made the rounds of meals in Africa (Senegal and South Africa) to wean himself off Russian gas and find new suppliers, but he came up short with random, too expensive futuristic projects.
2316	21	Outside Europe, the situation is not bright in the United States (high inflation, weak growth, rising interest rates and small successive stock market crashes), but it is also worrying, which is new, on the side of the China! In May, the Middle Kingdom unveiled its worst economic performance for two years, with consumption at its lowest and unemployment close to an all-time high. According to the UBS bank, Chinese growth could be limited to 3% this year, while Beijing clings to its target of 5.5%. The “Zero Covid” strategy is proving catastrophic for many sectors, including the luxury sector, with a 47% collapse in sales compared to 2021. We are witnessing a plunge in housing starts and housing sales. Credit production was twice lower than expected; retail sales have fallen by 11% and the consumer price index is above expectations. If containment seems to be easing in Shanghai, the city of Beijing is strengthening its anti-covid measures, with many shops and tourist sites closed or idling. From Davos, the director of the IMF speaks of “headwinds” in China.
2316	23	As for “cryptos”, Christine Lagarde believes that “it is worth nothing and that it is not based on anything”. The Banque de France evokes the famous speculative tulip bubble in Holland in the 17th century and compares the bitcoin phenomenon to “tulipomania”. The American Central Bank also wants to whistle the end of recess. The cryptocurrency market has already lost more than half of its value, dropping from $3 trillion to $1.4 trillion in just six months. For Bitcoin with a record price of $66,000, and a current price of $29,000, the drop today is 57%! Some investors believe it could even tumble to $8,000, just like the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000. When will stocks and bonds turn if interest rates soar?
2316	25	Jane Fraser, CEO of the major American bank Citi, is convinced in Davos that Europe will enter a recession! Viktor Orban has decreed a curfew in Hungary and believes that we are going to have to face a serious economic crisis. There is even a risk of a global recession with an increase in unemployment, food prices, public and private debt which is already too high in the world.
23162	3	Macron is the enemy of France and the French in the enchanted universe of taxes and duties.
23162	5	His world as a small banker is the world of media spectacle where everyone behaves like an irresponsible prevaricator of public money, in other words other people's money. It is the tax fight which is Macron's hard drug in the form of a hallucinogenic mushroom which was enough for the revolt of the Yellow Vests.
23162	7	The hard drug of Macron's taxation is a dangerous product. Consequently, with the proliferation of taxes and duties, but not for all, poverty for all French people must be imposed on all.
23162	9	Macron today is the gravedigger of France in the cottages, even in the morgue.
23162	11	Clearly, when the fiscal terrorism of Macron enlightened is En Marche, individual freedom is extinguished.
23162	13	Thanks to Macron, France and the French will not have waited long for the confiscation of French money for tax acceleration in order to increase the increase in compulsory levies.
23162	15	This is why Macron did not even express a desire to know whether the enchanted universe of taxes and levies was a suitable political measure to preserve the purchasing power of the French. Clearly, he threatens the French with the bureaucrats of Bercy with the line of sight tax racketeering and the suppression of the savings of the poorest French people. We may know that a lie about the enchanted universe of taxes and duties, Macron's mismanagement cannot justify the tax racket organized by Macron the little investment banker. Macron President would he hold money placed in a tax haven? The journalists of L'Huma, Jean-Baptiste Rivoire and Gauthier Mesrnier, suspect that part of his remuneration by the Rothschild bank, in 2012, would have been paid into a trust abroad! This is why the investigation of L'Huma casts suspicion on the heritage of Emmanuel Macron officially declared by the candidate Macron for the presidential election of 2022.
23162	17	No one can forget the distance separating Macron, the little political investment banker, from the real world and the needs of the real French, worsening taxism, unemployment and Islamism.
23162	19	Macron, the small investment banker of the Rothschild bank, came to earth from a star far from the concrete life of the French invaded by migrants and who find it difficult to survive and find accommodation in the real country. This is why the living-togetherphobia of the French will develop without hope of improvement.
23162	21	The case of Macron, who came to earth from a star far from reality and the life of the French, is no different from that of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's Little Prince. The Francophobic dreams of Macron, the petty political investment banker, should be in children's books. Macron should ask forgiveness for forgetting that he is addressing poor grown-ups and not ignorant children.
23162	23	Macron as a teenager, the little investment banker, should be a grown-up who lives in France where he plays the role of the president of all French people. This is why France really needs to be consoled.
23162	25	But all the excuses of Macron as a teenager will not be enough to calm the spirits, because his politics in the form of childishness cannot make us forget that Macron remains a child who plays Macron President.
23162	27	"Macron as a child saw an image in a book about the Virgin Forest called ""Lived Stories""."
23162	29	It depicted a boa snake swallowing a beast. “Boa snakes (En Marche) swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. Then they can no longer move and they sleep for the six months of their digestion” (The Little Prince). Since then, Macron has lived in the imaginary world of his tax obsessions. It is above the turpitudes of the common people, away from the difficulties of the real French.
23162	31	This is why he wants to swallow the savings of poor French people like his prey whole, without chewing it. Then he doesn't want to move, he does nothing, and he sleeps for the five years of his digestion.
23162	33	Macron cannot reassure anyone by worrying everyone and harassing everyone.
23162	35	His obsession with taxation for all the poor and middle classes is both insistent and clumsy. This is another bad blow from Macron to working France.
23162	37	And zero risk does not exist for Macron in the 2022 elections, not even in his dreams!
23162	39	Macron wants to impose a more chaste energy conduct, which is pure puritanism!
23162	41	Heating is a tolerance that will soon be accompanied by the Soviet obligation to give up heating. With Macron, the confusion has become total between taxes and the price of energy.
23162	43	With Macron, energy terrorism promises the worst of the Covid 19 pandemic.
23162	45	How many new restrictions will be needed to reverse the natural trend of energy speculation? Macron can dream of a society without heating for others. He is one of those people who are superiorly authorized by law to harass working France and to “piss off” the French (Pompidou dixit). From all sides, Macron attacks and fiscally harasses working France and poor pensioners with the CSG of shame. With Macron as a teenager, the little investment banker, you are condemned, you are taxed and you are deprived of all forms of normal life and having to count the slightest euro.
23162	47	#RothschildGate: Macron, the small investment banker of the Rothschild bank, would have stashed his remuneration via an account located in a tax haven. Source WikiStrike.
23162	49	After the already colossal first scandal of #McKinseyGate, here are journalists from L'Humanité swinging another money affair concerning the real heritage of Emmanuel Macron, which would not be only 500K as he declared to the HATVP, and which surprised the French, but rather several million euros stashed in a safe place. Indeed, disturbing elements suggest that during his time at the Rothschild bank, Macron would have been paid via an account located in a tax haven, this is what the investigation by L'Huma tends to show (source : WikiStrike).
23162	51	Macron as a teenager, the little investment banker, does not take into account what the real French people think. Courage and rebellion are on their side. Not only does Macron not work for the reconciliation of the French with power, but he is also not afraid to harass people with all kinds of inappropriate decisions. As luck would have it, Macron was elected by the McKinsey campaign team, which releases him from all obligations. As Éric Zemmour puts it so well: Macron as a teenager, France's best enemy...
23162	53	Macron guignol LGBT has nothing to do at the Élysée. He is no longer at home. His house is the PS.
23162	55	Morality, with Zemmour: We must regain control of our country!
23163	1	Macron is this man who speaks to us about Europe with the same fervor as if he speaks to us about a Reich which must last 1000 years
23163	3	Some excerpts:
23163	5	I'll start with this table made by 1 in 5 regarding child protection. Because I find that it has not really been discussed in this presidential election.
23163	7	Emmanuel Macron is one of the few candidates who did not answer these questions and the only one who ignored the request. Among the candidates interviewed, Marine Le Pen is the only one with Jean-Luc Mélenchon to have responded favorably to all points. This means that the only candidate in the second round who has a specific program for child protection is Marine Le Pen. It could have been Jean-Luc Mélenchon, but the ballot meant that Marine Le Pen was in the second round.
23163	9	[…] The recognition of traumatic amnesia is the recognition that a victim can develop amnesia of what they have experienced as a mechanism of resilience and survival. In fact outside of the child protection framework, traumatic amnesia is precisely what is happening right now. Emmanuel Macron's five-year term has been extremely violent, and certain resilience mechanisms sometimes work against us: such as tetanization or traumatic amnesia. The problem with traumatic amnesia is that it competes with limitation periods and plays against the victims for the benefit of the executioners.
23163	11	[…] In this questionnaire of 1 out of 5, the Romeo and Juliet amendment in question is, according to the Huffington Post, “a provision, provided for by the Keeper of the Seals Éric Dupond-Moretti, [aiming] to preserve love teenagers”. Behind this expression “adolescent love” hides the fact of not considering it a crime for an adult to have a sexual relationship with a minor whose age difference is up to 5 years. And this expression of “adolescent loves” is quite problematic because it supports the idea of ​​an adolescent initiation necessary for the commercialization of sex for the benefit of adults.
23163	13	Some answered the questionnaire, some declined, Emmanuel Macron is the only one who ignored.
23163	15	"In my 2017 article I wrote that the 24-year-old relationship between Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron began when he was only 15 years old. I was worried about the consequences of this imbalance, especially in his ability to lie, and we saw him say everything and its opposite with his famous “at the same time”. I had also written that Emmanuel Macron is ""not capable of discerning the right from the unfair"", and I had written that he ""knows how to discern the profit, but not the good"". And his five-year term confirmed it."
23163	17	In this lack of response from Emmanuel Macron to the one in five questionnaire, we find this inability to position ourselves, we find this sadly famous “at the same time”. […]
23163	19	"The ""at the same time"" is seen in all aspects of Emmanuel Macron's life"", and ""at the same time"" there is a cuckold. According to the authorized biographies of Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, Brigitte's infidelity devastated her husband André-Louis so much that he didn't even go to his own mother's funeral."
23163	21	I wrote in 2017 that Emmanuel Macron is a man who cannot say no to a woman who wants to destroy her family and destroy her husband. And Emmanuel Macron is definitely the one who cannot say no to a Europe that wants to destroy France. And the cuckold is us.
23163	23	And before returning to the scarecrows agitated by Emmanuel Macron and his apostles, I will dwell on the question of disability. While the second round opposes Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen in the second round, the rebellious voters are divided. These days leaked the recording of a “space”, a space for vocal discussion, where we can hear some committed personalities such as a famous columnist from Mediapart who expresses his “real anxiety” that people do not vote Macron, unashamedly feeding a rather incredible form of delirium by ticking all the boxes of racist discourse while another person begins to fear for the disabled.
23163	25	[…] So if we find there the usual scarecrows that are usually debited in front of the National Front then in front of the National Rally, the cognitive dissonance becomes ridiculous when we think of the thousands of imprisoned yellow vests, the yellow vests from whom it was withdrawn civil rights and therefore the right to vote, to journalists who were taken on like criminals when they weren't being shot. But above all, I was very surprised to hear this woman say that she is worried about the consequences of a possible election of Marine Le Pen for the disabled.
23163	27	[…] If Marine Le Pen's party is a complex party, I find it difficult to see the fear that one can have concerning this part of the program for people with disabilities. I am talking about various currents in the Rassemblement National party, but if there is one current that is very strong in this party today, it is this awareness of disability, of related needs, and of this desire to improve the current situation.
23163	29	[…] People who are directly affected by the disability will naturally protect their family so they will not highlight their personal involvement, but I realized that in Marine Le Pen's immediate entourage, among her advisers, closer, there are people who experience disability on a daily basis, who know what it is to welcome the news of a child whose disability marks the entire body of the child. In Marine Le Pen's campaign team there are people who have accepted and welcomed a disabled child and certain points of this brochure correspond 100% to personal experiences lived in the immediate entourage of the candidate of the National Rally.
23163	31	I will have more difficulty judging the other promises of this party, frankly, but on these particular points relating to disability, I know that the person who wrote this brochure experiences these things personally, and these points, at least these points are not bluff.
23163	33	The biggest risk of these promises not being kept is obviously that this party does not win the second round, but if it were to win the second round, the biggest risk of these promises not being kept would be the fact that the deputies La République En Marche opposes the fulfillment of these promises.
23163	35	[…] You noticed that the vaccination pass was suspended and not withdrawn during the elections. This vaccine pass is still in effect, it is only temporarily suspended for part of the population, and if you are not affected by the vaccine pass today, you are privileged and it is only temporary. There are still people today subject to the vaccination pass in France, who have been deprived of the ability to do their job and who do not receive their remuneration. Jean-Luc Mélenchon had promised to come back to this past, Marine Le Pen had promised to come back to this past, Emmanuel Macron maintains it.
23163	37	The New York Times revealed on April 14 that European countries are temporarily postponing the implementation of new embargoes on petroleum products for fear that this will cause Emmanuel Macron to lose his election. They know that a rise in fuel prices would be fatal to Emmanuel Macron, so they lie by omission, they are waiting for Emmanuel Macron to be elected to do so. Everything is from the facade.
23163	39	You may have seen Emmanuel Macron promise heaps of gifts such as a “food check”, but Emmanuel Macron asks you to elect him to give you a gift with your own money. Whereas, on the contrary, Marine Le Pen proposes a reduction in VAT on certain consumer products and therefore savings at source.
23163	41	Again, no one knows what will happen to these promises, but we see who has a smoky speech.
23163	43	[…]
23163	45	If you voted for Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round, and you personally opposed Emmanel Macron, you may have been surprised that Jean-Luc Mélenchon was so quick to say that you shouldn't vote for the candidate who is against Macron in the second round. However, JEan-Luc Mélenchon's program had many points in common with that of Marine Le Pen, such as the Citizens' Initiative Referendum or the withdrawal of the vaccination pass. If he disagreed on certain points, Jean-Luc Mélenchon had immense leverage to wrest concessions from Marine Le Pen, and he did not seize it.
23163	47	"In the second round of 2017, the government agreement established between Marine Le Pen and Nicolas Dupont-Aignan contained ""a lot of renunciations on the part of the National Front"", and here I am quoting my words from 2017 again, so I wrote that Nicolas Dupont -Aignan had obtained “some of these renunciations which directly affect the inhumanity which is often reproached to the Front National, such as the renunciation of charging for the schooling of foreign children. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan having obtained from the Front-National to put the good of the child above all”. Similarly, the Front National had, I quote myself again, “committed to taking over the disability assistance measures of the Debout La France program”. See how these concessions were genuinely accepted, and how consideration for people with disabilities became an essential part of Marine Le Pen's program five years later. Jean-Luc Mélenchon could have negotiated in the same way, but instead, he immediately called not to vote the candidate who could fire Emmanuel Macron to then reveal his true intention: to become the prime minister."
23163	49	"On the groups of yellow vests and conveyors, people say they are ""annihilated, devastated, flabbergasted"" by the 28% of Macron, but they also designate Mélenchon as ""a rot and a traitor"". Many voted Mélenchon... and the one who flirted with the yellow vests and the anti-passes turns out to be a submissive to the trimmer, and it does not pass."
23163	51	So to see him now aspire to be Macron's prime minister... All that for that, was that the deal in fact?
23163	53	It is true that even on his first round plaque Jean-Luc Mélenchon did not see himself in the second round. You can check.
23163	55	[…] I believe that the only one who can go beyond that in cynicism is Emmanuel Macron, who was not afraid to announce his desire to delay the retirement age to 65 because we know very well that all those who are who died before the age of 65 cannot vote against Emmanuel Macron. This is the exact definition, in the literal sense of the word, of survivorship bias.
23163	57	[…]
23163	59	"I wrote in 2017 that ""Emmanuel Macron is the candidate [of] 49.3 and the candidate of the government by ordinance"". I had written that “Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of this political caste which ignores hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and throws out petitions of hundreds of thousands of signatures”. I wrote this in 2017 before his election, and Emmanuel Macron's five-year term has been the five-year term of a great fictional debate and forgotten notebooks of grievances, a five-year term of uninterrupted demonstrations, repressed by mutilations."
23163	61	"I had written that ""Emmanuel Macron benefits from the moral guarantee of the left, this same morality which closes its eyes to the massacres in the name of socialism, blinded by the fascination for dictators"", and we indeed see certain figures on the left express their anguish that some people do not vote Macron."
23163	63	I had written that “Just as Nazism substituted German culture with a surrogate culture ([the] Nazi myth), the Macron system denies French culture”. It replaces it with its own European myth.
23163	65	"I had written ""that Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of the party which defends GPA, PMA, and other commodification and exploitation of the body of others, taking care of women only to better exploit them"". I wrote in 2017 that “Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of the party of euthanasia and eugenics, which eliminates the weak when they cost the financial system too much, and which eliminates the disabled and other unwelcome people before birth. to purify the race."
23163	67	And what did Emmanuel Macron bring during his five-year term? The extension of the abortion period, the elimination of hospital beds in the midst of a pandemic, and the easier administration of Rivotril to the elderly. So I do not see what interest Emmanuel Macron can have today in children, disabled people, parents, and the elderly. If Macron speaks of the healthy as people who are nothing, what is his opinion of the elderly, young children, the disabled and the sick?
23163	69	I wrote in 2017 that “Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of financial speculation which is enriched [by] the displacement of populations, populations that are parked in camps. […] Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of the party that fuels wars in foreign countries and then opens the borders to welcome these prefabricated refugees. Emmanuel Macron is the candidate of the MED EF […] who is delighted with these waves of workers who are vulnerable because they have been destroyed”. He was unable to prevent the war in Ukraine and you know how, through his involvement in the Alstom scandal, he was the architect of our loss of sovereignty which rendered France incapable of being a credible interlocutor to prevent the war in Ukraine. And now he's talking about civil war.
23163	71	During these elections in 2022, I did not see any candidate promise to reverse the El Khomri law, I did not see any candidate promise to reverse the Macron orders. But of all the candidates who ran in these elections, Emmanuel Macron is the one who facilitated dismissals, who reduced severance pay, and who reduced the statute of limitations to one year for industrial tribunals.
23163	73	"And then there is all this scandal around consulting firms, Mc Kinsey in mind. When Joann Chapoutot talks about the Nazi origins of modern management, he addresses the question of the fabrication of consent, and also how the state is substituted by agencies, which is exactly the description of Macron's politics based on McKinsey. That is to say that on the organizational level, Macron's ""governance"" is much closer to the Nazi managerial method than to the 5th Republic."
23163	75	Listen to Joann Chapoutot:
23163	77	And what is very interesting is that Reinhard Höhn is one of those people who, basically, think with forty years in advance, what in the 1970s we will call New Public Management, that is to say the replacement of the State by ad hoc agencies, agencies which have: a project, a budget, a mission, and which are there only for this mission. While the state poses a problem, […] you see, it is a structure that is sustainable, that remains and that costs money. Well agencies, that's perfect: it's an institution that only lasts as long as its mission must be accomplished, once it's over, it's over. So in fact, it doesn't happen like that, because the agencies have a form of durability, a form of persistence in being which makes them subsist on their own […] it's more of a plan four years, it's a nine-year plan after all. But in any case the idea is there that the state must be pulverized. And that's what the Nazis did in 1933, they destroyed the state. They do it and they say it more. Until Hitler, Hitler in his speeches said that the state must disappear.
23163	79	"Macron is the one who said at the Sorbonne in 2017: ""You have no choice, you have only one simple choice, to want this Europe by taking all the risks"". Macron is the one who in a millennial impulse in Athens in 2017 called for a stronger Europe, asking to have, in his words, ""extreme ambition"". These words were the basis of La République En Marche's campaign clip for the European elections in 2019."
23163	81	[…] Macron is this man who speaks to us about Europe with the same fervor as if he speaks to us about a Reich which must last 1000 years.
23163	83	So I will end with these words of Sophie Scholl, guillotined for having distributed leaflets against Nazism:
23163	85	What does my death matter if, thanks to us, thousands of men have their eyes opened.
23163	87	On Sunday, the only risk you have to take is to go to a polling station. Vote for the one you want elected, or vote against the one you see as the greatest Nazi risk. Afterwards, the risk will be greater, Macron has already threatened you with civil war.
23164	1	Faced with the lawless liar, Marine fought well
23164	3	So it's time for the big return match, a remake of 2017 wanted by the two finalists. First by Macron, convinced that he will once again emerge victorious from the confrontation, then by Marine, who intends to take revenge on the fiasco of the previous duel. Everyone has prepared for it, Marine having learned from her past mistakes, and Macron having to fight back at all costs against a most calamitous record and erase his image as president of the rich, so arrogant and contemptuous towards the people and so critical of France, which has done so much harm over the centuries.
23164	5	Everything about Macron rings false and exudes insincerity.
23164	7	"But unlike all the debates of the Fifth Republic opposing two candidates for the supreme magistracy, we will not only be entitled to an exchange between two projects that everything opposes, but this decisive exchange will also be the ""Everything but Macron"" against the "" Anything but Navy."
23164	9	Rejection against rejection, such will be the verdict of the ballot boxes on April 10.
23164	11	Because if Macron remains the most hated president of the Fifth Republic, the Globalist System hastened to demonize Marine excessively, making her the Hitler in petticoats guilty of all evils. Moreover, Marine being in no way responsible for the sinking of France, greatly aggravated by Macron, it is hypocritical to accuse her of incompetence. Hence the return of the Republican front and the dam on the far right, the eternal hobbyhorse of the nation's gravediggers.
23164	13	The press addicted to subsidies no longer speaks of the Le Pen vote but of the Le Pen risk!
23164	15	Since it is no longer support for a project that guides the voter, but rather the hatred of the opponent, it is necessary to be very careful about the polls, which give Macron the winner at 55/45. Not only can there be more abstention than in the first round, but the anger in the voting booth can generate big surprises.
23164	17	Hence the importance of this debate, which can make a difference.
23164	19	What I hope is that Marine does not allow herself to be locked into a technical debate in which she will never have the advantage against a seasoned Macron.
23164	21	What is needed is for it to resume a listing of all the turpitudes, all the insults, all the presidential shenanigans since 2017.
23164	23	If she makes the mistake of defending her program instead of attacking Macron for his misdeeds and his Machiavellian machinations, she will lose.
23164	25	She must recite a string of truths, which describe the real Macron and destabilize him.
23164	27	“Once elected, I will not wallow in the mire in Saint-Martin, once elected, I will not sing nonsense on the steps of the Elysée, once elected, I will not accuse France of crimes against humanity, once elected, I will not smear my country on the UN platform, once elected, I will not call the French people lazy, illiterate, alcoholics or less than nothing, once elected , I will not sell our industrial jewels to foreigners, once elected, I will not despise French culture and art, once elected, I will not let insecurity explode by 35%, once elected, I will not let fundamentalist Islam to lay down the law in the cities…”
23164	29	"Remember the famous anaphora of Holland, ""Me president"" ... which left Sarkozy KO on the spot in 2012."
23164	31	Debate
23164	33	Finally, this debate, which lasted 2h50, was too long, with too many subjects skimmed over.
23164	35	It was quite boring, no highlight, no candidate really took the upper hand over his opponent.
23164	37	Very technical debate on the Macron side, who showed his permanent self-satisfaction.
23164	39	More human and more sincere debate on the Marine side, which has never stalled.
23164	41	I found that Macron was bored and saw the moment as a superfluous ordeal, a chore he would have gladly done without, assured of his victory no matter what.
23164	43	Marine was more motivated, more sincere and closer to the people.
23164	45	She had obviously worked on her files and did not crash like in 2017.
23164	47	This will not be the general opinion in the media bewitched by Macron, but I give a slight advantage to Marine, who stood up to her opponent when he denied the obvious or lied.
23164	49	Macron's professorial tone is unbearable to me, Marine's sincerity pleased me.
23164	51	Macron blamed his failures on the pandemic, defending a positive record across the board.
23164	53	Marine gave credible figures that Macron denied, of course.
23164	55	In short, we will see if this debate changes the final result. It can improve the score of Marine, hitherto given at 45%
23164	57	All evening, Macron promised us that he would do what he did not do. A stronger and more efficient State, when Marine wants more justice, fraternity, protection and harmony.
23164	59	On purchasing power, everyone has their own measures
23164	61	For Marine, 7 out of 10 French people believe they have lost purchasing power and unemployment has never dropped if we take all categories into account.
23164	63	Macron claims instead to have created 1.2 million jobs
23164	65	They are opposed to temporary energy checks and the reduction of permanent VAT.
23164	67	On Ukraine, they agree on the essentials in order to help Ukraine, Marine nevertheless opposing the blocking of gas and oil, which would do unheard of harm to the French people and businesses. She is obviously right. Let's not do hara-kiri. Marine wants to reconnect with Russia at the end of the conflict, fearing the emergence of a Russia/China bloc.
23164	69	Macron attacks him violently on the loan contracted with a Russian bank. A low blow, because no French bank wanted to grant him a loan in 2017. In addition, Macron had promised a bank of democracy which never saw the light of day, like everything this liar promises.
23164	71	Accusing Marine of being linked to her banker Poutine, Macron is aggressive. Marine retorts that she remains a free woman and that she cannot be blamed for borrowing from abroad what France refuses her. On this point, she is right. This relentlessness of Macron, who received Poutine at Versailles and at Brégançon, is grotesque. A vicious blow.
23164	73	On Europe, the disagreement is total. On foreign workers, on trade agreements, on European sovereignty. Marine wants a Europe of nations and hopes that France will finally defend its interests, to protect our farmers and our businesses.
23164	75	We are a big country and not just a piece of Europe
23164	77	On pensions, there is still disagreement. 65 years for Macron, at the rate of 4 additional months per year. 60 to 62 years for Marine with 40 annuities.
23164	79	Attacked on the 600 billion additional debts in five years, Macron assumes and says to have saved companies and jobs.
23164	81	Marine recalls the 400,000 additional poor, the 85 billion trade deficit, productivity at half mast at + 0.1%, industrial jobs lost. She wants to relocate. Marine is rather combative.
23164	83	Hospital and Ehpad
23164	85	Macron insists on the means, Marine recalls the suffering of the profession, exhausted. They agree on more means and controls.
23164	87	Ecology
23164	89	It is free trade that produces 50% of the greenhouse gas. Producing 10,000 km from the place of consumption is pure madness. We must relocate production, develop economic patriotism, fight unfair competition and animal suffering in livestock chains.
23164	91	A long exchange opposes them on nuclear and wind power, to which Marine is totally opposed.
23164	93	She accuses Macron of closing Fessenheim and penalizing EDF with EU energy rules. We lost 10 years on the renewal of the nuclear fleet.
23164	95	Called a climato-skeptic, Marine retorts: “you are a climato-hypocrite”
23164	97	Digital Economy
23164	99	Both agree on the need for a European Google, like Ariane or Airbus.
23164	101	School
23164	103	Marine rightly insists on the collapse of the school. Macron defends his record
23164	105	Learning that has more than doubled, compulsory math until the baccalaureate. Classes of 12 students in priority areas.
23164	107	For Marine, in addition to the fundamentals, it is imperative to restore school safety and discipline.
23164	109	Security
23164	111	We would have liked Marine to give the figures for the explosion of violence. The people can no longer take this permanent barbarism and savagery.
23164	113	Thefts and violence are everywhere. All property is stolen, livestock, crops, construction machinery, tractors. It is mass immigration that is generating this explosion of insecurity.
23164	115	We must morally rearm the police despised by the authorities, we must rethink justice that is too lax. Marine wants 25,000 prison places
23164	117	Macron still defends his record. 10,000 more police. 200 gendarmerie brigades created. And 1500 cyber-patrollers planned.
23164	119	Secularism
23164	121	Complete disagreement. For Macron, secularism is freedom. He is for the veil.
23164	123	Debate on the veil that Marine wants to ban in public space to liberate Muslim women. The 4,500 foreigners registered in the file of radicalized people must be expelled.
23164	125	570 radical mosques are to be closed. The fundamentalist movements which refused to sign the Charter on secularism have never been worried and continue to cause harm.
23164	127	For Macron, Navy will bring civil war.
23164	129	An accusation that makes Marine jump. The law, everyone must respect it.
23164	131	Immigration
23164	133	Marine wants a referendum on jus soli, the expulsion of criminals, national priority for employment and housing, asylum requested in consulates abroad, a ban on the regularization of illegal immigrants.
23164	135	On all these subjects Macron wants a European solution, so it is eternal immobility.
23164	137	On the institutions, which Macron has never reformed, in particular the proportional system, Marine will use article 11 to let the people decide by referendum. It is legal and democratic.
23164	139	Conclusion
23164	141	Macron sees in this election a referendum for or against the EU, ecology, fraternity!
23164	143	Marine wants to put an end to globalist brutality, crime, the wreckage of identity and the destruction of our social model.
23164	145	This debate ends after 2:50.
23164	147	He may not change the outcome of the vote, but honestly, faced with a liar and a hypocrite like Macron, who has been destroying the country for five years, the sincerity of Marine deserves to be underlined.
23164	149	I will vote for her, because Macron is a real destroyer of our social model and our cultural heritage.

For some, impressed by his power of seduction and his reformist rhetoric, he would be the natural son of Kennedy and Mendès France. One can doubt it, the first had more charisma, the second more principles. For others, he would be Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. [...] No, the Roman who most resembles Macron is not Brutus, it is Macron. Naevius Sutorius Macro, known as Macron, high official (yes, yes) who became, thanks to a palace revolution, the adviser to Tiberius, emperor detached from current affairs, he will end up assassinating him...

But can we say that he was a great president, in the sense that he would have succeeded in the great labors of Hercules? Nah, he didn't do anything at all. In fact, after a year, he had the Yellow Vests. After two years, he managed to put people on the streets and achieve one of the longest social movements in this country. And finally, on the management of the health, economic and social crisis, it is in permanent improvisation. »
23165	65	Reading my many chronicles, some sad people might think that I am exaggerating or that I am in bad faith on Macron. Well, this time it wasn't me who said it.

23165	69	"Macron the ""gifted"" in economics, remained only an investment banker at the service of his wealthy sponsors"

23166	1	Why France Might Not Survive US Agent Macron's New Five-Year Term
23166	3	"In violation of the most basic republican and democratic principles, but not hesitating to present itself ""at the same time"" as the bulwark of the Republic and of democracy, most of the media barked during the fortnight between -two rounds against Marine Le Pen and were careful not to mess with his opponent. To this little game of demolition and protection, who can be surprised that Marine Le Pen, given practically on a par with Macron on the evening of the first round (49% against 51% according to Ifop), has unscrewed by almost eight points in the interval? Had the media done the opposite, spared Marine Le Pen and burdened Macron with the countless explosive cases he lugs around, the outcome of the election would most likely have been reversed. That is to say that Marine Le Pen would have won. One conclusion is obvious: for the first time in France, and without a doubt given the small gap at the start and finish, it was the media that made the election. And the media being only one of the propagandist arms of the System, we can affirm that the System made the election. As usual, some will answer, not without reason…"
23166	5	At this stage, we can do nothing more for the others, those who have not understood, while the presidential campaign has been biased from A to Z by the press under orders, that everything has been done to ensure the re-election of Macron , in the absence of Pécresse who so disappointed.
23166	7	Let it be said: since on Sunday April 24, Macron was re-elected, France will continue to be the puppet of the United States. Governed by a servant of the Plutocrats, our country will continue, over the next five years, its self-destruction already well underway. With this nuance: this time, France may not survive it...
23166	9	During the great debate between the two rounds, Emmanuel Macron accused Marine Le Pen of being subject to Russia. The former president of the National Rally (RN) should have replied that he was reversing the roles a little, since the President of the Republic is totally subject to the United States. He is even its agent.
23166	11	Agent Macron delivers his own country, France, to the United States, as the extremely serious Alstom affair, among many other scandalous cases, has amply demonstrated.
23166	13	Orwellien Young Leader of the French-American Foundation
23166	15	The French-American Foundation (FAF): most French people are unaware of the existence of this powerful organization. Quite simply because the press is careful not to make a big deal out of it.
23166	17	It never occurred to any magazine to make its cover on the FAF, nor to any daily newspaper to make its front page. However, created in 1976 under the good auspices of the very Americanophile Giscard d'Estaing and his counterpart Gerald Ford, this organization notoriously linked to the CIA enjoys an exorbitant influence in France. Among its members, let us cite a few revealing names: Emmanuel Macron, Edouard Philippe, François Hollande, Valérie Pécresse. As we can see, the last two Presidents of the Republic are Young Leaders of the FAF which will total, if all goes as planned, fifteen years in power in France. Fifteen years of absolute disaster, of which the next five could logically be the worst, even fatal.
23166	19	One thing is certain: France will experience a descent into hell.
23166	21	As we have explained for almost two years (1), already ruined in unprecedented proportions during Macron's first five-year term, the State will bend under the crushing weight of its debt. Over the past five years, although the exact amount is obviously very difficult to obtain from Bercy's services, it would seem that the debt has increased in total, and at a minimum, by 1000 billion euros: 600 billion under the pretext of Covid (according to Macron himself, during the debate between the two rounds), to which we add another 400 billion in current deficit. That is, in just five years, nearly half the amount, already gigantic, accumulated in half a century by its six predecessors!
23166	23	"This bankruptcy of the State will make it possible to ""justify"", with falsely sorry airs, the liquidation of the social model and the sale at auction of what remains of the national heritage. A huge cake to be shared between financial giants (I almost wrote phynance), the dear friends of Ubu Macron, on the backs of the good people and the Country who understand nothing about it."
23166	25	Over the next five years, the population, subject to confinements, curfews, compulsory injections and the recurrent or permanent vaccination pass, and perhaps even ration tickets under the pretext of shortage caused by the real-false war perpetual with Russia, the population will experience an Orwellian destiny.
23166	27	At Orwell, in 1984, we tend to forget it, the real-false war is in the background and allows to crush consciences a little more...
23166	29	The Missing Millions of US Agent Macron
23166	31	At this point, a question arises.
23166	33	Is Macron acting voluntarily, out of simple greed for this power that is delivered to him with great blows of lies and permanent manipulation, particularly in the media?
23166	35	Or, another hypothesis, is Macron corrupt? Does he have, at the moment, colossal secret accounts, into which hundreds of millions, billions of dollars are pouring?
23166	37	Macron's declared assets (approximately 500,000 euros in 2022, a figure which made the whole of Paris laugh a lot but did not in any way prevent him from presenting himself again) makes it possible to consider more seriously the existence of hidden accounts, on which the millions earned as a partner at Rothschild would have disappeared. According to Jean-Baptiste Rivoire, co-author of Macron's Heritage survey, where have the millions gone?, everything seems to indicate that part of the sums earned in the bank, the amount of which itself would be clearly undervalued or under-declared or withheld from declaration, would have flown off to an unknown destination. If they exist, would these same hidden accounts be fed today by BlackRock, Pfizer, Moderna and many other financial and industrial colossi in exchange for high treason as Macronian as Cyclopean?
23166	39	Because the numbers here are staggering. The amounts we are talking about amount to hundreds of billions of euros, and in the medium term to trillions of euros. The enormous yield of the butchering and siphoning of France, its state and its people.
23166	41	Question: Would Macron be the biggest crook of all time, whose gogo would be the French people, and ultimately France itself?
23166	43	"Another question: would Macron dream, after the operation of looting and destruction of France that he undertook five years ago in the wake of his deleterious role as Minister of the Economy of François Hollande, of push the annihilation to its conclusion since, after all, the French are stupid enough to have led him back into business? Would Macron intend to completely crush his own country and his own people in order, then, rich with tens or even hundreds of billions of euros, his modest share of the enormous cake, to continue his dark career among the brains of the Davos conspiracy? ? Which, around the disturbing Klaus Schwab, will try to carry out its Luciferian plan: to reduce the West to slavery, between confinement at the slightest pretext (remember that the Omicron variant, however benign, was enough to ""justify"" the shift towards the very liberticide allegedly passes vaccination in January 2022…), compulsory regular injections and strange QRCodes. Humans marked as bewildered cattle or tin cans, and having to show white paw to buy, have a drink or sell one, and likely to be ""disconnected"" at any time. The Mark of the Beast? It seems, it is true, to please Macron so much that he sows the figure behind him like Tom Thumb. Against the background of Notre-Dame in flames, an object so aesthetic, so beautiful that it adorned, in a golden frame, a spiritual color among all, his office in his 2022 campaign launch video. Vade retro…"
23166	45	Far from the mystical delusions that may or may not make you smile, we can never say it enough: hundreds, thousands of billions of euros (or dollars, etc.) are at stake in the capital swindle whose presidential election has was the highlight. Marine Le Pen was denigrated to the point of caricature from her accession to the second round, the role of the black sheep having been held in the first round by Eric Zemmour. This eliminated, overnight, the media began to hunt Marine Le Pen in packs, while systematically sparing Macron all explosive files, from Alstom to McKinsey. We remember the phenomenal uproar around the various Fillon cases in 2017, yet infinitely less serious...
23166	47	The presidential scam is basically consistent with the Covid-19 operation scam, which itself is only one aspect of an even larger scam, in which the funny war with Russia.
23166	49	In this jumble of nested scams, one should particularly attract our attention: the one that has been going on for ten years, and whose strings the United States is pulling to line its pockets.
23166	51	Namely the supreme imposture which consists in placing American agents at the head of the French state, to lead the looting or even the demolition of the country.
23166	53	Washington, vampire of his friends
23166	55	A looting / demolition operation in which Washington participates, where the deep state is so powerful that it can be satisfied with a wax statue as president: the cacochyme Biden.
23166	57	This completely decadent country secretes a delirious mixture of financial groups managing gigantic funds (BlackRock alone weighs at least 6000 billion dollars...), of a so-called instrumentalized Justice, of the arms industry brewing extravagant credits, of dollars that have been printed in abundance from the printing press for decades, finally, last but not least, from the sprawling secret services. It looks like an obese USSR at the end of its life...
23166	59	The American monster has thrived throughout its brief history only on plunder, slaughter and war. However, having failed in all the conflicts and attempts at destabilization that he has fomented for twenty years around the world, this sick man of America sees himself inexorably supplanted by China and the enormous bloc that it forms with Russia and other countries. other countries that refuse its deadly yoke. In this great game, for lack of anything better, all that remains for Uncle Sam is to vampirize his allies.
23166	61	The means are multiple. We can take legal action and condemn European companies to pay colossal fines (BNP Paribas case, nearly 9 billion dollars in fines) without the French State moving an ear. We can set up real conspiracies and pacts of corruption in order to absorb an industrial jewel (Alstom), strategic in the civil as well as the military, and find in the operation complicities at the highest level of the French State (Hollande, Macron) and civil society. We can reward these very serious high betrayals by activating all our networks to have the agent (Macron) thus introduced elected as head of state. Leaders can be spied on with impunity, without them being offended, trust does not exclude control. We can directly remotely guide a leading political leader (Macron) via consulting firms (McKinsey), to trigger a Covid-19 operation coordinated internationally by the same kind of pharmacies. Although the virus displays a proven mortality which does not exceed 0.1% in the general population, the strategy and the propaganda of fear, relayed by the WHO whose first contributor is Bill Gates (the man who wants to inject everything goes to the planet), allow the suspension of a large part of public freedoms, the quasi-compulsory injection of the population, the establishment of a vaccination pass, for the greater profit of American firms, a once again.
23166	63	More serious perhaps, this operation ruined the State and Social Security in unprecedented proportions, ravaged the economy and society, traumatized childhood and locked up youth. And ultimately, enormously enriched the richest, the American and international Plutocrats, great friends of Macron, who have an open table at the Elysée.
23166	65	The ignored yet giant Covid-19 criminal scam
23166	67	During the great debate between the two rounds, Macron repeated with impunity that the Covid-19 was the biggest epidemic for a century. Huge live lie neither noticed nor denounced by anyone! To assert, as Macron did, that Covid-19 is the greatest epidemic for a century is obviously false, since, let us repeat, the mortality rate of Covid-19 does not exceed that of a major flu. Even more revealing, the almost harmless nature of Covid-19 for people under sixty-five without comorbidities ultimately makes it less dangerous than many flus, especially for young adults, adolescents and children in good health, since those these are, so to speak, invulnerable to him.
23166	69	Thus, live on Wednesday April 20, 2022, Macron was able to take advantage of the biggest lie of our time, which has served to rot our lives and ruin the Country for two years... without being contradicted!
23166	71	The whole Covid-19 scam consisted in using a kind of carbine flu as a pretext to undermine France in depth, and to enslave its people with extraordinary efficiency. The operation was made possible by a series of political and media manipulations. But also by what is undoubtedly one of the most atrocious aspects of this case: the ban on treatment. The deaths thus caused have fueled the narrative of fear. Under this aspect, since the mass murder was put at the service of a political purpose, we are indeed in front of a crime against humanity. But to say that is to be classed among the conspirators, and therefore to be inaudible because literally demonized. A rhetoric that makes it possible to neutralize this argument, however terrible, that was the ban on treatments, from Hydroxychloroquine to Ivermectin via Azithromycin, with its thousands of induced deaths...
23166	73	All this with one primary objective: predation.
23166	75	France is devoured with the help of the maker Macron, helped by the networks linked to the CIA which crisscross the political, media and economic circles. There are even a few soldiers among these networks, the most emblematic of which is undoubtedly that of the Young Leaders of the French-American Foundation mentioned above.
23166	77	At the beginning of the Fifth Republic, De Gaulle, by abandoning the African overseas territories and Algeria, by destroying the Empire, definitively wiped France off the map as a leading world power. A rank it had held for many centuries.
23166	79	At the twilight of the Fifth Republic, it is France tout court, or what remains of it, that Macron could well liquidate once and for all. Thus, with Macron, the oldest nation in Europe would disappear, victim of a cogwheel in the form of a machination.
23166	81	But behind Macron as behind De Gaulle, we find the United States. From brothers John Foster and Allen Dulles to the French-American Foundation.
23166	83	The United States dynamited Greater France with De Gaulle. These same United States complete France with Macron. We are living this last phase, that of the thrust.
23166	85	Today in the clutches of those who destroy us, who vampirize us, who devour us, of whom Macron is the servant, the puppet animated by McKinsey for whom he pays the price of gold as in a Faustian tale, we have just signed for five more years.
23166	87	If Macron obtains the majority in the Assembly, and there is every reason to fear that he will have it, we will be finished.
23167	1	Dupond-Moretti votes for Mélenchon: same hatred of the cops
23167	3	This self-proclaimed specialist in the fight against the RN and the far right has the costume of an activist for the defense of thugs who are, according to him, the collateral victims of the shift to the right of society. He unceremoniously prophesies anti-fascist propaganda and the phantom menace of the far-right vote.
23167	5	Dupond-Moretti hits hard at the end of July 2022. France and the French see with anguish the progression of nonsense among the ministers of Macronie. Radio-television is the only element that really matters for Dupond-Moretti, who is fighting against the RN and the far right but not on the ground.
23167	7	Dupond-Moretti among the Nupes: Injustice. Anger. Frustration. Words are weak when you can no longer trust the word of a minister. High treason finally recognized! And suddenly, quietly, Dupond-Moretti admits having voted NUPES. (Gabrielle Cluzel, bvoltaire.fr) Scandal? Eric Dupond-Moretti's little sentence made absolutely no noise in the media. Yet this revelation deserves more attention!
23167	9	"Shamelessly, Dupond-Moretti admits to having voted NUPES, the party of those who shout that ""the police kill"", who march alongside Assa Traoré, and the one who boasts of having sold drugs!"
23167	11	Dupond-Moretti hits hard: “There are a number of NUPES deputies who are Republicans. I am thinking of those who belong to a government party. In my constituency, I voted for someone from NUPES who belonged to the democratic left. But, for the National Right, everything is to be thrown away.
23167	13	For the far left, Dupond-Moretti delicately practices republican respect. There is a moral because the NUPES candidate in question, who was to be an EELV candidate, Émilie Ducourant, was beaten against the RN candidate Pierrick Berteloot. She did not answer if she was in solidarity with Sandrine Rousseau and if [she thought] also that the police kill. Here, then, is the democratic left as Éric Dupond-Moretti conceives it.
23167	15	And at the same time, 73% of French people are unhappy with the justice system, highlighting its laxity!
23167	17	For the support of a minister of Macron on the far left, Dupond-Moretti is a strong symbol.
23167	19	For Dupond-Moretti, the priority of penal policy is given to the ideology of the extreme left. Dupond-Moretti is unlikely to contaminate French common sense. Despite this, he did not raise the very poor level of Macron's ministers: It is unworthy of all our republican principles.
23167	21	The French victims of the thugs are pariahs whom Dupond-Moretti stubbornly humiliates even while undocumented criminals and violent illegal immigrants are always left to go unpunished.
23167	23	Can we account for the absurd government logic of Dupond-Moretti? We are waiting for a rational explanation for the fact that Dupond-Moretti shamelessly admits having voted NUPES! This is global glory. His wealth is worldwide. It was among undocumented migrant foreigners that he found his best allies in his fight against the RN and the National Right, such as the right to a Palestinian state against Israel, a so-called colonial state. All of Macron's pro-Algerian remarks were accepted without criticism.
23167	25	And if he has not become a cult phraseologist in Algeria, at least he has not discredited the FLN in power. Macron hoped to do theatre. Candidate-President, he wanted to make us his cinema in Algeria!
23167	27	It is that Macron is not just anyone in Algeria, like Dupond-Moretti in prison. This is why Dupond-Moretti prefers to vote for the neo-Marxist Islamo-leftist deputies of the NUPES without adhering to the libertarian catechism of vulgar Macronie. Because Dupond-Moretti did not know the misery of the victims of violence in the lost neighborhoods of the Republic. Revolutionary violence is at the heart of the neo-Marxist ideology of NUPES. Dupond-Moretti, this man who thinks like Mélanchon, arouses doubt in vulgar Macronie. It offers the possibility of a disproportionate revolt in the prisons.
23167	29	"And this shattered presidential destiny of Mélenchon makes him more than a great politician. For Dupond-Moretti, there is like a hero in him! And he likes what makes him like the figure of the thug with ""the police kill""!"
23167	31	The talkative mythology of Dupond-Moretti is done in detail, raised by a mother who earned her living by cleaning. For him, it is fashionable on the left to regard the RN vote with contempt. He is far from head and shoulders above left-wing intellectuals! The reference anti-fascist guru is Mélenchon who, from the height of his Islamo-leftist arrogance, displays his level of philosophical incompetence.
23167	33	Dupond-Moretti among the Nupes: no one stigmatizes his partiality! We would completely forget him and his reputation would always be at its lowest, totally despised by the world of justice, if he did not support the Nupes! He is an isolated man, lost among the Nupes. Great minds do not hate Dupond-Moretti, they ignore him. Today we measure the path taken by Macron by renewing Dupond-Moretti!
23167	35	The French observe that the collapse of justice in France results from the ideological certainties of Dupond-Moretti which make Macron more and more persona non grata among the majority of French people. This is why its immigration policy is subject to the cosmopolitan ethico-political values ​​of the EU and the mystification of human rights. With Macron and Dupond-Moretti, we are in the midst of ideology.
23167	37	Macron and Dupond-Moretti want to impose the transition to a real outrageous sectarian libertarian liberal left with the total dehumanization of the globalist immigration policy of the EU.
23167	39	Justice without freedom is dictatorship and freedom without justice is the law of the strongest!
23167	41	With Éric Zemmour: We must regain control of our country!
23168	1	In Cameroon, Macron expressed concern about the Russian presence in Africa
23168	3	On tour in Africa, Emmanuel Macron was worried about Russian influence on the African continent. The French president is trying to rekindle a flame that has gradually died out in recent years.
23168	5	Emmanuel Macron arrived in Cameroon to begin his African tour. He wants to revive relations between Africa and France which are losing ground. In Yaoundé, he met President Paul Biya. But during the press conference that followed this interview, Mr. Macron considered the Russian presence in Africa “worrying”.
23168	7	"If he mentioned first of all the presence of ""a great political and military power"" which has developed relations with several countries, which is normal in the great concert of nations, he then showed himself to be more aggressive in calling this Russian presence “a hybrid”."
23168	9	To explain this hybrid presence, he did not hesitate to point the finger at the Russian media RT and Sputnik, banned in the European Union following a decision by the European Commission. After Cameroon, Emmanuel Macron will stop in Benin and Guinea-Bissau.
23168	11	A tense visit
23168	13	"The Cameroonian bi-weekly Sans Détour in its July 25 edition described Emmanuel Macron's visit as a ""minefield"". For the media, this stay hides issues that boil down to preserving a section of the pre-square against rival influences. The question of the succession of Paul Biya, aged 89, could also be on the table according to the newspaper. Then, he will seek to settle the different histories with Yaoundé linked to colonization which had been deadly, specifies Sans Détour."
23168	15	This position is also shared by La Voix du Centre, a weekly newspaper which headlined the visit: “For what purposes? “. The newspaper claims that the French President has never been kind to his Cameroonian counterpart although the two countries have long cooperative relations.
23168	17	A fading French influence
23168	19	France's position in recent years has weakened in Africa. The Barkhane operation carried out in the Sahel and the Sahara since 2014 by France resulted in the withdrawal of the French army from the region. This French presence was criticized in the region.
23168	21	A 2021 Mali-Mètre poll that asked Malians to voice their grievances against Barkhane found that 73% of respondents blamed French military forces for failing to protect people from violence. The second complaint was that they were complicit with the armed forces (45%) and the third complaint was that the force was not able to protect itself.
23169	3	"The electoral promises of E. Macron often turn out to be analyzed, after they have been executed, in an announcement of a ""bad move"" (against an achievement, a freedom, a prerogative of the State) wrapped in gift wrap."
23169	5	It is obviously the same with the promise to abolish the TV license that the National Assembly has just voted.
23169	7	We want to reduce the deficit and we remove a fee … still without increasing taxes!
23169	9	A 10-year-old child would find this “weird”.
23169	11	He was then explained that this is the preparatory phase for privatization. According to the known process: the State gradually withdraws from funding, and the institution must itself find the funds it needs to operate. Exactly as one does with the university or with the public hospital. (Which are “market” services in the “European” societal ideology). And afterwards, we transform the status of the organism
23169	13	so that it falls into the hands of private investors (PTT, Edf, airports, etc.).
23169	15	Public news channels, run by people in tune with the rulers, tell what the government needs, in particular to keep the population in a kind of sluggish state, and away from roundabouts.
23169	17	We are, in a certain way, in the situation of 1958 in which public broadcasting was controlled by the executive power.
23169	19	But there is a size difference.
23169	21	It is that in 1958 the written press was hostile to the person and to the conceptions of General de Gaulle: Hence the idea of ​​controlling public television and radio so that the voice of the government - at the time: interest general, dignity of France in the world – can be heard.
23169	23	And it is that today, the private media militate alongside the Head of State in favor of a societal ideology in which the free life of business is, within, considered as taking the place of general interest. And in which submission to the USA is seen outside as the way to universal salvation.
23169	25	We also know that European texts make heads of state and government of ancient nations a kind of business introducer, allowing private investors to acquire what was until then owned, controlled or regulated by the state. . That is to say, what belonged to the people in an earlier version of the notion of democracy. In this respect, we have seen that E. Macron was (Alstom, Le Monde, Mc Kinsey, …) a virtuoso in this field.
23169	27	Privatizing the public media would therefore not currently change anything in the facts.
23169	29	But, if we think of the future, if we envisage that one day the Head of State will be one again, if we imagine that parliamentarians will represent a people who will have recovered the right to decide what is good for him, it is necessary that the institutions of the State have the means to be heard.
23169	31	It would have seemed prudent to us for the State to retain, in this perspective, control over part of the audio-visual media. The bosses of the chains and the radios then doing that day … only continue to be at the orders. But for another (and better) cause.
2317	1	Russia helps Donbass, France militarizes Ukraine
2317	3	France will increase its overall aid to Ukraine to 2 billion dollars against 1.7 billion so far, i.e. an additional 300 million dollars, Emmanuel Macron announced last Thursday, May 5 in a video broadcast during the conference. international donors. 2 billion drawn from the pocket of French taxpayers WITHOUT THEIR AGREEMENT! 2 billion poured out with generosity while the APL of students is lowered, that pensions are not revalued and that there is serious question of lowering the allowances of the unemployed… for lack of money! The state coffers are empty for the French but full for the Ukrainians, look for the error.
2317	5	Financial aid that is based on state lies, repeated all the time on TV, radio and in the written press to better make the French sheep swallow the snake.
2317	7	So far we have provided Ukraine with 615 tonnes of equipment brought in with the support of the European Union, including medicines, medical equipment, generators for hospitals, aid for accommodation, food aid and 200 tonnes of seed potatoes to strengthen food security, rescue and fire-fighting equipment. Potato plants! To do what ? Plant them in fields ravaged by war? Do potatoes grow under the missiles?
2317	9	Alongside this and all these apparent good intentions, we have mainly provided defensive equipment for a value of 100 million euros: means of protection, optronic equipment, armaments and ammunition, Milan weapons systems - among others - responding to the needs expressed by Ukraine. And France continues to provide Ukraine with additional military capabilities, always officially in response to the needs expressed by the Ukrainian authorities and in coordination with its European and allied partners... To the needs expressed by Zelensky, unless it is those of the USA who are pushing Europe with all their might towards a 3rd World War? The question may arise.
2317	11	Who is Macron kidding? On the one hand we are sending help and on the other the means to kill, destroy and fight to the last Ukrainian… Macron is replaying for us the story of the little pig that we fatten to roast it better at Christmas or pampered, pampered and well-fed Easter lamb to better slaughter it in the spring.
2317	13	For its part, since March 2, the Russian Federation has delivered 20,437.4 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Real help, consisting of medicines, foodstuffs, blankets, etc. 1,017 humanitarian actions were carried out on the ground in the cities that suffered from the bombardments. More than 23,000 tonnes of basic necessities have been collected from collection points in Russia for their next shipment.
2317	15	"Certainly the unfortunate will tell me that it is the least that Russia can do after having ""invaded"" Ukraine, that Russia has ""attacked"" Ukraine. Once and for all, NO! Russia has neither attacked nor invaded Ukraine. Russia has just responded to the call for help from the inhabitants of the Donbass region threatened by the Ukrainian army massed at its door."
23170	3	When will we see the French State, depositary according to the law of legitimate violence, bring down the Abdeslams, the Merahs and other Kouachi brothers who are legion in France?
23170	5	When the hens will have teeth or when the French will have driven out the globalist caste represented by Macron?
23170	7	According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two Palestinians aged 25 and 28 were killed during an Israeli-led operation in the West Bank. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 19 other people were injured, ten of whom were shot.
23170	9	Two Palestinians were killed and 19 others injured on the night of July 23 to 24 in Nablus, during new night operations carried out in the occupied West Bank by the Israeli army, which explained that it wanted to apprehend people wanted for their involvement in attacks. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, Mouhamad Azizi (25) was shot in the chest and Abdul Rahman Suleiman Sobh (28) was shot in the head. The Palestinian Red Crescent also reported 19 wounded, including ten by live ammunition.
23170	11	The Israeli army claimed to have carried out “counterterrorism operations” in the West Bank overnight. She reported “exchanges of fire between armed suspects and troops” during an operation in Nablus, in the north of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. “Explosive devices and stones were thrown in the direction of soldiers” Israeli in Nablus “by rioters who also opened fire in the direction of the troops”, added the army, which claims to have responded with “anti-riot means and live ammunition”.
23170	13	"""A total of four individuals suspected of terrorist activities were arrested overnight"" during Israeli operations in the West Bank, the army said in its statement."
23170	15	The Israeli Prime Minister evokes an “effective and successful” operation, the Palestinian presidency denounces a “crime”
23170	17	"Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said during his cabinet meeting on July 24 that ""the army, the Shin Bet [internal security service] and the Yamam [police commando] had raided the hideouts of wanted persons in Nablus that night""."
23170	19	These are terrorists who have recently carried out attacks with firearms,” he added. “We are not going to sit and wait for them to attack Israeli citizens,” he argued, praising an “efficient and successful” operation by the security forces.
23170	21	The spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, Nabil Abou Roudeina, denounced a “new […] Israeli crime which will not undermine the determination and the will of our people”, in remarks reproduced by the public agency Wafa. “The region will remain in a cycle of violence until [it achieves] an end to the [Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories] and a just peace,” he said.
23170	23	Since the end of March, Israeli security forces have been carrying out almost daily operations in the West Bank following a series of attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank in which 19 people, mostly civilians, have lost his life.
23173	3	In Avdeevka, in the Donetsk People's Republic, the neo-Nazis, under the pretext of being saved from artillery fire, brought civilians to the territory of the coking plant and held them as a “human shield”. At the same time, in the enterprise, militants placed artillery and LRMs, from which they systematically shell nearby settlements.
23173	5	The purpose of these cynical actions of the Ukrainian nationalists is to provoke a retaliatory fire, after which, according to an already worked out scenario with wide media coverage, accuse the Russian Armed Forces and the formations of the Donetsk People's Republic of death of civilians following seemingly indiscriminate strikes.
23173	7	Such facts of flagrant violations of international humanitarian law by the kyiv regime continue to be ignored by the international community and international organizations.
23173	9	The Ministry of Defense of Russia calls on the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organizations to have an impact on the official kyiv and to take effective measures to prevent the Ukraine's armed groups' use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes. Al Jazeera: SSU chief fired over intelligence leak, attorney general fired over bribes
23174	1	Ukrainian soldiers serving as lab rats? Russia claims to have found two more American military biological laboratories in the liberated territories of Donbass...
23174	3	The advance of the Russian army makes it possible to discover what was happening on Ukrainian territories controlled by American and NATO forces. Two more biological military laboratories were discovered in the liberated territory of Lugansk, in Rubezhnoe and Severodonetsk. Moreover, information concerning the state of health of the Ukrainian soldiers shows that they were clearly used as laboratory mice. Let's see how long this text will remain published, without being withdrawn, like the previous one on these American programs for financing military biological laboratories in Ukraine.
23174	5	According to Russian sources, so far discreet, the Russian army found two American biological laboratories in the cities of Rubezhnoe and Severodonetsk, on the territory of the Lugansk region.
23174	7	As the withdrawal of the Ukrainian army was rapid, it was not possible to remove or destroy the contents of these laboratories, but everything was carefully mined. The representatives of the police are on site, as well as the experts, in order to understand what was going on in these laboratories.
23174	9	Recall that, with supporting documents, the Russian Ministry of Defense declared on March 6 of this year that the United States spent more than 200 million dollars for Ukrainian military biological laboratories:
23174	11	As can be seen from the report, the Pentagon and the Department of Defense Threat Reduction Administration (DTRA), as well as Black & Veatch (Overland Park, Kansas) and CH2M Hill (Englewood, Colorado) participated in the program on the American side, and the Kievsky Gromashevsky Research Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, Institute of Veterinary Medicine (kyiv), Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (kyiv), Mechnikov Institute of Microbiology and Immunology (Kharkiv), the Ukrainian Plague Research Center (Odessa), Lvov Research Institute of Epidemiology and Hygiene.
23174	13	Of the thirty Ukrainian laboratories that participated in the American military program, 11 laboratories of the central sanitary-epidemiological department of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense took part in monitoring the biological situation, the selection and transfer of strains, etc. In addition, during this monitoring, pathogen access control (PACS) was introduced. The Russian Ministry of Defense further clarifies:
23174	15	It should be noted that strains and biomaterials were collected and transferred to the US Army Reed Research Institute. These are samples of highly pathogenic strains of pathogens of infectious diseases (plague, anthrax, cholera, tularemia, brucellosis, Crimean-Congo virus, hantavirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and leptospirosis), as well as 4000 biomedical samples from members of the Ukrainian army.
23174	17	Since then, Russian doctors have been examining Ukrainian military prisoners and have made strange discoveries, confirming that these soldiers have been the subject of medical experimentation for years, because their rate of illness is well above the normal average:
23174	19	"""A third of the soldiers examined had (or are currently ill) with hepatitis A, more than four percent had a fever with renal syndrome, another twenty percent suffered from a disease with the exotic name of West Nile fever""."
23175	3	The Ministry of Defense of Russia at a briefing on the results of the analysis of documents concerning the military biological activity of the United States on the territory of Ukraine, disclosed the circumstances of the program of study of tick infections, which were dealt with by microbiologists in the United States within the framework of three DTRA (Threat Reduction Management, within the structure of the Pentagon) projects.
23175	5	The Ministry of Defense of Russia reported on the American projects UP-1 and UP-8 funded by DTRA, cycles of research on the vital activity of tick infections in Ukraine. A project to study ixode mites, which carry a number of particularly dangerous infections (tularemia, West Nile fever, Crimean Congo fever), has been reported separately. According to the ministry, specialists from the University of Texas participated in the implementation of the latter.
23175	7	It was reported that the collection of ticks was carried out mainly in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine, where there are natural foci of infections, which are characteristic of the territory of Russia.
23175	9	It is noteworthy that the implementation of American projects on the study of tick-borne infections coincided with a significant increase in the incidence of tick-borne borreliosis in the Ukrainian population. At the same time, an increase in the tick population has been reported in several Russian regions on the border with Ukraine. It is reported that this circumstance is already being studied by specialized Russian experts together with specialists from the Russian Ministry of Defense.
23175	11	“Previously, we highlighted the importance of the results of military biology projects codenamed UP for the Pentagon. Note the report prepared for the US military department by the companies Black&Veatch and Metabiota. According to the document, simultaneously with the UP projects in Ukraine, “Veterinarian projects” with the figure TAP were implemented”, – said the Ministry of defense.
23175	13	"The main goal of the UP projects, according to the Department of Defense, which included studies of tick-borne diseases, is to identify ""economically significant quarantine infections"" that can harm people or agricultural activities in the level of regions or entire countries."
23176	1	The specter of the decline of Western unity
23176	3	For example, Americans often talk compulsively about guns, which they see as a way to ensure their personal safety. This is because they are sorely lacking in personal security: at any moment, a crazed maniac armed to the teeth (there are millions of them roaming freely among them) could come and attack them and wipe them out - while they're sleeping, picking up their kids from school, sitting on the toilet, or bending down to pick up a penny. So they arm themselves to the teeth and live in a state of paranoid rage.
23176	5	"Another example: American leaders compulsively mention “freedom and democracy”. These are things that they are supposed to have and that they must spread to the rest of the planet, whether the planet likes it or not. Specifically, the rest of the planet should not be allowed to democratically vote against this American “freedom and democracy” nonsense and be blissfully free from it. Since the United States itself is not a democracy (as can easily be proven with numbers), what American politicians mean by ""democracy"" is anything but."
23176	7	But most of the planet has already understood, on its own, what is or is not “democratic” in American parlance: those who follow American dictates are democratic; those who wish to follow their own advice are undemocratic. That's all there is to it: democrats are obedient while disobedients are dictators who must be overthrown. Since this scheme is obviously selfish and silly, the circle of obedience keeps shrinking and now only includes EU and NATO countries, plus Anglo-Saxon countries and a few scattered colonies and dependencies. And even that circle is now visibly fraying at the edges.
23176	9	"And that brings us to the next much-desired, but sorely needed, phantom entity to be compulsively conjured up at every international gathering where US or EU officials are present: The Unity of the West. , in pursuit of which all kinds of stupid and self-destructive actions are attempted, whether throwing money and weapons at Ukrainian thieves (regardless of where they go) or imposing self-destructive sanctions to Russia (regardless of what its own people will heat their homes or grow their food with). Since the substance behind these futile actions becomes rather toxic as a topic of public discourse, discussions tend to short-circuit to public displays of unity rather than unified actions: ""Hey look, everyone, we gave the Ukrainians a few more bullets, thus delaying their inevitable defeat for a few more seconds! »"
23176	11	Some manifestations of Western unity are so pathetically self-destructive that they deserve special mention. The hapless little Baltic states are ruled by people whose main ambition is to produce pathetic displays of Western unity in opposition to “Russian aggression” when their real fear is that Russia will simply ignore them. That's what the Americans told them to do, and that's what they will do, no offense to their local people.
23176	13	Thus, the Lithuanian leadership, in a paroxysm of suicidal madness, blocked Russian transit through Lithuanian territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. They said they were just following EU sanctions against Russia; however, these sanctions say nothing about transit between the Russian enclave and Russia and apply to Russian trade with the EU. In addition, a permanent agreement between Russia and the EU specifically allows this type of transit. In a rare show of common sense, EU leaders and then Germany told Lithuania, in very clear terms, to stop. This plunged the Lithuanian leaders into a state of stupor in which they have persisted for almost a week now.
23176	15	And then there's this nifty little fact: while Russia can shift all Kaliningrad traffic onto ferries between that port and its recently built gigantic port at Ust'-Luga (Leningrad region), it can also literally block all Lithuania (as well as neighboring Latvia and Estonia) by stopping all rail traffic between Poland and Lithuania, which must pass through Kaliningrad. Indeed, the railways in the Baltic countries are on the wider Russian gauge, and the point of transfer between the wagons which use the European rails of 1435 mm and those which use the Russian gauge of 1520 mm used in all of the former USSR is in Kaliningrad. Stopping this transfer would roughly halve the Baltic economies, which are already losing momentum (inflation in Lithuania is above 20%).
23176	17	But Lithuania's freakout is just a pathetic little sideshow. The main show of Western unity was supposed to center on the G7 meeting held at a secluded German castle, Schloss Elmau, far from the raging crowds of protesters. In this isolated place, representatives of the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Canada, France and Japan were supposed to demonstrate their unity regarding Russian activities in the former Ukraine. Since all their previous decisions had no effect on Russia's position, some people expressed high hopes that decisive action would result from this gathering. It is interesting to note that at this gathering, two chaperones from the European Union (Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel) were also present; thus, not only Western unity is sorely lacking, but also Western sovereignty.
23176	19	The first element of this decisive action was the American proposal to sanction sales of Russian gold, which represents 10% of total world production. Germany, France and Italy did not support this courageous initiative, relying on other EU members, who were not present, and the proposal fell like a lead balloon. .
23176	21	The second new element is the proposal to cap the price of Russian oil. The modalities of capping by the G7 of a product controlled by Russia were left to the appreciation of the participants, who no longer heard of it.
23176	23	If the cap was above the market price for Russian crude, then the cap would operate empty; if it were lower, then Russia would simply refuse to sell at that price. In response, the world price of oil would immediately soar higher. Russia would then be able to offer preferred customer discounts to its non-G7 buyers, pocket the windfall and, perhaps, use it to buy more missiles to take down the last Nazis. Ukrainians. Take that, Putin!
23176	25	The subject of Ukraine was an incidental, albeit very necessary, diversion from the originally planned main theme of the G7 meeting: the fight against climate change. Here, most of the talk has been about returning to the use of fossil fuels. In this sense, unity has prevailed, but at the cost of throwing overboard any dreams of climate change mitigation.
23176	27	The initial impetus behind the climate change steamroller was to show virtue by installing many expensive wind and solar farms in wealthy western countries, while threatening to impose all kinds of fines and fees on less wealthy nations that are forced to burn dirty, climate-warming coal in order to make products that the West buys with printed money. But now that this scheme has failed, the West is no longer wealthy and, after refusing to use Russia's clean and plentiful natural gas, is busy reopening its mothballed coal-fired power plants and finding enough coal to fuel them. Meanwhile, the green diary is thrown out the window. The forgotten Greta Tunberg briefly made headlines; poor Greta is now suspected of being a Russian agent!
23176	29	Interestingly, coal is good for providing base load but useless for fast maneuvering, which makes it incompatible with the variable and intermittent power generation of wind and solar farms; therefore, these expensive toys will have to remain disconnected from the network most of the time. It's also worth noting that Russia supplies around a fifth of the world's coal exports and won't really be affected when the EU switches from Russian natural gas (a relatively clean fuel that can be used directly for transportation and which is very useful as a raw material for making many products, from plastics to fertilizers) to Russian coal (which is not nearly as versatile). Again, take that, Putin!
23176	31	Ukraine was the next item on the agenda. It was quickly recognized that the G7 can do nothing to stop Russia's special military operation in the former Ukraine. Moreover, Western unity has proved elusive, with Britain's Boris Johnson warning French President Emmanuel Macron that now was not the time to talk about a diplomatic solution. Considering that the day before the summit began, the United States and Germany called for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, this is not Boris Johnson's most unifying gesture; but the latter really needs Ukraine to stay on fire for as long as possible to distract his constituents from his country's dire economic situation and the ongoing scandals within his own cabinet. Unlike Germany, Britain is not (yet) inundated with obnoxious Ukrainian migrants, many of whom are allergic to work and feel entitled to government handouts.
23176	33	"As is now the tradition in Western gatherings, the assembled dignitaries pulled out the Ouija board and invoked the spirit of Zelensky, the summoned Ukrainian president. As usual, Zelensky begged for more weapons (to sell to terrorists or for the Russians to destroy before they reached the front lines). When the Bundeskanzler Scholz was later asked if he could offer specific guarantees regarding Ukraine, he displayed his usual quirky sense of humor by saying, ""Yes, I could"", immediately followed by "" that's all ""."
23176	35	The only concrete step taken was the acceptance of a $600 billion infrastructure plan to promote green energy in Africa, Latin America and Asia. This is a symbolic gesture intended to counter the Chinese Road and Belt initiative. To this end, representatives from South Africa, India, Indonesia, Argentina and Senegal have been invited to the G7. There was a fairly transparent desire for these countries to join the good fight against Russia in the former Ukraine. How did it go ?
23176	37	South Africa is a member of the BRICS whose main members are Russia and China. The BRICS emerged as an important non-Western counterweight to the G7. So is India, which is now a major buyer of Russian crude oil and exports refined petroleum products to the United States and elsewhere. Argentina has declared its intention to join the BRICS, as has Iran. Senegal, which currently chairs the African Union, was one of the first countries to send its leader to Moscow after the start of the special military operation in the former Ukraine last February. None of the representatives of these countries said an accusatory word about it at the G7 gathering, before or after.
23176	39	So, other than the phantom $600 billion deal to maybe build a few wind and solar farms in various remote parts of the world, nothing at all was achieved at the G7, which shows the futility of existence. of this organization.
23176	41	"Now let's move on to the NATO summit, which took place on June 29-30 in Madrid, and which was also supposed to demonstrate a unity of the West against Russia that did not materialize. Germany and France insisted on preserving the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation signed in 1997. However, while this document describes Russia as a partner, the Current NATO doctrinal documents view Russia as the alliance's primary threat. To that end, NATO plans to increase the size of its ""high readiness"" contingent in Eastern Europe to 300,000 troops, bringing it closer to the size of the Ukrainian army last February, which the Russians repulsed and practically destroyed in three months with a small fraction of their army."
23176	43	In a show of unity with France and Germany, the representative of Poland, Zbigniew Rau, said that Poland considers the Founding Act to be obsolete, as evidenced by NATO's expansion on the front eastern, while Scholz declared that it was still in force. Poland seems to be increasingly under British tutelage. The British are anxious to secure a new source of cannon fodder after fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian, and the Poles, by some quirk of their national character, are always ready and willing to do just that should not.
23176	45	The main intrigue of the NATO summit was the acceptance or non-acceptance of Sweden and Finland into NATO. Sweden has been neutral since the Treaty of Nystad in 1721; Finland, after being liberated from Sweden, then gaining independence from Russia, then fighting against Russia alongside Hitler's troops, took an oath of neutrality at the Treaty of Paris in 1947. membership of these two countries in NATO directly violates the terms of these treaties and constitutes a violation of the sovereignty of these countries; in other words, Russia would no longer be legally bound to respect the borders of these countries or maintain legal relations with their governments.
23176	47	"These intricacies of international law may make no difference to the collective and highly unified West that chooses to inhabit its own solipsistic ""rules-based international order"" (the rules being somewhat ad hoc, created as and when extent, in Washington), but for the rest of the world, the primacy of treaties over national law is fundamental and legal relations with Russia are essential."
23176	49	Regarding Russia, Putin said he was not opposed to Sweden and Finland joining NATO. Indeed, why would he oppose it? What's wrong with these two small defenseless countries, symbolically supported by the fractured and tottering juggernaut that is NATO, choosing to throw themselves into the bear's mouth by flouting their obligations conventional? (Specifically, according to the Paris Treaty, Finland's decision to join a military alliance must be approved by the UN Security Council, and this approval was not even sought).
23176	51	But it might not go that far. In order for Sweden and Finland to join NATO, Turkish President Erdogan has demanded that they stop supporting Kurdish terrorists and that they deport to Turkey those whom the latter wants to try. The Kurdish faction is politically quite powerful in Sweden and it may well overthrow the Swedish government in response to these attempts to destroy it. And Finland said it wouldn't join NATO if Sweden didn't. At the NATO summit, Erdogan reluctantly gave his approval, but with many conditions, and the final decision now rests with the Turkish parliament. So much for NATO unity.
23176	53	On the very important topic of the former Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made his usual speech about unwavering support for Ukraine, but no one said a single word in favor of the offer of real security guarantees. NATO offers non-lethal support, but lethal weapons can only come from individual NATO members, Stoltenberg said.
23176	55	Biden further clarified the situation by stating that the United States will stand with Ukraine to ensure that it...does not win. (That is, the Russians don't win, he later changed his story.) That level of honesty, when the task is to lie, can only come from an insane mind. According to CNN, a debate is raging in the White House over what could be considered a Ukrainian victory, since declaring victory and going home, regardless of the outcome, is what Americans typically try to do. Perhaps the mere fact that kyiv has not yet been occupied by Russian forces is enough to declare this an overall victory?
23176	57	A discussion on the placement of small NATO contingents in the former Ukrainian territory, far from the front line, did not succeed, for fear of an escalation of the situation with Russia. Consensus on this initiative was difficult to obtain. All in all, NATO seemed to take a perfectly passive position vis-à-vis Russia with regard to the former Ukraine. In response, the Western media prepared public opinion to accept the idea of ​​a negotiated peace settlement in the former Ukraine.
23176	59	But is it even possible? Russia follows an easy and flawless logic. If a formerly Ukrainian territory is populated by Russians who want to be with Russia, then it must be liberated. Lugansk region is free since yesterday, Donetsk region is next. Kherson is almost free, but Kharkov, Zaporozhye and Nikolaev are unfinished business. And there was never any doubt in anyone's mind that Odessa is also Russian. Oh, and let's not forget Dnepropetrovsk and Sumy. Is kyiv Russian? Well, it has been for most of the past thousand years, give or take a decade!
23176	61	"But liberating that territory alone would still subject it to bombardment from long-range Ukrainian weapons, many of which are supplied by the West. Therefore, the Russians cannot stop and must free even more territory - which also becomes subject to attack. Since the line between Ukrainians and Russians is notoriously blurred, there is no obvious stopping point to this process until Russian territory directly adjoins NATO-occupied territory. At that point, the Russians are likely to say, ""Sure, let's make a deal."""
23176	63	There is also no domestic political reason to stop: public opinion approves the special military operation in the former Ukraine at 72%, Putin's personal popularity rating is reaching historic heights, information from the evening are full of brave liberators being welcomed with open arms by newly liberated residents, who are lining up in droves to receive their Russian passports, all intercut with photos of destroyed schools, kindergartens and apartment buildings by the retreating Ukrainian artillery. The message of the inhabitants to the Russian troops is: “Keep going! »
23176	65	On the other hand, there are very good reasons not to negotiate with the Ukrainian regime. First, it is in no way sovereign or autonomous. Zelensky's mostly British bodyguard protects him from his own Nazi fanatics; at the same time, his orders come directly from Washington. Negotiating with the EU over the former Ukraine has been attempted before, and at this stage Russia has no reason to trust the EU. And there is also no reason to negotiate with the United States over the former Ukraine, because why should the United States be there?
23176	67	In fact, the United States should probably retreat within its own borders and give serious thought to important issues such as abortion, gun control, and national bankruptcy. If the G7 and NATO still pretend to listen to them, the rest of the world is no longer as attentive.
23176	69	Take, for example, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, who will be the next host of the G20 gathering. Biden asked him to expel Russia from the G20 in response to the special military operation. Instead, Widodo traveled to Moscow and signed two important deals: a $13 billion deal to build an oil refinery with the help of Russian company Rosneft and another with RZhD, the Russian national railway company, for the construction of 190 km of railways.
23176	71	America's ability to command the world is over. The unipolar world is dead; nor is the world multipolar, it is non-polar. Nobody is particularly concerned with precisely defining one or the other of these new poles. Countries are no longer found along a spectrum or even on a map: they are in a multidimensional mesh.
23176	73	"Look at the status of all major Western projects. The idea of ​​a transition to green energy to fight global warming is dead; apparently coal is the new hydrogen. (Maybe it's Obama's ""clean coal"".) The Great Reset has gone the way of the coronavirus. The “Build Back Better” turned into the “Break Back Faster”. All this nonsense is dying a long and painful death on the ashes of the old Ukraine. A big chunk of the old world order has fallen off the landing gear of a jet taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan. The rest will be swept away when the kyiv regime collapses and dies."
23176	75	"Even the most westernized countries are discovering, one by one, that the American way leads nowhere. Today, the question of maintaining the unity of the West boils down to an old question: ""If all your friends jump off a cliff, do you jump too?"" »"
23176	77	"Henceforth, the appropriate background music for any speech on ""Western unity"" is a dirge."
23177	1	[Ukraine] Why is Russia not isolated from the rest of the world?
23178	3	For subscribers to the Amazon Prime service, it's a cold shower. The service of the American giant goes from 49 euros per year to 69.90 euros. A 40% jump in the price, a well-felt participation by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in the fight against inflation in the country of Emmanuel Macron. Amazon Prime is the service that gives you access to accelerated delivery of everything you order from the giant web supermarket and offers you shows, sports, movies, books or music.
23178	5	Of course, it plagues social networks where the French have the feeling of having had their finger stuck in the door. Especially since unsubscribing from the famous Amazon Prime does not look easy: Amazon has even been slapped on the subject. Something to think about the benefits of globalization dear to our politicians and their very chic and very fallible influencers for decades.
23178	7	"It was beautiful, Amazon, when he arrived in France. Children were told the story of Jeff Bezos, creator of this marvelous service with a computer and two strings. A benefactor of humanity, Jeff Bezos. Just think, he was selling books! Are you against books? You don't want people to be able to read freely and without breaking the bank? Are you for borders, as before? Do you prefer small businesses to multinationals that serve the same soup everywhere, invoice in France, collect profits in the United States and hire elsewhere? Bad ! Nerdy! Despite a brief controversy, despite Europe's useless posturing, the red carpet was quickly rolled out to Jeff Bezos when he moved to France in August 2000. The regions fought so that he could ""create jobs"" by opening its famous warehouses. Its drivers got into the habit of urinating into a bottle so as not to delay the delivery. We rubbed our hands. Roland-Garros, for example, sold part of its television rights to Jeff Bezos. It paid better than France Télévisions."
23178	9	In short, globalization promised to be happy, once again.
23178	11	The small independent booksellers have tried to resist. They stood up for some like vulgar unruly Gauls in front of the American bulldozer. In vain. Result ? According to the BDCOM 2020 survey on the state of shops in Paris (published on February 8, 2021 under the aegis of the Paris-Île-de-France Chamber of Commerce and the city of Paris), our neighborhood bookstores are disappearing without a look from our great globalizers. “Cultural and leisure businesses (around 5,300 stores), which have been declining since 2005, have also been fewer since 2017 (-5.1%, around -285 stores), impacted in particular by competition from online sales, explains this official report. It is particularly bookstores that have seen their workforce decrease more sharply than during the previous period (-58 in 3 years). The phenomenon applies to Paris and elsewhere. The book, Amazon's historic core business... Since then, we don't hear too much about booksellers. Some are subsidized by the state, they are silent. Others have disappeared, they are also silent. What French booksellers are not allowed to do (increase their prices, those of books), Jeff Bezos did with the snap of a finger.
23178	13	At least, Amazon, this company paragon of happy globalization, does France benefit from its expansion by recruiting at full capacity? We are so well, in France and in Europe! It's so much better for investors, France in Europe! Not like with these English stubborn as donkeys, locked in their Brexit which will ruin them, faith of globalist!
23178	15	"Alas, a very recent dispatch from Challenges and AFP dated July 15 has enough to rinse the last gogos admirers of the star flag. Amazon has chosen as a priority to expand its troops… the country of Boris Johnson! He will hire ""more than 4,000 additional people this year in the United Kingdom on permanent contracts"". “This should boost its workforce in the country to 75,000 people and make the group one of the top ten private employers in the UK,” the dispatch adds. In France, Amazon is more modestly aiming for the bar of 18,500 permanent employees by the end of the year: four times less. The price of the ruin of how many small businesses, bookstores and others! In the United Kingdom, “the Internet giant has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic and the confinements when the stores were closed, continues the AFP dispatch. In all, Amazon says it has created 40,000 jobs in the UK in three years. In the middle of Brexit! And to think that we were predicted the desperate and mass flight of large groups and English investors in a hurry to take refuge in France... No comment, as the English say."
23179	1	Laurence Haïm wants to send French children to die in Ukraine!
23179	3	“Are we ready to die for Ukraine and send the French children? Unfortunately the majority will say no. Laurence Haim.
23179	5	Note the unfortunately, it is therefore a misfortune that young French people do not die for Zelenski! How can a woman ask children to go and die on the mattress, to come back, at best, crippled? It's that she never had one, Laurence, we suspected a little: there is only a selfish and psychopathic being to want to send the children of others to the slaughterhouse! But how can she profess such monstrosities?
23179	7	Well, it's by Romanticism, yes, yes, Laurence claims that she is a little romantic!
23179	9	Romantic ?
23179	11	She would do better to revise her classics, the mainstream journalist, because the Romantics who went to fight, it was against the Turks, to defend the Christian Greek civilization, our civilization, against the Muslim Ottoman barbarism!
23179	13	The Child
23179	15	The Turks passed there. All is ruin and mourning.
23179	17	Chio, the island of wines, is no more than a dark reef,
23179	19	Chio, shaded by the arbors,
23179	21	Puppy, who in the waves reflected his great antlers,
23179	23	Its hillsides, its palaces, and in the evening sometimes
23179	25	A dancing choir of young girls.
23179	27	Everything is deserted. But no ; alone near the blackened walls,
23179	29	A child with blue eyes, a Greek child, seated,
23179	31	Bowed his humiliated head;
23179	33	He had for asylum, he had for support
23179	35	A white hawthorn, a flower, like him
23179	37	In the great havoc forgotten.
23179	39	Ah! poor child, barefoot on the angular rocks!
23179	41	Alas! to wipe the tears from your blue eyes
23179	43	Like the sky and like the wave,
23179	45	So that in their azure, with stormy tears,
23179	47	Passes the bright flash of joy and games,
23179	49	To raise your blond head,
23179	51	What do you want ? Beautiful child, what do you have to give
23179	53	To reattach cheerfully and cheerfully bring back
23179	55	In curls on your white shoulder
23179	57	This hair, which iron has not suffered the affront,
23179	59	And who weep scattered around your beautiful forehead,
23179	61	Like the leaves on the willow?
23179	63	Who could dissipate your cloudy sorrows?
23179	65	Is it to have the lily, blue like your blue eyes,
23179	67	Who from Iran borders the dark well?
23179	69	Or the fruit of the tuba, of this tree so tall,
23179	71	That a galloping horse puts, always running,
23179	73	A hundred years out of its shadow?
23179	75	Do you want, to smile at me, a beautiful bird of the woods,
23179	77	Who sings with a song sweeter than the oboe,
23179	79	Brighter than cymbals?
23179	81	What do you want ? flower, beautiful fruit, or the marvelous bird?
23179	83	– Friend, said the Greek child, said the blue-eyed child,
23179	85	I want powder and bullets.
23179	87	July 8-10, 1828
23179	89	Victor Hugo, Les Orientales.
23179	91	There you go, Romantics! From Lord Byron, who died in Greece to defend the Hellenes, to Delacroix, painting the massacres of Scio, I can affirm by making the dead speak, the famous prosopopoeia dear to Raphaël Enthoven, that the Romantics would gladly read Riposte laïque and would vomit up these crazy progressives and uneducated!
23179	93	Besides, who can want to die for Zelensky? The man who embezzled $850 million by robbing his people, his people who have since been condemned either to exile or to misery and death? Die for Zelensky? the leader of the ukronazis, the most corrupt head of state in Europe? Die for Zelensky? Old comic not funny, like this one who was a failed painter?
23179	95	You have to be in the bottom of journalism to make such appalling and imbecile remarks!
23179	97	But should we be surprised? Just look at the pedigree of this so-called journalist! And there everything is explained.
23179	99	On January 10, 2017, she announced her departure from the I-Télé channel and, the next day, joined the campaign team of Macrounet, candidate for the presidential election as spokesperson, where she deals with international issues. . She is so bad that Macron fires her, that is to say his level, while he will have Sibeth N'Diaye and Benjamin Griveau in his team! And without giving her the ambassadorship she coveted!
23179	101	In October 2017, she acted as resident researcher at the Institute of Political Studies at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, directed by David Axelrod, an adviser to Barack Obama.
23179	103	Here, the mass is said, Laurence Haïm is not a journalist, but a press attaché of the Macronist power and an Atlanticist agent of the Democratic Party. In the past, this was called a political commissar, and this breed is currently infesting television sets.
23179	105	What ? She was a journalist at the time, you tell me?
23179	107	Let's talk about it ! She has always been the shame of her profession, where however there is fierce competition for this title! I leave aside all her tweets and articles, treasures of bad faith and bias, where she explained to us worse than to hang on Donald Trump, until drooling on his wife Melania, in a report that made history as it is curious of nullity, no, no, what I will remember is that she sold during the American election campaign the so positive image of Joe Biden, this dynamic candidate, who was going to astonish the world.
23179	109	Astonishing the world is not false in a sense! To elect a man whom his son Hunter tenderly describes as Pedo-Peter, who falls off his bicycle, who falls asleep at each interview, who is unable to read his teleprompter for more than three minutes, who stammers incoherent remarks, which gets lost in the gardens of the White House, but which possesses the nuclear codes of the world's leading power, there is indeed something to be surprised about!
23179	111	But Laurence Haïm is best known for her bogus reports, as shown by a few examples below!
23179	113	But sometimes she outdoes herself, she says this week that Russia has built 15,000 universities in Africa! There, she excels in anything!
23179	115	Here, to support Macron and his policy of vassalage vis-à-vis the USA, the so-called news channels draw on the bottom of journalism, and we, we have to gulp down the dregs of journalists: Generals Gamelin, pedophiles, cocaine-addicted or rogue philosophers, habitual criminals, agents of Atlanticist influence… These people never give us any information, they stuff us day and night with this ridiculous propaganda fabricated by kyiv, well seasoned with adulterated moraline. Disgusting !
2318	1	Let's stop with the health panic and get to work
2318	3	We need to get people back to work rather than creating a health panic.
2318	5	In the absence of the publication of covid statistics proving that the current pandemic is even stronger than all the previous ones but even less dangerous, politicians and their acolytes in the medical world nevertheless continue to cause fear, as well as the very many covid quarantines linked to cases contact that are squarely imposed on companies whose absent staff cause daily malfunctions. All companies suffer from this evil and no longer know how to fill their teams and therefore slow down by producing less. Let's not talk about the brilliant invention telework to improve its living environment but not that of companies.
2318	7	Thus the restaurateurs, these damned of the Earth described as inhuman slavers are reduced to limiting their opening days for lack of staff.
2318	9	Two years of confinement and fear have changed mentalities. Why go to work when you can earn little less by staying at home? Why work weekends when you can enjoy your family and this new left-wing French way of life (work less, demonstrate every Saturday, decry those bastards of bosses who get rich on the backs of poor workers, etc.) .)?
2318	10	Work is no longer a Western value
2318	12	In Luxembourg, one of my starred restaurant friends is looking for a sommelier: 3000 euros net, weekends and public holidays closed, 12 weeks of annual leave: he can't find anyone! Of course he has a high level of requirement and that is perhaps the problem. It is excluded that he hires a sommelier without any experience other than his claim to earn the maximum.
2318	14	On the other hand, you will have to get used to being served by Ukrainian refugees who, in addition to a solid level of education (the Ukrainian children are frightened to note the low level of the German children), really want to rebuild their lives by working to earn more than the ridiculous allowances of our dear welfare state!
2318	16	Another problem with this particular profession: our nanny state prohibits tips other than those declared. At one time, it was the hall that commanded and it was impossible to refuse a late arrival. The cooks who shared the tips didn't mind. In return, the poultry was cut up in front of the customer, as well as the flambé pancakes. It was the great show produced by real professionals who loved their job but also copiously rounded off their end of the month. In short, everyone was there.
2318	18	In today's world it is the diverse and varied hypochondriacs and intolerants who dictate the menu. The taste, the sharing, the pleasure of the table are incidental... As a result, the quality of what we eat is at its lowest: reheated industrial food, ingredients bought at Metro on promotion, origins of meat unknown or from Poland or the Denmark, scrap from old culled cows. The food debacle...
2318	19	All this has a price: our health and the survival of businesses!
2318	21	Our politicians dream of re-industrialisation: the good joke! People need to get back to work and stop selling them saving the planet, parity or bullying or wokism. Work must once again become a value. Starting by revaluing learning by allowing, as in Switzerland, business-school bridges at any age and no longer these higher education courses that produce technocrats and theoreticians completely disconnected from the realities of life.
2318	23	But as we are led by these same technocrats from Sciences Po or Ena, the fight is unequal and the future hopeless….
2318	25	There are 7 million people in France who go to the soup kitchen, but there are also 15,000 professional tattoo artists! All is said….

Tabled by the socialist deputy Christine Pirès Beaune, the amendment to the amending finance bill provided for an ""exceptional tax of 25% on the superprofits"" of the various companies, oil and gas, maritime transport or motorway concessionaires."

23180	15	The Macronian right has once again shown who is boss, his boss: the powerful multinational lobby. For the French, after Islamist terrorism (2015-2016), police terrorism (on yellow vests, from 2018 to 2019) and health terrorism (2020-2021), here is economic terrorism (2022-). Curiously enough, each streak lasts about two years. Could this be the time for the French to open their eyes to the real sponsors of these categorical terrorism?

23180	50	— A__SATURDAY (@_saturday_) July 24, 2022
23181	1	France is selling a country that does not exist to the Japanese!
23181	3	Despite government announcements, France no longer attracts many foreigners, especially that of Mayor Hidalgo!
23181	5	Horrified by dirt, violence, immigration, the reckless or uninformed who risk it return from their journey more than disappointed and let it be known.
23181	7	However, they did not benefit from the reception of the prefect Lallement reserved for British supporters at the Stade de France…
23181	9	"Attendance at Saint-Denis Cathedral is steadily declining, which is easily understandable, as the surroundings are so risky and as Thierry Henry said: “Saint-Denis is not Paris! "". It's not even France anymore."
23181	11	So in an attempt to attract customers from elsewhere, Atout France, France's tourist development agency, is increasing charm operations and communication campaigns, events, actions aimed at the press and e-influencers, or trade fairs. professionals, etc
23181	13	His latest creation is a cartoon intended to seduce the Japanese.
23181	15	In addition to the silliness worthy of a children's film, the images are misleading as they describe a delicious dreamland where it is good to live, walk and have fun.
23181	17	The shameless lies of Darmanin and Dupond-Moretti can no longer conceal that France has become a cutthroat, often very dirty, poorly maintained and dangerous for many reasons.
23181	19	In Paris, tourists are regularly victims of assault and theft… and it is not good to walk around the capital of romance at night.
23181	21	The foreign media, not enslaved to Macron, do not fail to relay images, videos and articles showing the new France, its inhabitants and its current habits and customs...
23181	23	Very sensitive to cleanliness and safety, the Japanese will certainly not be trapped by this cartoon too good to be true.
23181	25	All that's missing are a host of very cute tamed Norway rats, friendly brightening up our parks and gardens.
23184	1	"Taiwan: Xi Jinping tells Joe Biden not to ""play with fire"""
23184	3	"The American and Chinese presidents spoke for more than two hours without making any concrete progress, in particular on the sensitive subject of Taiwan. ""Those who play with fire end up getting burned (...) I hope the American side fully understands this,"" threatened Xi Jinping. A face-to-face meeting is scheduled later."
23184	5	"More than two hours of maintenance. For their fifth telephone conversation, US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping spared no time to have, according to Washington and Beijing, a ""frank and in-depth"" dialogue. A formula which, in diplomatic language, means that the disagreements are far from having been ironed out."
23184	7	"The only real positive step forward was that the pair agreed to meet one-on-one and ""agreed that their teams would work to find a mutually agreeable time to do so."" The date of this meeting therefore remains to be defined, while the two heads of state have never spoken other than virtually or by telephone since the inauguration of Joe Biden."
23184	9	Taiwan at the center of tensions between the two men
23184	11	For the rest, during their interview, the two heads of state stuck to their positions and seem to delight in a dialogue of the deaf. And especially on the highly sensitive issue of Taiwan.
23184	13	"As Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, plans to travel to Taipei, Xi Jinping issued an explicit warning to Joe Biden: ""those who play with fire end up getting burned"", warned the Chinese president, repeating word for word the remarks made by the American president during a previous interview last November."
23184	15	"“I hope that the American side understands this perfectly,” added the Chinese number one, while Beijing has been upwind for several days against the announced visit of Nancy Pélosi to Taiwan and describes it as “provocation”. A warning to which Joe Biden responded by stressing that the position of the United States on Taiwan had ""not changed""."
23184	17	Status quo on the question of customs tariffs
23184	19	"Same status quo on the question of customs tariffs between the two economies. According to the White House, on this issue, ""President Biden explained to President Xi (...) the central problem of China's unfair trade practices that harm workers and families in the United States, but he did not did not discuss potential actions he might take. That is to say a possible lifting of the 25% customs duties imposed by Donald Trump at the height of trade tensions between the two countries."
23184	21	Nothing seems to be taking shape on this ground even if Washington sends many signals to criticize the customs policy put in place by Trump. “We believe (…) that the tariffs that were put in place [by the previous administration, editor’s note] were poorly thought out”, for example declared a little earlier in the week John Kirby, the spokesperson for the White House. Before adding that “we think they have increased costs for American families and small businesses, as well as for ranchers. And that without really tackling some of China's business practices. »
23184	23	The Chinese press points the finger at American responsibility
23184	25	"In fact, the day after this interview, if the Chinese press recognizes the importance of this exchange, it has a good game to return the ball to the United States for the responsibility for a large part of the tensions between Beijing and Washington. If in an editorial published this Friday the ""Global Times"" recognizes that the remarks made by the American president are ""relatively positive"", he also believes that relations between the two world powers have ""stagnant and have even deteriorated""."
23184	27	In question, according to the daily known for its nationalism, the fact that “the words of President Biden have not been translated into action”. And to explain that the improvement of the Sino-American dialogue will continue to depend on the attitude of Washington.
23186	1	"""Pushback"" of migrants in Greece: Frontex overwhelmed by a report"
23186	3	The former management of the border surveillance agency Frontex was aware of the illegal deportations of migrants to Greece and would even have co-financed deportations, according to a damning report from which Der Spiegel publishes extracts this Thursday.
23186	5	A damning report. A confidential document from the European Anti-Fraud Office (Olaf) consulted by the German magazine Der Spiegel, accuses the former management of Frontex - European Border and Coast Guard Agency - of having had knowledge illegal deportations of migrants to Greece and even co-funding deportations.
23186	7	Frontex was aware early on of these illegal, sometimes brutal, returns of asylum seekers to Turkey, say the authors of this report. “Instead of preventing pushbacks, former boss Fabrice Leggeri and his collaborators concealed them. They lied to the European Parliament and masked the fact that the agency supported certain refoulements with European taxpayers' money”, sums up the German magazine. The conclusions of the investigators had caused the resignation of Fabrice Leggeri.
23186	9	The report reveals many details. Like when the Greek coast guard, on August 5, 2020, dragged an inflatable boat with 30 migrants on board not towards Greece, but towards Turkey. A patrolling Frontex plane filmed the scene.
23186	11	Instead of approaching the Greek authorities, Frontex stopped patrolling planes over the Aegean Sea, on the grounds that the agency needed them elsewhere.
23186	13	The investigators cite testimonies from Frontex collaborators implicating Fabrice Leggeri for having turned a blind eye to these illegal acts. And they found a written note referring to the withdrawal of the surveillance planes “so as not to be a witness”.
23186	15	A Pushback co-financed by Frontex
23186	17	That's not all. Olaf also reports that at least six Greek boats, co-financed by Frontex, were allegedly involved in more than a dozen pushbacks between April and December 2020. The former director has always rejected these accusations. Asked, a spokesperson for the European Commission announced that “a series of measures” had already been put in place to settle the question of the governance of the agency, headed since the beginning of July by the Latvian Aija Kalnaja.
23186	19	"Anitta Hipper affirms that ""in terms of work on site with the Greek authorities, there is progress on the ground"", she also points to ""a new bill to guarantee a solid monitoring system"" for the treatment of asylum seekers. asylum in Greece."
23186	21	In seven years at the head of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri had supported the strengthening of the agency, which has been considerably beefed up and whose staff - with agents now armed - should reach 10,000 coast guards and border guards by 2,027.
23187	1	Russia. Energy sanctions backfire on Europeans
23187	3	Decline in the supply of Russian gas, increase in its cost... Germany, particularly affected, is in great difficulty. Emmanuel Macron, for his part, multiplies meetings with the leaders of the Gulf countries. He thus receives this Thursday Mohamed Ben Salmane, the Saudi crown prince, who has become popular again.
23187	5	The energy ministers of the European Union agreed on Tuesday in Brussels for their countries to reduce their gas consumption in a coordinated manner. A forceps agreement which provides that each country does “everything possible” to reduce, between August 2022 and March 2023, its gas consumption by at least 15% compared to the average of the last five years over the same period.
23187	7	In the event of a “risk of serious shortage”, an alert mechanism will make the 15% reduction “binding” for the 27, but this objective will be adapted to the realities of each State, in particular the capacities to export the quantities of gas saved. countries in need, through a series of waivers.
23187	9	The Spanish minister: “We were not even asked for our opinion”
23187	11	Russia accounted for some 40% of EU gas imports until last year and some countries, starting with Germany, depend on it more than others. Hence the rant of some European leaders.
23187	13	"The Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Teresa Ribera, explained on the eve of the Brussels meeting: ""We defend European values, but we cannot assume a disproportionate sacrifice on which we have not even been asked for our opinion. »"
23187	15	"She castigated in particular the refusal to take into account ""diverse realities in terms of energy infrastructure in each member country"". Through the derogations contained in the agreement approved on Tuesday, Spain could thus reduce its gas demand by only 7%."
23187	17	Deliveries of Russian gas via the Nord Stream gas pipeline, as announced, fell Wednesday morning to nearly 20% of its capacity. The Italian group Eni has at the same time announced that it has been informed by the Russian company Gazprom, citing a maintenance operation on a turbine, that gas deliveries would be limited to 27 million cubic meters on Wednesday, against 34 million “in recent days”.
23187	19	Emmanuel Macron multiplies meetings with the Gulf countries
23187	21	A Kremlin spokesman said on Tuesday that the reduction in speed was due to Western sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. “If there had not been these restrictions, everything would have been accomplished (…) within the usual timeframe,” he said.
23187	23	What if the sanctions that the Europeans and Americans have imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine achieved the opposite goal? If Russia exports less, the surge in prices recorded, on the other hand, fills the coffers. Germany's difficulties will have economic repercussions across the continent.
23187	25	French gas storages are 75% full, with the aim of being full in the fall.
23187	27	Faced with this situation, France wants to be reassuring. French gas storages are 75% full, with the aim of being full in the fall, said Energy Transition Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher on Wednesday.
23189	3	This Tuesday, July 19, in the morning of Europe 1, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, Minister of Energy Transition, explains that the French had to drastically reduce their energy consumption. To the journalist who asks her if we can envisage a policy of rationing, she replies with a circumlocution of barely masked cynicism: “It does not look exactly like that. In the system we have, we are talking about escalation steps towards a scenario of supply difficulties. The first step is the energy savings that we put in place. These savings are good for the wallets of companies, administrations and the French people, and they are good for the energy transition, the fight against global warming and no one any longer disputes, after these episodes of heat wave, that we are in a period of fundamental transformation of our climate. In short, deprivation and rationing, for our greater good.
23189	5	Authoritarian planning with the scent of revisited socialism: thus, it is also planned to ask certain companies to reduce their consumption, or even to stop their production for several hours a day, with financial compensation… or not. Be that as it may, the minister's embarrassed circumlocutions struggle to evade the main subject of this government call for energy restraint: Europe, and particularly France, is facing the boomerang effect of the idiotic sanctions decreed against Russia. , which still provides us with 17% of our gas.
23189	7	"The French will also have to get started, it is planned not to exceed 19°C for individual heating this winter, an ""eco-gesture"" which will be coupled with the reactivation of off-peak/peak hour tariffs... This old recipe for 1980s consists in allowing the French to benefit from lower tariffs outside peak electricity consumption hours because, she assures us, ""it has a value for getting through the winter and for our planet"". Didn't the Head of State warn us that he intended to ""also put citizens in a position to consume less"" through his energy sobriety plan?"
23189	9	But who are we kidding?
23189	11	"What was presented until yesterday as a plan by the French government to anticipate an energy crisis caused by a most hazardous diplomatic action therefore in reality comes out of the plan of the European Commission presented on July 20 in Brussels. It is called ""Saving gas for a safe winter"" and is literally tipping Europe into a war economy: ""The Commission is today proposing a new legislative instrument and a European plan to reduce gas demand, in order to to reduce gas consumption by 15% in Europe until next spring. All consumers, governments, households, owners of public buildings, electricity suppliers and industry can and should take action to save gas. »"
23189	13	"Russia supplies 40% of European gas, so it is a question of trying to anticipate, in disaster, what was largely foreseeable, namely a serious shortage this winter and a real difficulty in replenishing stocks for next year. . For this, European newspeak is in order: the Commission's press release speaks of ""thus strengthening European energy resilience""."
23189	15	"Member States are in fact being asked to reduce their gas consumption by 15% from August (in ten days), until 31 March 2023. And the Commission will not hesitate to show itself clearly more coercive in the event of a major crisis, making this objective a binding measure: ""The new regulation would also give the Commission the possibility of declaring, after consulting the Member States, a 'Union alert' on the security of supply , imposing a mandatory gas demand reduction on all Member States. »"
23189	17	So much for sobriety!
23189	19	"With regard to solidarity between Member States, the very one whose merits we are praised for, inseparable from the European Union, it will only apply under conditions: ""Member States requesting a solidarity gas supply will be required to demonstrate the measures they have taken to reduce domestic demand. “Measures checked every two months… This crisis is therefore also an opportunity to strengthen energy interdependence between Member States."
23189	21	It is also - ideology obliges - an opportunity to accelerate the ecological transition: “The plan provides guidelines that Member States must take into account when planning reductions. […] priority should be given to switching to renewable energy or cleaner, less carbon-intensive or polluting options. »
23189	23	This energy crisis into which we have rushed is now only the pretext for harshly cutting back the sovereignty of each of the member countries of the European Union. After sovereignty in health matters, largely eroded by the Covid crisis, it is today our energy sovereignty that is being severely undermined.
23191	1	The coincidence strikes back
23191	3	Last December, a previous article noted an unusual spike in minor heart problems among athletes and especially footballers in 2021: apparently, this year saw more deaths on the pitch than in past years. The proximity of these events to the distribution of magical picouses was disturbing.
23191	5	But, we were assured at the time, all of this was pure coincidence: reminding, again and again, that correlation is not causation, that everything was under control and that there was no there that observation or attribution bias, at worst could we observe quite finely that certain athletes, sick with Covid in 2020, suffered the terrible consequences ten or twelve months later on the occasion of a cardiac effort. The long covid – never clearly defined but roughly practical in this case – answered the few questions that still remained.
23191	7	Life went back to normal, dotted with natural heart attacks, the usual thromboses, the common sudden death, and perfectly legitimate disrupted periods.
23191	9	Time passes, studies accumulate and medicine progresses. Far from the media and the Patrolmen of Official Reason who remind everyone of what it would be wrong to imagine, think or deduce, some research with astonishing results has been published since. The conclusions are rather unequivocal.
23191	11	Thus, a study published in Nature (an obscure scientific pamphlet) shows a 25% increase in emergency cardiovascular events among 16-39 year olds following the first and second doses of vaccine. Amazing coincidence.
23191	13	Thus, another study seems to show a higher rate of myocarditis in men under 40 after two or three doses of vaccine, and in a higher proportion than the myocarditis observed for men in the same age group after Covid. .
23191	15	In JAMA, two doses of Pfizer are found to increase the risk of myocarditis in 12- to 15-year-olds 133-fold over baseline. Chance causes amazing things to be written.
23191	17	Apparently, covid would not be responsible for these supernumerary cardiac concerns since no evidence of an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in unvaccinated adult patients who recovered from covid-19 was observed in this study- this out of several hundred thousand Israelis. Surprising
23191	19	Finally, still in JAMA and according to a Nordic study based on the population of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, Pfizer's miracle potion would expose 16-24 year olds to a greater risk of myopericarditis than covid -19.
23191	21	Of course, one would have to be particularly crazy to imagine that what is observed in millions of Britons, Danes, Israelis or Swedes would also be true of athletes who make intensive use of their hearts. What would have been observed on the football fields would therefore remain a mystery or a simple statistical anomaly.
23191	23	It is therefore clear that coincidences are everywhere. The average observer is, of course, full of tics and very often sinks into statistical error, hazy approximation and hasty conclusions.
23191	25	"However, we see every day growing the body of elements which tend to make people think that everything would not be totally rosy in the kingdom of ""95% safe and effective"" vaccines, promoted by pharmaceutical industries never condemned for fraud and governments with impeccable honesty."
23191	27	This is how we can wonder about other coincidences, such as these people who die more at home than usual or this excess mortality both in the United Kingdom and in the rest of Europe, estimated between 5 and 15% in this part of the world, while vaccination concerns more than 80% of people there.
23191	29	"It seems clear that the confinements have done a lot of damage: suicides, less good medical follow-up, encouragement for everyone not to go to the hospital which has been overwhelmed everywhere for two years, all this contributes both to an upsurge in ""died at home"" and too late diagnoses for certain fatal diseases."
23191	31	"The fact remains that more people currently die in 2022 than in 2019, 2020 and 2021. We may wonder about the ""harvest"" effect which should normally have compensated for these harmful consequences of the policies of disastrous health over the past two years, and on the lack of any real explanation for the significant increase in the number of small coffins observed in funeral parlors and among embalmers."
23191	33	Rest assured: these random sightings are just that, collections of disparate elements that unfortunately form grounds for concern almost exclusively based on coincidence. There is no doubt that - exactly as for the heart problems of footballers - it is only a will, idiotic, fierce and obviously conspiratorial to see links there when there is nothing.
23193	3	Arcom (ex-CSA) notes that white and affluent people appear much more than those from immigration and less fortunate social categories.
23193	5	"“The Republic is one and indivisible; it must also be so in its representation on the screens. This imperative, stated by Carole Bienaimé Besse, member of Arcom (ex-CSA), serves as a chimera for television. In a little over a decade, she has made little progress and still prefers to show on the air white people belonging to wealthy social categories and living in large cities rather than those from immigrant backgrounds, from lower social classes and living in the countryside, concludes the annual report drawn up by the audiovisual regulator. This was based on 1,800 hours of programs of all genres viewed on nineteen digital terrestrial television channels in 2021. ""We can see that it remains extremely difficult for publishers to represent French society"", sorry Carole Bienaimé Besse, also a producer."
23193	7	"In 2021, the situation has even worsened for ""people perceived as 'non-white'"". Their representation rate rose in one year from 16% to 14%, in particular due to non-stop news channels, where the rate did not exceed 10%, with the exception of BFM-TV (14% ). Not content with having been significantly less represented in news programs, people of color held a negative role in 2021, in 43% of cases, a jump of 11 points in one year."
23196	3	Meeting in Madrid, NATO should include in the new Strategic Concept that Russia constitutes a direct threat to its security.
23196	5	"A ""war crime"", ""atrocities"", an attempt to ""stun"" to terrorize civilian populations, ""unprecedented brutality""... In the aftermath of the deadly Russian strike which hit a shopping center in Kremenchuk, Western leaders expressed their indignation in turn in Elmau, Germany, at the end of the G7 meeting, before going to Madrid for a NATO summit. ""Russia cannot and must not win the war,"" insisted Head of State Emmanuel Macron in Bavaria, forgetting, for a moment at least, his desire to maintain a window of dialogue with Vladimir Putin. ""We must be united in Madrid, united in support for Ukraine, united in our firmness, united in the defense and security of the eastern flank of our Alliance"", he insisted while in Germany, the seven leaders of the richest countries have decided to hit the Russian economy by ""working"" on a cap on the price of Russian oil and imposing restrictions on the import of Russian gold."
23196	7	"More than four months after the start of the conflict and while NATO is also preparing to draw the consequences, the autocrat has chosen intimidation and provocation. While Ukrainians mourned their dead, NATO member Lithuania was the target of a cyberattack in response to sanctions imposed on the Kaliningrad enclave. ""It's not the first. We have experienced many others since February 24,” commented Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Baltic counterparts on Monday."
23196	9	"""For us, Crimea is part of Russia. Which means it is forever"
23196	10	"Dmitry Medvedev, former president and close to Putin."""
23196	12	"In this context of threats, the Kremlin affirmed its determination to carry out the war until its end. The conflict will end when Ukraine has ""laid down its arms"" and implemented ""all the conditions set by Russia"", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. At the same time, Dmitry Medvedev, former president and close to Putin, was belligerent: if Crimea is attacked by a member country of NATO, ""it will be the third world war"", he warned. “For us, Crimea is part of Russia. Which means it is forever,” he said."
23196	14	In Spain, the war is far away. Torn, the ruling coalition delivers few weapons to Ukraine and devotes only one percent of its GDP to its defense, at the back of the pack. But with the NATO summit, which opened on Tuesday evening with a dinner with the King of Spain, Felipe VI, the Alliance is preparing to write down in black and white in its new Strategic Concept that Russia constitutes a direct threat to its safety. The main military nations of the Alliance should announce “an extra effort”, assures an American diplomat; “and even France”. “We are a reliable ally”, we insist at the Élysée.
23196	16	Winning the Unity Bet
23196	18	"The United States should confirm on Wednesday “new military commitments (Americans in Europe, editor’s note) on land, at sea and in the air in the long term”. For his part, Chancellor Olaf Scholz assured in an interview with the ARD that the Bundeswehr would become ""the largest conventional army"" in Europe. ""This is important for NATO's defense capability as a whole,"" he said."
23196	20	But it will not be these abilities that will fight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls again and again for weapons. It thus urges its Western partners to provide in particular anti-missile defense systems. NATO is examining ways to replace the capabilities that member states would deliver to Ukraine.
23196	21	Westerners will have to win the bet of unity. Moscow is betting on the erosion and weariness of democracies in the medium term to weaken Ukraine
23196	23	To overcome the test of firmness, Westerners will have to win the challenge of unity. Moscow, for its part, is betting on the erosion and weariness of democracies in the medium term to weaken Ukraine. The Madrid summit was in any case crowned with success on Tuesday evening: Turkey lifted its veto on a candidacy for the Alliance of Finland and Sweden, while a blockage was expected from Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
23197	3	To reduce our CO2 emissions, the government is launching operation sobriety. Air-conditioned stores that leave their front doors open will be fined, and illuminated signs will have to flicker for less time. In the 2000s, the Minister of Ecology at the time told the French not to leave their devices on standby to reduce their energy consumption. The absurdity is that at the same time luminous advertising screens appeared which emitted as much heat as an electric radiator. We scooped the spoon on one side and continued to open the floodgates on the other.
23197	5	Government measures to achieve sobriety will also affect industries. How will big companies manage to consume less without reducing their production and their payroll? From the small shopkeeper with his air conditioning to the steel mills that melt metal with electric arcs, everyone will have to get involved. Very quickly, the problem of equality in the reduction of greenhouse gases will arise. Should we impose on the middle classes the same energy savings as on the inhabitants of upscale neighborhoods? A wealthy individual probably consumes more than another, because he can afford it by buying big polluting cars or by traveling in a private jet. But the challenge is to reduce everything on the planet that, in one way or another, produces greenhouse gases. And there, no one can say that he does not produce any, that he lives in Monaco, Berry or Seine-Saint-Denis. Because energy savings are not a tax on large fortunes. You don't have to be very rich to produce pollution.
23197	7	During a report at the Achères wastewater treatment plant in the Yvelines (see Charlie n° 1257), we were told that, although the Parisian population had increased in recent years, the quantity of wastewater had remained steady. How ? Thanks to more water-efficient washing machines or toilet flushes with small tanks, to name but a few examples. Taken together, these seemingly ridiculous measures had an impact, since wastewater discharges remained stable, while the number of inhabitants continued to increase. These economic measures did not only concern wealthy neighborhoods, but the whole of Île-de-France. This demonstrated that ecological measures are not always correlated with a social approach. Everyone will have to apply them, regardless of their heritage, because imposing these restrictions on only one social category will not be enough to produce lasting effects.
23197	9	"By only considering closing the doors of stores that have air conditioning, we start with the easiest. When it is necessary to reduce types of consumption which concern all social classes, the debates will go into a spin. We will be told that it is scientifically proven that it is the rich who pollute the most, and that they alone will therefore have to save energy. In the early 1990s, we saw the appearance of climate skeptics, who claimed to demonstrate scientifically that global warming did not exist. In the same way, we will see the appearance of the ""climato-social-skeptics"", who will affirm, with supporting figures, that since the rich pollute the most individually, it is first of all they who will have to restrict their lifestyle. . After thirty years wasted in the fight against climatosceptics, we risk losing another thirty years in the fight against “climato-social-septics”."
23198	3	Not so long ago, even lip service to criticizing the Olympics earned you a place in the camp of Olympic killjoys. Global communion around the sacred flame was de rigueur, and any questioning of the high mass of sport and sponsors was considered blasphemy. But since Paris won the rusty cup of the 2024 Games, and as the fateful date approaches and the tiles accumulate, the detractors of the event are becoming ever more numerous. For some, the pleasure of crushing a little more Anne Hidalgo is undoubtedly for many. But whatever the reasons that push each other to kick back, we can only rejoice. For the record, if Paris finally obtained the “privilege” of organizing the 2024 Olympics, it is also because the other candidate cities, Toronto, Hamburg, Boston, Rome, Budapest, had in turn withdrawn. Go find out why...
23198	5	"The modern Olympics have always been less about sports and more about bribes, uninhibited doping and compromise with the worst regimes on the planet, from Nazi Germany to Xi Jinping's China, including Putin's Russia. As for the organization of the ""party"", it inevitably rhymes, for the designated cities, with pharaonic works giving birth to infrastructures as hideous as they are useless, many of which will end up abandoned, and with budgets bursting all the ceilings of the decency and generating abysmal debts over several generations. For Paris 2024, we must also add the absurd idea of ​​a “floating” opening ceremony, taking place all along the banks of the Seine, over a distance of 6 km. Which, according to all the experts, represents a real security headache. In the same way, moreover, as the management of the maintenance of order of these two weeks of Parisian Olympics. According to the estimates of the Court of Auditors, ensuring the security of the sites will require the employment of 22,000 to 33,000 agents per day, which far exceeds the staff available in French private security companies..."
23198	7	"At a time when everyone has only the word ""sobriety"" in their mouths, what is the meaning of this type of megalomaniac event which is based on excess and assumed waste? If we have any idea, the experience of previous Games helping, of the financial cost of this megabuffoonery – for the moment, it is estimated that the slate will amount to 10 or 11 billion euros, or not far from double the initial budget – not many people wonder about its ecological cost. The forests of cranes on the construction sites of the future Olympic sites and the drill convoys of the Grand Paris metro – which will not, however, be ready in time to connect the Olympic Games sites as initially planned… – give us some clues. The Olympic values ​​are also measured in tonnes of concrete poured and CO2 spit into the atmosphere. So much for the preparation."
23198	9	There remain the Olympics themselves, a big fortnight of competitions and various festivities. No need to be a climate expert to know that, now, who says Summer Games says Games under very likely heat wave. It will therefore be thousands of square meters of sites, including a package in the open air, which will have to be refreshed, misted, air-conditioned, if we do not want the hundreds of athletes who will sweat there and the millions of spectators who will pile up there and pass out and resuscitation be raised, by force of circumstance, to the rank of an Olympic discipline. In other words, the energy bill is also likely to be particularly high. Even if we turn off the stadiums at night and close the door to the air-conditioned locker rooms.
23199	1	Storming the Capitol: In the end, Trump was not funny
23199	3	Seen from Europe, Trump was as ridiculous as he was frightening. With the commission investigating the events of January 6, 2021, it is ultimately totally creepy.
23199	6	"The Democratic-led House of Representatives commission of inquiry into the events of January 6, 2021 on Capitol Hill will hold its two final hearings in July, not June. The reason ? The more the commission digs into the course of this crazy day – which began with a harangue from Donald Trump to his supporters to end with the storming, narrowly missed, of Congress – the more it discovers the implausible. Clearly, it was a hair's breadth away from the handover of power between Trump and Biden being hampered by a coup. Ease, even wanted, by an outgoing president who did not want to leave his post and sought to demonstrate that the November 2020 election had been ""stolen"" from him."
23199	8	Additional elements continue to arrive at the investigators, attesting to the extent of the pressures undergone by the Minister of Justice, William Barr, so that he “tweaks” the result of the ballot boxes. What this conservative, who has principles, had refused to do, to the point that he preferred to resign. It was the Republican vice-chairman of the commission, Liz Cheney, who announced the adjournment of the work. Not that she wants to bury them. The daughter of Dick Cheney, former vice-president of Bush junior, is on the contrary an anti-Trump who is being agonized by his camp for treachery: she would have recorded remarks by the leader of the Republicans in the House, Kevin McCarthy, bringing to Trump responsible for the assault on the Capitol by fanatical supporters. Including the neo-Nazis of the Proud Boys, who found themselves only 12 m from Vice President Mike Pence, whom they wanted to kill, on the grounds that this evangelical Christian, anti-abortion and anti-LGBT but endowed with common sense , had explained to Trump that he had lost and that they had to leave the White House…
232	3	Food poverty and energy poverty: we cannot blame environmentalists for maintaining the mystery of their intentions.
232	4	Programmatically, the most extremist environmentalist parties in Europe are the Belgian Ecolo & Groen and the German party Die grünen. These parties have in common to be in power at the federal level of their respective countries, with socialist and liberal parties.
232	5	Belgium is, along with France, one of the European countries whose energy mix emits the least CO2. This virtue is entirely due to seven perfectly operational nuclear reactors. The ace ! Ecologists, whose primary ideological engine is and has never been anything but hatred, have an inextinguishable hatred of nuclear power. On the one hand because nuclear power seems to them a kind of rape of Gaia, by extracting from it a virtually unlimited energy. On the other hand because this energy is precisely unlimited, which counteracts the generalized misery – they prefer modesty – which is now the primary objective of environmentalists in politics. Belgian environmentalists demanded and narrowly failed to obtain the replacement of the entire nuclear fleet by gas-fired power plants. This would have suddenly propelled Belgium into the class of European countries with the highest CO2 emissions. An environmental official said at the time: “It doesn’t matter, the other European countries will compensate by reducing their emissions. “Clever monkey! The invasion of Ukraine has reduced the ultra-carbonist projects of environmentalists to nothing. He has in fact realized that the gas-fired power stations fantasized by environmentalists would be supplied partly and by necessity by Russian gas, contributing directly to Russia's war efforts. Defeated by reality on the extension of nuclear power, Belgian ecologists are now nitpicking over the details: extending two nuclear reactors when it will be necessary to extend five. Indeed, the Ecolo and Groen parties are still demanding to replace three viable nuclear reactors with gas-fired power stations that will cause Belgian CO2 emissions to explode. These gas-fired power stations would still and always, out of material necessity, be supplied in part by Russian gas, thus financing Russian imperialism. What is new is that we learn that one of the power plants fantasized by ecologists would be built and therefore controlled by the totalitarian regime… Chinese. European environmentalists are decidedly — and resolutely! — the providence of humanicidal regimes. We wonder: what is the threshold of contradiction from which Ecolo voters – in Groen there are hardly any more – will wonder about the relevance, rationality and conformity to their own values, of their electoral choice?
232	6	In Germany in 2018, at the rostrum of the United Nations, President Donald J. Trump signaled to the Germans that they would aggravate their arch-dependence on Russian gas - and therefore that of Europe - by adding Nord-Stream 2 to Nord- Stream 1. The German delegation welcomed this declaration - a simple factual statement - with this characteristic air of superiority: — the closure of the last three German nuclear reactors in service. This, to replace them with gas — always more gas! 55% of German gas is paid to Russia – and coal, among all the most polluting energy source, in addition to massively emitting CO2. We read a lot that the Germans learn from their mistakes. It is permissible to doubt it.
2320	1	Fight against covid: the solutions will come from the local
2320	3	The pandemic is the best demonstration that while international organizations can provide information and advice, the fight against crises must be left to local administrations.
2320	5	National governments and supranational organizations like the WHO continue to push for more power to avert the next big crisis. But they cannot keep citizens safe from unpredictable disasters like Covid-19. The real solutions will instead come from local organizations, provided they remain flexible and prepared.
2320	7	As the World Health Organization (WHO) holds its annual assembly this week, it will argue that it needs a bigger role and more power to combat future health crises. More than anything, the organization wants more money.
2320	9	Like natural disasters, epidemics tend to surprise. They are by nature unpredictable and it is illusory to feel safe in front of them.
2320	11	As the Covid-19 pandemic raged, the WHO wanted to take the lead in the fight against the disease. But that wasn't her role, and she wasn't equipped to do it. The work of the organization is rather to offer support in terms of sharing knowledge and experience, not to define a policy.
2320	13	In the initial phase, the Chinese made it difficult for the organization to conduct on-site investigations. Yet even as Beijing erected these hurdles, the organization hailed China's success in containing the disease — likely out of political expediency — and ignored the oppressive steps it took to achieve it.
2320	15	The WHO's bias in favor of China was also visible when it rejected Taiwan's request to participate as an observer in the annual assembly which was held from May 24 to June 1, 2021. shows that politics is more important than the fight against the pandemic for the organization.
2320	16	Bureaucratic and disproportionate
2320	18	In the face of the pandemic, countries have generally panicked and implemented disproportionate responses. Bureaucracy made it difficult to find quick solutions. Politicians restricted civil liberties, and many governments passed emergency laws that gave the executive considerable leeway to limit basic freedoms. All this had only a small impact on the pandemic.
2320	20	Abundant bureaucracy and regulations stifle creativity and impede rapid decision-making. They also diminish personal responsibility. Although the pandemic is global, situations vary by country, region and city. In addition to global policies, the situation requires local solutions. Centralization necessarily increased bureaucracy, slowing down the process of disease control.
2320	22	Another problem is that years of prosperity and an oversized welfare system have blunted the notion of self-responsibility. In Europe, where socialism grew stronger, people let the state take on more and more functions, trading freedom for an illusion of security. Yet, in times of danger, personal responsibility is essential.
2320	24	People expect politicians to provide solutions. Politicians, in turn, have obediently outsourced this responsibility to selected scientific groups. An open scientific debate has been curbed in favor of a dominant opinion.
2320	26	It seems that during these years of prosperity, societies – especially the wealthier ones – lost the ability to react to threats. Scottish historian Niall Ferguson notes that three small, highly developed countries, facing intense peril, handled the situation much better than the others: Israel, Taiwan and South Korea. All three must be constantly alert. Israel has to deal with terrorism and threats from hostile nations like Iran. Taiwan is threatened by China. South Korea faces an unpredictable, brutal and aggressive regime in North Korea.
2320	27	stay local
2320	29	In Europe, countries with more decentralized health structures and systems, such as Switzerland, Germany and Austria, experienced fewer problems, especially during the first wave. Countries such as France, Italy and Spain, whose health systems are centralized and heavily influenced by public authorities, have managed the crisis less well.
2320	31	Most countries, including Germany, wanted a European solution for vaccination. They did not know that supply was never the role of Brussels. The plan was implemented anyway, and the result of this move towards centralization is now well known: chaos and disaster.
2320	33	However, it would be wrong to place most of the responsibility on the European Union. One can only reproach him for not having refused to assume this responsibility. The responsibility lies with national governments, especially large countries, who pushed Brussels to put in place a centralized plan.
23200	3	In a report, the NGO accused the Ukrainian army of establishing military bases in schools and hospitals and launching attacks from populated areas.
23200	5	"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday evening August 4 accused Amnesty International of “attempting to grant amnesty to the terrorist state” of Russia, after the NGO accused kyiv of endangering civilians in the context of the war with Moscow. . Amnesty International ""transfers the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim"", he added. Earlier in the day, the head of Ukrainian diplomacy, Dmytro Kouleba, said he was ""outraged"" by the ""unfair"" accusations of the NGO."
23200	7	"In a report released Thursday after a four-month investigation, the NGO accused the Ukrainian military of establishing military bases in schools and hospitals and launching attacks from populated areas, a tactic it said violates the international humanitarian law. ""When the Ukrainian army moved into civilian structures in residential areas, it neither asked civilians to evacuate surrounding buildings nor helped civilians to evacuate them, thus refraining from taking all possible precautions to protect the civilian population”, it is written in particular in the report. Testimonials from residents accompany this file, such as that of Mykola, who lives in the Donbass, and explains: “I don't understand why our army is shooting from the cities and not from the countryside. »"
23200	9	"""False reality"""
23200	11	“The aggression against our state is unjustified, invasive and terrorist. If someone writes a report in which the victim and the aggressor are in some way put on an equal footing, if certain data on the victim is analyzed and the actions of the aggressor are ignored, that does not can be tolerated,” Volodymyr Zelensky added in his daily video statement.
23200	13	"SEE ALSO - Ukraine denounces Amnesty's ""unfair"" report, which accuses it of endangering civilians"
23200	15	"Dmytro Kouleba for his part accused Amnesty International of ""creating a false balance between the oppressor and the victim, between the country which is destroying hundreds and thousands of civilians, cities, territories and the country which is desperately defending itself""."
23201	2	Kyiv, Ukraine - Ukraine's president, at war for more than five months, has announced that you can now remove the Ukrainian flag from your profile picture without fear of reprisal.
23201	4	"""After almost six months of war, I am announcing to the whole world that you can remove the Ukrainian flag from your profile picture, and I promise you that we will not be angry,"" Volodymyr Zelensky said this morning in a video posted on social media. ""It made us happy at first, but I understand that after a while you want to find something else to show people that you are a good person,"" added the head of state. “Thank you to citizens around the world who have supported us by changing their profile pictures, posting dance videos on TikTok, and learning a few words of Ukrainian on Duolingo before switching back to Spanish. »"
23201	6	“It was a big relief, because I had been thinking about replacing the Ukrainian flag in my profile picture for several weeks with something about the environment or something like that,” says Thomas, a Frenchman who likes to contribute. to important causes by showing their support with just a few clicks. “By removing the Ukrainian flag from my photo on LinkedIn, I will finally be able to find a job by displaying the #OpenToWork badge! »
23202	2	Galvanized by the repeal of the abortion law, Texas would now like to ban “women in general”.
23202	4	“After consideration, this is the best solution…. Who gives birth to homosexuals? The women. Who aborts? The women. Who doesn't salt my lasagna enough? My wife. said Republican Governor Greg Abott.
23202	6	As with abortion rights, the Texas government relies on its citizens to speak out against people of the female gender. I will do my duty to prevent this ignominy. These beings are totally irresponsible “confided to us Kelly, an American who fights for the prohibition of women.
23204	2	Scientists at Stanford University (United States) are developing an unprecedented sunscreen with a protection factor of 450.
23204	4	The heat wave that is suffocating France is far from being the last. In question ? Global warming and its disastrous consequences. A team of American researchers is, at this very moment, finishing the creation of a “super cream”. “Its index of 450 definitely blocks increasingly aggressive UV rays and you no longer have to constantly think about reapplying it because a single application per week is sufficient. »
23204	6	"However, in Europe and more particularly in France, the composition of this new generation cream is debated. While today, more and more brands are talking about the ""clean"" composition of their formulas that respect corals and marine species, this cream goes against this trend. It would indeed be composed of 90% crude oil: “We use it for its retro-reflective properties, the UVs bounce off this opaque material and do not penetrate the skin. says one of the scientists involved in this project."
23206	3	Quite rare in China, Internet users have openly criticized the reaction of their government, which they blame for not having banned the landing of Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan.
23206	5	It is quite unusual to see Chinese nationalists publicly criticizing their government. However, after the surprise visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, some did not go there with a dead hand. In an article published on Thursday, August 4, the New York Times reported several testimonies from Chinese people who were unhappy with the lack of direct reaction from the Chinese government when the plane of the leader of the American deputies landed in Taipei on August 3.
23206	7	"""Don't do a power show if you don't have the power,"" one user said on the Weibo network, for example. “What a humiliation,” wrote yet another. Some have compared the People's Liberation Army to the Chinese football team, considered the laughing stock of the country, having never qualified once for the World Cup. Other reactions were also more sulphurous: some members of the Communist Party said on We Chat that they would like to resign out of shame from their government and an army veteran said he no longer wanted to talk about his military experience for the same reasons. , reports the New York Times."
23206	9	"The source of their anger? China, which had promised repercussions following Pelosi's visit, would not have carried them out according to them. When the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives mentioned her visit to Taiwan, although she said ""come in peace"", China, furious, was quick to mention a potential military escalation if the visit of the speaker was maintained. A few minutes after the landing of the latter, China announced ""targeted military actions"" around the island and its desire to impose economic sanctions on its neighbor. But the absence of concrete military action on the arrival of Nancy Pelosi disappointed some Chinese nationalists. On Wednesday afternoon, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, responded by saying she believes the Chinese people are rational people and have confidence in their country and government."
23206	11	The Chinese government has taken action
23206	12	However, on Thursday August 4, China began a series of military maneuvers around Taiwan. Five missiles crashed in Japanese territorial waters, according to Tokyo. At least 11 more would have hit the waters to the north, south and then east of the island. A total of 27 People's Liberation Army aircraft infiltrated surrounding areas. Missiles reportedly flew over the Matsu Islands, a few kilometers from the Chinese coast.
23207	3	"The EU believes that 72-year-old Viktor Yanukovych, living in Russia, still plays ""a role in undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine""."
23207	5	"European Union member countries on Thursday (August 4th) imposed sanctions on former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his son Oleksandr for their alleged role in the security threat to Ukraine. Ukraine. The European Council said in a statement that the two men have been added to a list of European sanctions put in place ""in response to the unjustified Russian military aggression against Ukraine""."
23207	7	Viktor Yanukovych presided over Ukraine from February 2010 to February 2014, when he was overthrown by a popular uprising against the turn taken by his government, which had turned away from the West to get closer to Moscow. President Putin's Russia reacted to the defeat of its ally by seizing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and an enclave in the eastern region of Donbass. In February, Moscow launched an all-out offensive against Ukraine. Several member states of the European Union and NATO provide kyiv with sophisticated weapons to help it defend itself, and Brussels has adopted a series of sanctions.
23207	9	“Role in achieving territorial integrity” of Ukraine
23207	10	"The EU believes that 72-year-old Viktor Yanukovych, living in Russia, still plays ""a role in undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine"". The statement published Thursday in the EU's official journal accuses him of plotting to try to return to power in Ukraine if the Russian invasion manages to overthrow President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""According to different sources, Mr. Viktor Yanukovych was part of a special Russian operation aimed at replacing the Ukrainian president with him, during the first stages of the illegal military aggression against Ukraine,"" the newspaper said. His son was placed under sanction for the same reason and for having “carried out transactions with separatist groups in the Donbass region”."
23209	2	The Prime Minister spoke on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality.
23209	4	"The battle is not won, there are still steps to take. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced, Thursday, August 4, the appointment ""before the end of the year"" of an ""ambassador for LGBT + rights"". Attached to the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, the latter ""will carry the voice of France and will defend in particular the universal decriminalization of homosexuality and transidentity"", specified the head of government."
23209	6	"Elisabeth Borne spoke during a visit to the LGBT + center in Orléans (Loiret), on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality. The Prime Minister also announced the establishment of a fund of 3 million euros with the aim of creating ten new LGBT + centers and financing the 35 that already exist. ""We want there to be at least two centers in each region of France and at least one center in each overseas region,"" she added. This fund will be included in the Finance Act for 2023 and the amount will cover the period 2023-2026. In 2023, 1.5 million euros will be released, said Matignon."
2321	3	In the absence of the neutrality of Switzerland, goldsmith in the matter, between the West, on the one hand, and China, India and Russia, on the other hand, it is the world which could suffer the consequences and Switzerland.
2321	5	On August 6, 2014, I published an article on Swiss neutrality and the war in Ukraine. I recalled there that the neutrality of Switzerland had its origin in the defeat of Marignan (1515) from which was put an end to the policy of expansion of the Confederates.
2321	7	After a short period, between 1798 and 1815, Switzerland's neutrality was always effective, until 1989. It became increasingly relative, particularly following its accession to the UN in 2002, although two articles of the Swiss Constitution state that it must be preserved.
2321	9	Thus article 173 of the Constitution specifies that the first of the tasks and powers of the Federal Assembly is to take “the necessary measures to preserve the external security, independence and neutrality of Switzerland”.
2321	11	Thus article 185 of the Constitution specifies in its first paragraph that the Federal Council “takes measures to preserve the external security, independence and neutrality of Switzerland”.
2321	13	What Switzerland's neutrality is or is not, however, is not enshrined in the Constitution, which – regrettably – allows some to say and/or do anything about it, it is up to others to violate it outright by relativizing neutrality, by making it supposedly flexible.
2321	15	Already in 2014, at the time of the annexation of Crimea, Switzerland imposed economic sanctions against Russia, comparable to real acts of war1, following in the footsteps of the United States and the European Union.
2321	17	At the time, it was not yet a question of bringing Switzerland closer to NATO, as the head of the Defense Department Viola Amherd, representing the Centre, would like, or of joining this military organization as the President of the Liberal Radical Party Thierry Burcart.
2321	19	At the time, it was also not a question of exporting arms and ammunition to one of the belligerents in the midst of a conflict, that is to say of favoring a so-called Camp of Good against what would be the Camp of Evil.
2321	21	As an individual, a Swiss may have an opinion on the conflict, condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and/or seek its root causes, but the Swiss authorities have a constitutional and moral duty to preserve the country's neutrality. .
2321	23	Indeed, the neutrality of the original Switzerland enabled it to ensure its internal cohesion, to stay away from conflicts, to pursue exchanges with belligerents, to fulfill in the 20th century a function of European balance, to offer his good offices.
2321	25	This gradual abandonment of Switzerland's neutrality, which today translates into an effective bias of the country for one of the belligerents against another, is therefore contrary to both the security and the well-being of the inhabitants of Switzerland and the establishment of a dialogue of peace between nations.
2321	27	While, for more than two centuries, somehow, Switzerland has been able to maintain this role of mediator between nations, it would be harmful both for the inhabitants of Switzerland and for Western countries to give it up really, definitively. .
23211	3	Despite calls from Westerners and Japan, China announced on Monday the continuation of military exercises near Taiwan, again to respond to Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island claimed by Beijing.
23211	5	"The day after the departure from Taipei of Mrs Pelosi, number three American and speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chinese army had launched Thursday vast maneuvers ""real fire"" in six large areas all around Taiwan."
23211	7	"These exercises, at least in this configuration, were to end Sunday noon (04:00 GMT) according to the Chinese maritime security administration. They were intended to practice a ""blockade"" of the island, according to official Chinese media."
23211	9	But maneuvers continue.
23211	11	The People's Liberation Army ... continues to conduct practical joint exercises in the sea and air space around Taiwan, focusing on joint anti-submarine and sea assault operations, it said. Monday in a press release the Eastern Command of the Chinese army.
23211	13	"He did not specify in which areas these maneuvers take place, or whether they are ""live fire"" or not."
23211	15	The Chinese army has conducted in recent days around Taiwan the largest military exercises in its history in this area, sending fighter jets, warships, drones and firing ballistic missiles.
23211	17	"Because of their scale, they aroused criticism from the heads of diplomacy of the G7 (United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, United Kingdom), who considered that there was ""no justification to these ""aggressive"" maneuvers."
23211	19	"- ""Troublemakers"" -"
23211	21	"After China suspended a series of Sino-American discussions and cooperation, including on climate change, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the Chinese reaction as ""total disproportion""."
23211	23	Along with his Japanese and Australian counterparts, Mr. Blinken also issued a statement calling on China to stop its military exercises.
23211	25	Questioned Monday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not formally confirm the holding of new exercises but stressed that the reaction of Beijing was “legitimate, rational and legal”.
23211	27	"This is a warning to troublemakers as well as a lesson to supporters of Taiwan independence, he said during a regular press briefing, defending ""transparent and professional"" military maneuvers ."
23211	29	We call on the United States to examine its conscience and rectify its mistake as soon as possible (...) and to stop playing the Taiwan card in order to hinder (the development of) China.
23211	31	For their part, the Taiwanese armed forces announced on Monday that they will organize live ammunition military exercises this week simulating a defense of the island against a Chinese invasion.
23211	33	They will train to face landings on Tuesday and Thursday in the Pingtung region, in the far south. Several hundred soldiers and about 40 howitzers will be deployed for these exercises, according to the same source.
23211	35	According to the army, these exercises were already scheduled and are not a response to the Chinese exercises.
23211	37	- Missiles -
23211	39	"Taiwanese Prime Minister Su Tseng-chang said on Sunday that ""China's brutal use of military force is undermining regional peace and stability""."
23211	41	According to Chinese state television CCTV, ballistic missiles flew over Taiwan this week, which would be a first.
23211	43	To prove how close it had come to Taiwan's shores, the Chinese military released a photo it said it took from one of its warships over the weekend, showing a navy building Taiwanese just a few hundred meters away.
23211	45	China considers Taiwan, with a population of around 23 million, to be one of its provinces, which it has yet to successfully reunify with the rest of its territory since the end of the Chinese Civil War ( 1949).
23211	47	Opposed to any initiative giving the Taiwanese authorities international legitimacy, Beijing is against any official contact between Taiwan and other countries.
2323	3	There are so many angles from which one can view the war in Ukraine. I've done my best to cover them up to get a sense of why we're here... heading into a much larger conflict.
2323	5	Despite my deep cynicism, I am essentially an optimist. I tend to see issues that lead humanity away from any sort of final solution. And sometimes that means looking beyond the conditions of the current conflict and seeing it in the larger context of what humanity is trying to achieve.
2323	7	So remember, this is my bias. There is a solution even if things look bleak, because humanity has always recoiled from the worst of its excesses when confronted with them personally, at least for a few generations, until the memories faded.
2323	9	During World War II, the good guys, the Allies, defeated the bad guys, the Axis, but especially the Nazis. I am not one of those who subscribe to this caricature of events. I know the issues go much deeper than that.
2323	11	During the war, the propaganda of both sides reached the pinnacle of reductionism. The other side represented evil.
2323	12	Putin, meanwhile, calls Ukrainians both brothers of Russia and Nazis, exaggerating the genocide of Russians in Donbass. Whereas in the United States, we call Russians by names we would normally reserve for the ants that invade our kitchen.
2323	14	This conflict between West and East is a conflict of civilizations where each side uses words in very specific ways, which creates the opportunity for this kind of reductive propaganda. In the podcast I did with him, Joaquin Flores tried to elucidate this idea from the Russian point of view.
2323	16	He explained what Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov means by the word “neutral” when it comes to Ukraine. For Lavrov and Russia, neutral means being part of the great state of the Russian Union, making Ukraine a partner of Russia on the same level as Belarus and soon Kazakhstan.
2323	18	The United States and the rabid ants of the British secret service, who are shaping the talking points of this war, define neutrality like the Swiss: non-aligned, a buffer state. And this discrepancy in the definition is cynically used by NATO and the West who promote this idea that the Russians are not fulfilling their international obligations. This allows them to justify their help in the heroic defense of Ukraine against a hostile invader.
2323	20	And Russia is now a hostile invader. That's a fact.
2323	22	To promote this simplistic narrative is to ignore the past eight years in Ukraine as well as NATO's progress in Europe over the past 30 years.
2323	24	But therein lies the unbridgeable gulf between East and West.
2323	26	The fault for this gap lies entirely with NATO and the West, which have steadily advanced until they have reached the Russian border in the Donbass. Discussing this topic in other words is pathetic and just an excuse to express one's inherent racism and bloodlust towards Russians.
2323	28	This is what everyone who puts a Ukrainian flag on their Twitter feed does, whether they realize it or not.
2323	30	You do not support the right to self-determination of a people acting freely here. Ukraine is a crucial puppet state for an aggressive war of conquest waged by the very people who have inflicted on you two years of deprivation and humiliation due to COVID and now want to exploit you as tax cattle while you live in an impassable Orwellian Panopticon.
2323	32	Russia's list of grievances is as long as any bill passing through a congressional committee these days. But the most important were the attempts to overthrow Belarus and Kazakhstan. These two pivotal countries have been victims of failed revolutions aimed at overthrowing incumbent governments and installing NATO-controlled puppets, trying to replicate the “victory” in Ukraine in 2014.
2323	34	Not only have they failed miserably, but above all they have reinforced the objectives of Russia, which wishes to bring the former Soviet republics back into its orbit and end their flirtations with the West. The only remaining Soviet republic is Ukraine, the Baltic countries are simply strategically irrelevant.
2323	36	To discuss this war other than in these terms is to deliberately miss the point. And our neoconservatives in the State Department and the White House have resolutely conducted foreign policy in this way, displaying a level of ingenuity and idiocy that, frankly, cannot be described without resorting to sailor swear words.
2324	3	"Philippe de Villiers quotes the Socialist Minister of the Interior who goes to shake hands with illegal immigrants in the Jungle of Calais on July 1, 2001: “The identity of France is intimately linked to the history of migratory flows. We must have the lucidity to recognize it. "" Philippe de Villiers quotes Jacques Dupâquier, author of The History of the European Population, who could not stand this imposture: ""The real scandal is that the whole history of the settlement of France is presented by pseudo-scientists from in an abominably tendentious way. He denounced this allegation that our territory would have been populated by successive waves that would have completely mixed and mixed the population."
2324	5	We would therefore all be foreigners or descendants of foreigners. This myth of origins does not stand up to the conclusions of paleo-demography: “The total number of warriors who, in five centuries, entered Gaul must not have exceeded 200,000 or 300,000 men. This is a small minority compared to the millions of natives already present. Later, the Roman colonists will never be more than a small minority. In fact, the great acculturation of our country by the Romans has no demographic base, it is still the old ethnic background from the Neolithic that dominates. The invasion of the Franks, Burgundians, Goths, Vandals, will change very little the demography of Gaul. For these invaders were few in number.
2324	7	The myth of mixing does not hold any more than the myth of origins and successive migratory surges: the French of today would all come from a multitude of peoples who would have mixed.
2324	9	However, according to the conclusions of Jacques Dupâquier, the external contributions, between 650 and the 1880s, were weak: the contribution of the Arabs? None. The contribution of the Normans? Tiny. For a very long time, France was a full world, and even rather in a state of demographic overpressure.
2324	11	Our country remained a land of emigration until the crisis of the birth rate at the beginning of the 19th century.
2324	13	It was in the 19th century that the declining birth rate favored immigration: in 1851, there were only 380,000 foreigners in France. Serious demographers shrug off the myth of migratory banality. It was not until the early 1880s, with the first globalization, that things changed. In 1881, the bar of one million foreigners was crossed. Between the fall of the Second Empire and 1886, the foreign population doubled.
2324	15	This population contribution is partly due to a low French birth rate which leads employers to attract Belgian, Italian, Polish, Armenian, etc. labor.
2324	16	Immigration: We must regain control of our country
2324	18	But this foreign immigration, until 1950, was not an immigration of establishment but of work: we worked in France to build up a nest egg and, most often, we returned to live in our country of origin. In total, the contribution of foreigners to the French population increased from 2 million in 1914 to 4 million in 1950. There is, between this immigration and that of today, an essential difference: at the beginning of the 20th century, all the foreign population of France was of European origin. And yet, it is not without friction. Throughout the Third Republic, the debate raged on the question of assimilation.
2324	20	France itself is questioning its roots!
2324	22	"In 1897, Maurice Barrès published Les Déracinés where he recounted the misfortunes of young people cut off from their roots. Father Lemire, one of the founders of Christian democracy, affirms that it is not good for a nation to be entirely made up of uprooted people. During a session on the new law on the acquisition of nationality, on March 16, 1889, the deputy Maxime Lecomte declared from the podium: ""The real national danger consists in keeping in our country men who are not attached to any country, who don't like France..."
2324	24	“We must avoid allowing different nations to form within the French nation. »
2324	26	It was recently, with family reunification in the 1970s, that the numbers exploded. The newcomers come from everywhere, from the Maghreb, Africa, the Orient, Asia. We are moving from labor migration to settlement migration. Migrants have resolved to transport themselves as peoples with their civilization. “We include you as you are. And if you are a people, you are received as a people. »
2324	28	Politicians who deplore this development would be wrong to complain about it: a few days after the attacks of November 13, it was recommended to all those who are accustomed to go down to a public place to leave a free speech, that is to say to say critically, to kindly keep quiet. When censorship is no longer enough, in a civilized society like ours, we are invited to practice self-censorship.
2324	30	To the criminal intimidation on Islamophobia, is added, by a gesture of oblative civic-mindedness, self-control. Let everyone exercise restraint and learn to be silent. We are at war. His public speaking should be censored.
2324	32	For years, the media pillory has been enough to calm insolence. Any word that crosses the line exposes its author to the infamous accusation of xenophobia. Wanting to describe reality smashes against the wall of moral and ideological prohibitions: “Immigration is an opportunity for France“. And it continues :
2324	34	"""There are no more foreigners today than in the 1930s"", ""Islam is a religion of peace"", ""terrorists have nothing to do with Islam"". Wanting to talk about the Islamization of France, one is then accused of Islamophobia, therefore of racism. Suspicion brings us back “to the darkest hours of our history“."
2324	36	Lies are everywhere: “France has always been a country of immigration. So there is no need to worry. Those who speak of mass immigration are known to be xenophobic. They are rancid French people.
2325	3	“The United States will host the Democracy Summit to be held online on December 9-10, 2021, authorizing itself to define who should attend the event and who should not, who is a democratic country and who is not…it will only fuel the ideological confrontation and deepen the divide in the world, creating new dividing lines”: This is what the ambassadors of Russia and China write (jointly) in post in Washington.
2325	5	"""China and Russia strongly reject this initiative [...] [they] call on countries: to stop using values-based diplomacy to cause division and confrontation"", warn the ambassadors."
2325	7	Yet that is clearly Biden's intention (strategic polarization). The Biden team aims to build a pro-American strategic bloc to gain buy-in from more states and thereby isolate Russia and China. We are witnessing the instrumentalization of Taiwan against China (which, to the fury of Beijing, is now among the guests at the conference), and that of Ukraine against Russia. These two files are explosive. But of the two, Ukraine is the most sensitive.
2325	9	We should not forget, however, that America became close to General Chiang Kai-shek as early as 1925. (During World War II, there were about a thousand American military advisers in Chiang's army). And after the war, the United States handed Taiwan over to the Kuomintang (Chiang's political movement), to serve as a platform to foment an insurrection against the communist danger in mainland China.
2325	11	Of course, the United States finally had to face reality and it was not until 1971 that the United States stopped recognizing the Kuomintang of Taiwan (whose one-party dictatorship only ended ' in 1988) as the legal representative of all of China and replaced it with the CCP.
2325	13	However, with China's meteoric rise causing concern in Washington (Chimerica's story was losing credibility [During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, this American television series follows the story of a young American photojournalist who will capture the young Chinese dissident standing in front of a tank, blocking his way]) President Obama launched the pivot to Asia , the United States of America is ready for anything: Obama in front of the Australian parliament, NdT], Taiwan then became the world's fifth recipient of American weapons. The Biden team now wants to go one step further than Obama: by adding a diplomatic component to the growing number of weapons. So the wheel of time turns, and politics reverses – and it’s Don’t Let Taiwan Down again, as the CCP is once again demonized.
2325	15	And the EU agrees with that! In fact, they're the cheerleaders for Don't Let Taiwan Down (though Merkel does express some reservations). The EU is showing strategic incoherence by playing the game of the United States against China. President Xi issued a clear warning: This is playing with fire. Why would Europe want to take part?
2325	17	The tactic here is not for the US to go to war with China, but to push Taiwan's secessionist ambitions to a point that will cause Xi to lose face (an unforgivable weakness in China), and the CCP to be Split. At least that is the thrust of the anonymous Longer Telegram written by a senior US official, who argues that US policy should be to exacerbate divisions within the Party leadership. It won't work, but in the process, Europe's relationship with China will be ruined. [The longer telegram about China purposely has the same name as the historical one George Kennan wrote in 1946 on Soviet grand strategy, NdT]
2325	19	Ukraine is the most pressing issue right now, because it is descending into cascading systemic instability: Corrupt, oligarchic and dysfunctional. Economically bankrupt: Ukraine is unlikely to replace the energy (gas and coal) it lost in its bitter confrontation with Russia; and no less than half of his army (100,000 men) was holed up in muddy trenches, dug along a 250 km line of contact, reminiscent of the conditions of the First World War.
2325	21	The rumble of artillery and the crackle of small-arms fire are continuous. This is a war against the Donbass militias, entrenched a few hundred meters away – a war, and the Ukrainian soldiers openly admit it – that cannot be won without outside help. President Zelensky says the slide towards war is unstoppable unless outside help intervenes (dialogue with Putin).
2326	3	The head of diplomacy of the Grand Duchy seems to me to be quite a light in his field.
2326	5	While the hopes of the whole planet are to obtain an immediate ceasefire, followed by a treaty which guarantees the security of all parties in Europe, Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourgish Talleyrand, has the radical solution: physically liquidate Cheese fries !
2326	7	"""The physical elimination of Vladimir Putin, as probably the only solution to end the conflict"""
2326	9	I have always believed that diplomacy is the art of negotiations between governments, but I see that quick fixes still have some followers within the EU.
2326	11	For our former ambassador François Bujon de l'Estang, diplomacy is based on four pillars:
2326	13	Observe, negotiate, represent, sell. Asselborn adds a fifth: to liquidate.
2326	15	Simple question to our diplomatic executor: how does he intend to do it?
2326	17	Send its armored divisions to Moscow to tickle the Russian bear?
2326	19	It is in extreme situations that we measure the level of our ruling elites.
2326	21	Between those who want to starve the Russian people, those who want to banish Russia from humanity, those who fan the embers while remaining well hidden, those who want to integrate Ukraine into the EU and those who want to liquidate Putin , Westerners have a fine line-up of madmen.
2326	23	All these charlots juggle without knowing it with bottles of nitroglycerin.
2326	25	But it's Putin who is called crazy!
2326	27	Do not take the Russian President for a retard and an amateur surprised by events. There is no blitzkrieg when you want to preserve civilian lives. I read enormities from the “specialists” in strategy.
2326	29	It is those who have been cheated in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, who allow themselves to judge the Russian army ineffective, raving about the Ukrainian resistance. Are they hoping for a stalemate?
2326	31	If Zelensky does not persist unnecessarily, everything can stop.
2326	33	No one wants a long and bloody war like in Chechnya.
2329	3	A new attempt is made by Western mercenaries to continue fueling the fight in Ukraine under the guise of “humanitarian aid”. Former Western soldiers and mercenaries are at the head of these operations.
2329	5	A British mercenary with alleged ties to US intelligence is working to establish a version of the pseudo-humanitarian White Helmets in Ukraine.
2329	7	Macer Gifford, who previously fought in the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian Military Council, is launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund supplies he says are destined for the frontline.
2329	9	“On February 27, President Zelensky issued an official appeal for international volunteers from all over the world to help his country. The people of Ukraine need our support and they need it NOW,” its appeal page states.
2329	11	Gifford is aiming to raise at least £15,000 which he says will enable him to 'create a rapid response medical team, made up of international volunteers, which will be deployed to the frontline over the next month' .
2329	13	He plans to draw inspiration from his experience in northern Syria where, in addition to fighting the Islamic State, he set up a medical team and provided training for mercenary forces and the local population. But it is clear that this will not simply be a humanitarian mission.
2329	15	"""The terrain, the special needs of the Ukrainian army and the enemy we are going to fight means that we will have to bring the best possible equipment with us,"" he wrote, indicating that he is recruiting people to take part in the fight against Russia."
2329	17	"His own Twitter page appears to be along the same lines, posting messages on how to enlist in the Ukrainian Armed Forces after Zelensky appealed for international help. He made similar calls during a BBC radio debate with one of Britain's Stop the War coalition leaders, John Rees, who called the call for volunteers for the fight ""ridiculous"" and of dangerous."
2329	19	"Gifford's organization aims to join the fight against Russia under the guise of humanitarian intervention, a model that has been used before: ""I want to be absolutely clear here, the ambition is to create a Ukrainian version of the White Helmets,” says Gifford, a reference to the notorious group operating in Syria."
2329	21	Also known as the Syrian Civil Defense Force, the White Helmets pose as a humanitarian organization but are linked to both jihadist groups and Western military and intelligence services. Created by former British Army officer James Le Mesurier, it has received millions of dollars in funding from the US, UK and other Western governments, and serves as a cover for regime change operations.
2329	23	Predictably, criticism of the White Helmets is being dismissed as propaganda and slander carried out by the Syrian and Russian governments. But the White Helmets operate in jihadist-held areas and their buildings are located next to Islamist headquarters in many Syrian cities.
2329	25	The group has been embroiled in a series of controversies and some of its members have been shown to be supporters of al-Qaeda and other Salafist organisations. He has been accused of staging chemical attacks, including in Douma, to pave the way for Western military intervention in Syria.
2329	27	Fears that a White Helmets-style operation could be deployed in Ukraine for similar purposes have long been underscored by critics. Gifford – real name Harry – hails from an affluent area of ​​rural Cambridgeshire. Prior to his military adventurism, he served as a conservative alderman and city currency trader.
2329	29	He openly bragged about having met with US and UK intelligence and briefed government officials on the situation in Syria, pleading for increased military support. Through his connections, he tried to gain support for the YPG and participated in meetings with financiers in Switzerland, the FBI in New York and in the British Parliament.
233	1	Instead of happy globalization, the extension of scarcity
233	3	"It was beautiful, it was good, it was big, it was generous. Above all, it was going to settle everything: globalization was going to bring us peace, happiness, happy migration and force-feeding at all hours. Reality explodes in our face: in fact of happy globalization, we discover energy enslavement, economic downgrading, immigration of settlement and the extension of the domain of scarcity. Never mind, our Euroglobalist research heads only see salvation in headlong rush. Thus the rumor goes about a project to extend Europe from 27 to… 37! Is it already a cacophony? It doesn't matter, the more the merrier. The prospect is however serious since Jean-Louis Bourlanges, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, explained, this Monday morning, on Europe 1, that this risked however posing structural problems because ""we do not work at twenty-eight or twenty-seven as we functioned at six or at nine or at twelve, and we will not function at thirty-seven (sic) as we function today at twenty-seven”. Of course, it is implied that this frenzied enlargement towards the East is another form of support for Ukraine which, quickly done well, would then join Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania… with no doubt, as a bonus, some merry Caucasian mafias. And what does it matter if Ukraine's non-membership of the European Union and its entry into NATO constitute the pivot of the peace negotiations with Russia. And too bad if, as a result, the world runs at full speed towards a dramatic shortage of gas, oil and basic foodstuffs."
233	4	"Why ? Because Europe is not sovereign. She does and goes where the United States tells her to go and do. The shortage is setting in and absorbing ten more states into the European Union will obviously not change anything. Prices are soaring and the shelves are empty: no more oil, pasta soon at the price of caviar... Example of the absurdity of time with mustard which will no longer come to our noses: while the French still believed that mustard is a French product, we suddenly discover that the seeds come to us primarily from Canada and Russia. Drought here, sanctions there: end of mustard! As for sunflower oil, it is now called the ""new yellow gold"", so rare is it. Prices this spring have risen on average by 7 to 8%. If the shelves are empty, it is because the French are stocking up, says Michel-Édouard Leclerc, boss of the stores of the same name: ""In France, today, there is no shortage for everyday consumption. and there won't be any until the summer, ”he said on BFM TV, a month ago (3/4/2022). As for pasta, ""there is some"", he says, but for how long, knowing that ""for sunflower oil, our stocks go until June""? And the meat? Ukraine provides 30-40% of the European market for some maize, so feed for livestock will increase and lead to a production cost for meat. And the wheat? If the crisis continues in the East - which is more than likely - we will experience a global crisis, particularly dramatic around the Mediterranean, in the Maghreb and in Egypt. We will hold out until the summer, said Michel-Édouard Leclerc, a month ago. But summer is tomorrow! And after ? Afterwards, you will also have to cut back on energy and prepare to shiver. We have abdicated on all levels, entrusted to others the complete management of our lives. We are now at the foot of the wall."
2330	1	Russian lawmaker announces Poland next on list for 'denazification'
2330	3	"A Russian lawmaker has issued a fiery warning to Warsaw that it will be the next city to be ""denazified"". This after the Polish Prime Minister called the Russian imperialist ideology “Russkiy mir” (Russian World) a “cancer” that is eating Russian society and posing a “deadly threat” to other countries."
2330	5	Oleg Morozov, chairman of Russia's State Duma Control Committee, wrote on Telegram that the Polish leader's comments made Poland the next target for Russian attack.
2330	7	In his remarks, Mr. Morozov resorted to Kremlin rhetoric explaining its “special military operation” in Ukraine as so-called “denazification” – the pretext Moscow has used to vilify “enemies” in the context of its geopolitical strategy and justify the war.
2330	9	"""With its statements about Russia as a 'cancerous tumor' and about the 'compensation' we have to pay to Ukraine, Poland encourages us to put it in the front line for denazification after Ukraine,"" said writes Mr. Morozov."
2330	11	Morozov's remarks followed statements by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Polish President Andrzej Duda, both of whom strongly criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
2330	13	"Andrzej Duda said Russia should be forced to pay compensation to Ukraine for war damage, while Mateusz Morawiecki claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""more dangerous"" than Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin because it has nuclear weapons and a huge propaganda machine."
2330	15	"Mr Morawiecki wrote in a column in the British newspaper The Telegraph that ""the cursed specters of the 20th century have risen against Ukraine again"", alleging that the invasion of Ukraine - a country neighboring Poland which, in 1939, was itself invaded and shared by Hitler and Stalin – bears the marks of Hitlerian Nazism and Stalinist Communism, that this invasion “has already opened the doors of genocide” and is inspired by “Russkiy mir”, the ""new monstrous ideology""."
2330	17	"He clarified that in the name of this ideology, Putin and his military entourage ordered the Russian armed forces to launch the war, ""convinced them of their superiority and encouraged them to commit inhuman war crimes - murder, rape and torture of innocent civilians”."
2330	19	"""Putin's 'Russkiy mir' ideology is the equivalent of 20th century Communism and Nazism,"" Morawiecki wrote, calling it ""a cancer that not only eats up the majority of Russian society, but also constitutes a deadly threat to the whole of Europe”."
2330	21	It is not enough to help Ukraine repel Russian aggression, he argued, but “we must eradicate this monstrous new ideology entirely.”
2330	23	"""Just as Germany was once subjected to denazification, so 'deputinization' today represents the only chance for Russia and the civilized world. If we do not immediately commit to this task, we will not only lose Ukraine, we will lose our soul, our freedom and our sovereignty. »"
2330	25	"The Polish leader also stressed that, if not opposed, Russia will not stop at kyiv, but will continue its ""long march to the West""."
2330	27	"The Kremlin has denied plans to invade other countries. Vladimir Putin has claimed that what he describes as a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is a response to attempts by Western powers to establish a bulwark in Ukraine that would threaten Moscow's security."
2330	29	In particular, Mr Putin has long insisted that NATO is trying to expand its borders to put pressure on Russia militarily. This argument has been rejected as baseless by NATO – an alliance created for defensive purposes and providing for a collective response to an attack on one of its members (Ukraine is not one of them).
2330	31	"Another of the Kremlin's main justifications for its ""operation"" in Ukraine has been the allegation that the Russian-speaking population of the part of Donbass controlled by pro-Russian separatists was subject to repression by Kiev and what Mr Putin has called “genocide”."
2332	3	The heads of diplomacy and defense of the United States are expected Sunday in kyiv, the day of Orthodox Easter, the first American visit to Ukraine after exactly two months of a war which is still raging in the east and the south.
2332	5	Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Minister Llyod Austin are due to arrive in kyiv on Sunday to discuss US arms shipments to Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Saturday.
2332	7	“Heavier and more powerful”
2332	9	"The president would like them ""even heavier and more powerful"" against the Russian army, he said at a press conference at a metro station in downtown kyiv."
2332	11	Poland has already supplied 1.6 billion dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine, said its Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
2332	13	And NATO countries are starting to supply kyiv with S300 missile launchers for its air defenses. But kyiv will also need other sophisticated weapons, including Howitzer howitzers, experts say.
2332	15	France: Milan anti-tank missiles and Caesar guns
2332	17	France has also announced that it will deliver Milan anti-tank missiles and Caesar guns. Ukrainian soldiers will be trained in France in their handling from Saturday.
2332	19	Calls for a truce for the Easter weekend of Orthodox Christians had multiplied in recent days, without succeeding in reducing the fighting which continued.
2332	21	In Athens, Greece, where more than 22,000 Ukrainians have taken refuge since the start of the war, priority was given to religious festivities on Sunday.
2332	23	"""No one, not Putin, not any other dictator, not the devil, has the right to take away the joy of celebrating Easter together,"" preached the young Ukrainian priest Roman Skripnyuk to a hundred Ukrainians of the Orthodox faith. The ceremony took place in the Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity in the Athens neighborhood of Aghios Nikolaos."
2332	25	Athens: the same Orthodox traditions
2332	27	This country shares the same Orthodox traditions, and for the Ukrainians present this ceremony recalls the warm environment of the pre-war festivities. But some faces looked dark and scarred.
2332	29	"""We are sad because we are not at home with our loved ones, as we usually would be for Easter,"" noted Maria Chuprina, 30, who arrived from Izmail in the Odessa region with her husband Oleksi and their children, Maxim and Milana."
2332	31	In eastern and southern Ukraine, largely occupied by Russian forces, heavy fighting continues.
2332	33	“They literally bomb everything, all the time, H24”
2332	35	On Saturday morning, the Russian army said it had carried out 1,098 strikes with artillery and rockets in the past 24 hours.
2332	37	“They literally bomb everything (…) all the time, H24”, wrote on his Telegram channel the governor of the Lugansk region (east), Serguiï Gaidai, calling on the population to evacuate. He then announced two deaths in Zolote after Russian artillery fire.
2332	39	And in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine, six civilians were killed in Russian strikes near the village of Girské.
2332	41	"According to Volodymyr Zelensky, ""seven missiles targeted Odessa"" on Saturday, including one that ""hit an apartment building"" and ""two that were shot down"" by Ukraine's air defense system."
2332	43	At least eight people were killed in Russian strikes on the southern port city, according to a report provided by the Ukrainian presidency.
2332	45	A logistics terminal at the military airfield near Odessa targeted
2332	47	"The Russian army, for its part, claimed to have targeted with ""high precision missiles"" a logistics terminal at the military airfield near Odessa housing weapons delivered to Ukrainian forces by the United States and European countries."
2332	49	At the same time, peace negotiations remain at an embryonic stage, especially since Russia seems, for the moment, not to have achieved its military objectives.
2332	51	"Volodymyr Zelensky still called again to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ""to end the war""."
2332	53	Regarding the fate of Ukrainian fighters entrenched for several weeks in the Azovstal metallurgical complex in Mariupol, a strategic port almost wiped off the map after the Russian offensive, Mr. Zelensky warned that kyiv would abandon negotiations with Moscow if they were killed by the army. Russian army.
2332	55	Take out “those people who find themselves in a horrible situation, surrounded”
2332	57	"He also said he was ""ready"" for ""an exchange of our soldiers who defend Mariupol"", in ""any format"", to get out ""those people who are in a horrible situation, surrounded""."
2332	59	On Monday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will travel to Turkey, an important mediator in the conflict in Ukraine, before traveling to Moscow and kyiv, the organization said on Sunday.
2332	61	"A timeline denounced by the Ukrainian president who criticized Mr Guterres' decision to go first to Moscow and only then to kyiv, saying there was ""no justice and no logic in this order""."
2332	63	“The war is in Ukraine, there are no corpses in the streets of Moscow. It would make sense to go to Ukraine first, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation,” Zelensky said.
2332	65	Summit attempt MM. Zelensky and Putin
2332	67	"The UN also listed, on Friday, a series of actions by the Russian military ""may amount to war crimes""."
2332	69	Ankara is currently trying to organize a summit in Istanbul between MM. Zelensky and Putin, although Turkish officials admit that the prospects for such talks currently remain dim.
2332	71	"Russian troops, which withdrew from the kyiv region and northern Ukraine at the end of March, seek to ""establish full control over Donbass and southern Ukraine"", a senior Russian military official said."
2333	3	The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, declared that “we have entered a new page in the history of Europe, a new page in world geopolitics, even”. He also indicated that the EU, the United States and NATO had made a false step by letting Ukraine believe that it could integrate NATO.
2333	5	"Moreover, this promise also concerns Georgia. Josep Borrell admits the mistakes of EU and Western diplomacy, mistakes that led to this war in Ukraine. However, he laughs when the French journalist asks him how to deliver the weapons to Ukraine when ""people from the EU do not want to enter Ukrainian territory""?"
2333	7	"In an interview with TF1, the head of European diplomacy gave his expertise on the situation in Ukraine. He raised the subject of the war in Ukraine and the actions of the EU at the opening of the Council of the European Union in Versailles. First of all, he denounced ""a completely unjustified and gratuitous war which is becoming more and more brutal and completely unacceptable for the civilized world"", but at the end of his interview the head of European diplomacy admits the errors of the western diplomacy. Yet even though Josep Borrell acknowledges these mistakes that led to the war, he has continued to talk about his commitment to donating weapons to Ukraine, including heavy weapons, such as anti-tank guns and ""rockets"", persisting, thus, in war and in humanitarian catastrophe."
2333	8	“The EU lists Ukraine's military needs. It is Ukraine asking us what [what] it needs. And, we ask member states who can provide,” he said. “I pay. I participate in the effort to arm Ukraine from a financial point of view. The fundamental thing is ammunition and fuel”, “the tanks have to be able to roll. We also need heavy equipment, shells, cannons, especially anti-tank rockets, ”he says.
2333	10	"The EU becomes co-belligerent? To the question of the journalist - ""how to carry out the deliveries?"" - who imagines that people from the EU do not want to return to Ukrainian territory, Josep Borrell replies with a laugh, ""I'm not going to tell you that"". The journalist pointed out to him that “Hungary, for example, has banned the passage through its territory [of weapons and ammunition] and he asks Josep Borrell, aren't we becoming co-belligerent? “We are not at war with Russia. Neither from a financial point of view, nor from a military point of view"", affirms Josep Borrell to the journalist of TF1 who does not fail to seize the pole to point out to him a total inconsistency concerning his affirmation: ""That is what have said. But, when we are delivering anti-tank weapons, ammunition, weapons to kill, yes, we are at war. Josep Borrell, not bending back, continues on his argument that the EU is not at war with Russia: ""No, we are not at war"", ""we do not want to be at war"", "" we cannot afford to be at war”."
2333	12	"Even if Josep Borrell declares that he does not think ""that the end of the war will not come from an uprising of the Russian population"", he evokes the technique of ""regime change"" but denying that he wants to use this tool: ""We, we don't is not in the regime change”, because, according to Josep Borrell, “the goal is not to change the Russian political regime”. “The goal is to stop the war. To stop the war, put pressure on Putin.”"
2334	3	A few days ago, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) updated its monkeypox page to change the content on a few key points.
2334	4	"First, they removed a paragraph from the ""How do you get monkey pox?"" section. Until a few days ago, according to archived links, the Monkeypox page said this, regarding transmission to no one: “It is very rare to get monkeypox from someone who has the infection because it is not easily transmitted from person to person.”"
2334	5	…this has been completely removed.
2334	7	Second, they removed this paragraph, which was present until at least November 2021 (and possibly much more recently, there are no archives between November and May):
2334	8	“[Monkey pox] is usually a mild illness that gets better on its own without treatment. Some people can develop more severe symptoms, which is why monkeypox patients in the UK are treated in specialist hospitals. »
2334	10	The new “treatment” paragraph reads as follows…
2334	11	“The treatment of monkeypox is aimed at relieving the symptoms. The illness is usually mild and most people recover in 2-4 weeks […] You may need to stay in a specialist hospital, so that your symptoms can be treated and to prevent the infection from spreading to other people
2334	13	They therefore remove the idea that the disease will “get better on its own” and again reinforce the idea of ​​the disease spreading, although this was described as “very rare” not later. than last week.
2334	14	They even add a line about self-isolation, which has never been mentioned before:
2334	15	“…as monkeypox can be spread through close contact, you will need to be isolated if you are diagnosed with the disease. »
2335	3	"Volodymyr Zelensky called to meet Vladimir Putin to ""end the war"". The Ukrainian president reiterated his position that any discussion will become impossible if his soldiers entrenched in Mariupol are killed. “I think whoever started this war will be able to end it,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference on April 23 inside a metro station in downtown kyiv. maintaining that “he was not afraid to meet” Vladimir Putin if that made it possible to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine."
2335	5	"""I insisted from the start on negotiations with the Russian president,"" he said. And to add: ""It's not that I want [to meet], it's that I have to meet him in order to settle this conflict through diplomatic means."" ""We trust our partners, but there is no trust with Russia,"" he said. The Ukrainian president also declared, as he had done in the past, that kyiv would abandon negotiations with Moscow if the Ukrainian military entrenched in the vast Azovstal metallurgical complex in Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine were killed by the Russian army. ""If our men are killed in Mariupol and if pseudo-referendums are organized in the Kherson region [south of the country], then Ukraine will withdraw from any negotiation process,"" he said. He also said he was ready for an exchange of Ukrainian soldiers who are entrenched in Mariupol. Vladimir Putin for his part presented on April 22 the reassessed objectives of the Russian offensive in Ukraine while the armed forces of his country surround the Mariupol factory. The Russian Head of State thus discussed with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the measures that the Russian forces would take in order to protect the civilian population: the opening of humanitarian corridors and ""the announcement of a ceasefire to safely evacuate civilians from the war zone,” according to the Kremlin statement. Mariupol under Russian control On April 21, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu informed President Vladimir Putin that the forces of the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of Donetsk (recognized by Moscow) controlled all of Mariupol, with the exception of the Azovstal industrial site. In early April, Russia estimated that ""many foreign mercenaries"" were present in the city. After the “liberation” of Mariupol by the Russian forces, the Russian president suspended the assault on the industrial site of Azovstal on April 23, for humanitarian reasons, he advanced to Charles Michel. The latter asked the Russian president during their telephone conversation to guarantee humanitarian corridors in the city on the occasion of the Orthodox Easter. As a reminder, on February 24 Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine, denounced by kyiv and the West in particular as a war of invasion. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, this operation aims to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine and to bring relief to the self-proclaimed Republics of Donbass (recognized by Moscow), whose populations would be threatened with ""genocide""."
2336	1	WEF wants children to learn in the metaverse to fight climate change
2336	3	"""Disconnecting"" children from the physical world and ""plugging"" them into a virtual world is the way forward when it comes to the future of education, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)."
2336	5	"It's one of the ""gems"" that came out of this year's gathering in Davos. A post published on the WEF website argues that this direction is necessary, among other things, to fight climate change – rather, it is the pressure exerted in this direction that will push for the digitalization of education. Other reasons would be to improve the quality, accessibility and affordability of education."
2336	7	"Children, who today are too ""dependent"" on learning tools such as textbooks, notebooks and pencils, should in the future be immersed in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality ( AR) and mixed reality, writes Dr. Ali Saeed Bin Harmal Al Dhaheri."
2336	9	The pandemic is cited as a good example of how digital tools can be used for online teaching, but, according to the author, they are not enough, as students saw themselves simply transferring knowledge instead of have a hands-on, “in-person” experience.
2336	11	The post laments that while technological advancements are widely used to transform the government and service sectors, it is currently not enough to disrupt education.
2336	13	“Infiltrating these advancements into education systems has become a growing imperative,” says Al Dhaheri, who believes VR will be a crucial part of future “experiential learning” that allows students to see, hear, touch and act in a virtual world.
2336	15	"VR and the metaverse combined will be the place where students and teachers will be immersed in communication and sharing, ""transcending the limits of space and time""."
2336	17	"The report only mentions the risks and concerns about alienating children from human interaction in the educational process and increasing their isolation, acknowledging that VR does “somewhat” of this, but only if it is not properly controlled, and if its introduction lacks a ""guided system""."
2336	19	Nevertheless, Al Dhaheri believes that the benefits here outweigh the risk and that students will find the virtual environment more engaging while developing “much stronger skills. »
2337	3	Turkey refuses the membership of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because of the support of these two countries to the PKK or Kurdistan Workers' Party, a terrorist organization in Turkey. President Teyep Reçep Erdogan went so far as to announce that it was useless for delegations from these two countries to come to Turkey to negotiate this refusal.
2337	5	In reality, the Turkish leadership has set a bar in an almost unstoppable game. During the war in Syria, Turkey squarely exercised direct migration blackmail on its European allies and obtained immense benefit from it, both internally, by publicly scorning European partners who did not want a Turkey in the European Union, but especially externally by obtaining more than 5 billion USD annually by setting itself up as the guardian of the gates of migratory flows from the Middle East and Asia to Europe.
2337	7	Building on his previous successes, Erdogan is doing it again with his sights set on obtaining more advantage, but this time including the great US ally. This posture seems to have annoyed Washington to the point that the Americans attempted a gamble coupled with an information offensive. The CNN channel even hinted that Turkey could be excluded from NATO. Imperturbable, Erdogan knows very well that without Turkey, NATO will end up like the defunct Warsaw Pact. It is therefore a bluff aimed at lowering the bar of Turkish demands. However, these are not modest. In exchange for a Turkish green light for Finland and Sweden to join NATO, Turkey demands:
2337	9	1- Reactivate the Lokhheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II combat aircraft delivery contract with technology transfer and on-site production;
2337	11	2- Authorization to import Russian S-400 Triumf (SA21 Growler) air defense systems while being excluded from the US sanctions regime;
2337	13	3- Immediate lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Turkey by Sweden;
2337	15	4- Condemnation by Finland and Sweden of “Kurdish terrorism” and an end to the support and facilities enjoyed by the PKK in these two Nordic countries;
2337	17	5- Various financial compensations defined by the Turkish side without possibilities of negotiation.
2337	19	"The US State Department did not appreciate that Turkey exploited this opportunity to ""put a gun to the head"" of its allies in a very difficult context in order to advance its own interests, but Erdogan is sure of his shot and knows that by setting the bar very high, he will have the bare minimum so that he can make lasting profits. Whatever the geostrategic configuration, Finland and Sweden are no match for Turkey, even for the rearmament of the Baltic and the Arctic Circle against Russia."
2339	3	"The American president does not mince his words, facing the Russian leader. Joe Biden traveled to Warsaw, Poland on Saturday March 26 to deliver a speech and meet with Ukrainian refugees. During his trip, he called Vladimir Putin a ""butcher"" and a ""dictator"". He did not stop at these two words and took the opportunity to affirm that the Russian president should ""not stay in power"". He also states that “Russia will never win in Ukraine. We will have a bright future, based on democracy, hope and light, probity and freedom. The American president can afford to use a martial tone, because he knows that his country is in no danger. The United States is sovereign in every way: economic, political and military. Joe Biden, with his shocking statements, puts himself back at the center of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict."
2339	5	"But now, the risky words of the American president have consequences in Europe - the continent on which the armed conflict is taking place. They disrupt the strategy of Europeans who maintain dialogue with Vladimir Putin at all costs. As Anthony Bellanger points out, on BFM TV, ""the Europeans have Vladimir Poutine as a neighbour"", which implies that we have no choice but to dialogue, at the risk of accentuating tensions between Western countries. and Russia. Because, unlike the country of Uncle Sam, Europe is not self-sufficient in energy. It must take into account its dependence on Russian gas. A will shaken by the 46th President of the United States."
2339	7	"However, this is not the first time that the terms used by Joe Biden have caused a reaction since the invasion of Ukraine. Two weeks ago, the head of the first world power called his counterpart a ""war criminal""."
234	3	"The European Commission was due to present, on Wednesday April 27, a draft directive aimed at facilitating the arrival of ""skills and talents"" in Europe. In short, to promote legal migration of workers and young people to meet the demographic challenge and make up for the lack of labor in sectors such as health, technology, construction or transport."
234	5	The European executive also wanted to wait for the outcome of the French presidential election so as not to run the risk of these issues being exploited by the far right. Finally, the finding, firmly supported by the employers' federations, that several Member States are suffering from a labor shortage that could hamper recovery policies has been another incentive for the European executive.
234	7	The Commission, which claims to want to present “an ambitious and sustainable plan”, specifies however that no member country will be forced to apply it. No question of a new “political suicide”, observes a diplomat, referring to the project of compulsory quotas of refugees to be welcomed that the college, directed at the time by Jean-Claude Juncker, had mentioned. It had led to a serious crisis and created a break between the founding States and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This time, it is a question of respecting the competence of the Member States, underlines the Commission. “Everyone will decide and the Union will support the States, on a practical and operational level, to face the challenges of demography and migration”, we insist in Brussels. In 2021, it was Parliament that invited her to propose measures aimed at harmonizing reception conditions, simplifying procedures and combating clandestine work.
234	8	It should first concern Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, then Senegal, Nigeria, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Countries which are already linked to the EU by various agreements in the field of immigration, but which also provide large contingents of illegal immigrants. What confirms that the project aims primarily at a rebalancing of the relationship between the countries concerned and Europe, and at a kind of give-and-take: Europe would offer more openness to regulated migration in exchange for a better control of illegal immigration. This was one of the objectives of the “migration pact” defined by Brussels, the adoption of which still encounters difficulties. Under the impetus of the French presidency of the EU, it was therefore agreed between the Twenty-Seven that it was necessary to favor progress in stages, of which this initiative is part.
234	10	It remains to be seen whether third countries, which are often reluctant to accept the return of their nationals deprived of a residence permit in an EU country, will resolve to facilitate readmissions in exchange for measures for their best-educated citizens. . They should benefit from more flexible decisions on work permits, residence rights and respect for fundamental rights. The Commission also insists on its desire to allow young people, who may be less educated, to travel and work more easily in the Union. And also to promote access to entrepreneurship for others, particularly in the key sector of new technologies. The mobility of all within the European area should also be made easier.
2340	1	When will there be a joint LR-FN proposal on remigration?
2340	3	The past week has been marked by Republican proposals on immigration. It was a long-awaited step forward. These proposals are very similar to those of the National Front. This is a convergence of struggles that I find sympathetic! All of this is going in the right direction, but the essential is missing: remigration, aka the reversal of migratory flows.
2340	5	"Indeed, the birth rate of foreigners already present in France will be enough to overwhelm us in a few decades. Everyone knows that Algeria had a million inhabitants in the time of Abd El Kader, 9 million Muslims in 1962 when the French had to leave on pain of death, and 45 million now. What horror if the supporters of French Algeria had won! However, there are currently more Muslims in France than there were in Algeria in 1962. And they understood perfectly that the belly of their wives was a weapon against which our ""State of Law"" condemned us to impotence. A very simple calculation shows that an initial minority of 10% who have six children per couple becomes a majority in two generations compared to the initial 90% who have only two children."
2340	7	Faced with this predicted disaster, respect for politically correct propriety seems ridiculous to me. Even if the reaction of the social body of origin were to result, in terms of the Code of Nationality, by a legal mess such as the return to the right of blood with retroactive effect. We hear from here the beautiful souls and their “return to the darkest hours of our history”. The identity of France and the right of the French to live in a country they love according to the laws they have in principle chosen are at this price.
2340	9	However, I understand that what I am saying here is publicly unspeakable for a politician at the national level. We can still keep it in mind without mentioning it in the press.
2340	11	On a related subject, I find that the similarity of the proposals of LR and the FN should result in an electoral agreement, which Laurent Wauquiez always affects to vehemently reject.
2340	13	"What's to lose? The departure of Mesdames Pécresse and Calmels, or of Misters Appeared or of Calan? Big deal. Let them join the Centrists of Mr. Lagarde, or even the ""walkers""! The places are already taken there and they will die out without any popular support. The vast majority of LR supporters will not even regret them."
2341	3	By recognizing nuclear and natural gas as green, the EU affirmed human well-being and environmental progress, rather than renewable energy dogmatism…
2341	5	The most influential climate activist in the world, with no dolphins in sight, is Greta Thunberg.
2341	7	Time Magazine named her Person of the Year 2019 and it seems inevitable that she will eventually win the Nobel Peace Prize, if not this year.
2341	9	"With her 14 million Instagram followers and five million Twitter followers, everything she does is news. Reuters named it one of its top ""Moments of 2021"". Thunberg singing and dancing during a “Climate Live” promotional concert ahead of the United Nations climate negotiations."
2341	11	But for all her fame, Ms Thunberg's political clout has never been weaker.
2341	13	"Two weeks ago, Thunberg and other leaders in the fight against climate change demanded that Europe not fund nuclear power plants or natural gas production, but the European Commission rejected his demands and confirmed on Saturday that nuclear and natural gas will be considered sustainable and will therefore be eligible for EU funding. The agreement on the EU's ""sustainable taxonomy"" seems to be a compromise between France, which depends on nuclear power, and Germany, which is increasingly dependent on gas."
2341	15	Thunberg remains powerful. Until recently, many analysts believed that shareholder activism aimed at forcing divestment from oil and gas production was strictly tokenism, merely a way to draw attention to the need for public policy. It is now clear that this activism has been remarkably effective in suppressing private sector funding for oil and gas exploration and production, contributing to shortages. This was due, in large measure, to Thunberg's extraordinary reach and emotional connection to young people, including students, and the children of the financial, journalistic and intellectual elites.
2341	17	But the EU's decision to ratify gas and nuclear as green products is a blow to Thunberg and the climate and renewables lobby.
2341	19	It follows the collapse of Biden's climate agenda, in part because it would make the United States dangerously dependent on renewable energy; to the hypocrisy of European diplomats during the UN climate negotiations, who demanded that Africa remain pure of coal and gas while European energy ministers rushed to burn coal and acquire natural gas; and, now, Germany replacing half of its nuclear power plants with coal and natural gas.
2341	21	What is going on ? Just a few weeks ago, it seemed that Europe was making a “renewable energy transition”.
2343	3	Various technocratic and/or militant devices make it possible to scatter the real costs of immigration in a puzzle-like fashion, in order to make them less impressive. But sometimes, a grain of sand seizes the mechanics and reveals unknown chasms. This is the case in Loire-Atlantique with Accompagnement Migrants Integration (AMI).
2343	5	This 1901 law association was created in 2006 with the aim of professional and continuing training, and more specifically the “integration of asylum seekers into French society through compulsory activities or preparation for return assistance”. In 2020, she hit the jackpot: the Ministry of Labor made her one of the beneficiaries of its skills investment plan (PIC). The purpose of which is, in short, to put people with refugee status or subsidiary protection to work.
2343	7	It's not that simple, though! “Newcomers are very motivated, but those who obtain their refugee status are tempted to take advantage of the system,” says Catherine Libault, founder of AMI, quoted in 2019 by Amandine Penna in Médiacités. In other words, it is easy to make asylum seekers work, but it becomes difficult once their request is satisfied! Obtaining refugee status does not have the main advantage of the right to stay in France (most of the rejected ones stay there anyway!) but the right to live in the assistantship...
2343	9	Learn to be lazy
2343	11	This revelation naturally outrages immigrationist circles. But it is confirmed by a report by Valérie Oppelt (also cited by Amandine Penna), devoted to the integration of migrants through work. The Macronist deputy from Nantes writes this: “Migrants who arrive in France are by definition in precarious situations. However, associations explain to them how to get out of it by using the flaws and “little tricks” of the system. Some social workers, social workers or volunteers teach them assistantship. Once their file has been accepted, those who become refugees know perfectly well the possibilities available to them in terms of job abandonment, unemployment, social assistance, etc. According to the own words of some migrants, France teaches them to be lazy. »
2343	13	There are many simple jobs likely to be entrusted to poorly trained migrants or migrants who speak French badly, especially in market gardening. It's not the jobs that are lacking, it's the candidates. (Ukrainian women are working hard, yes, but there aren't enough of them to save the day). If we want to satisfy employers, it is therefore tempting to sell them illegal immigrants who only want to work rather than refugees with the magic stamp who only ask not to work.
2343	15	This is apparently the little game that AMI indulged in. This constitutes a clear violation of the conditions of the PIC, supposed to earn him 474,300 euros in state subsidies (not to mention the various subsidies received from local authorities). The prefect therefore cut off the tap, and the association plunged. Definitively ? The Loire-Atlantique prefecture, which ostensibly honored AMI in 2020, should find a way to pay anyway…
2343	16	Foreign miners exhaust their benefactors
2343	18	"Meanwhile, the employees of the Association Saint-Benoît-Labre (they often prefer to say ""ASBL""!) in Nantes are agitated. They demonstrated last Tuesday in front of the hotel of the department. The problem is recurrent; they had already gone on strike last September. Their work is too hard. What work ? It is to them that the Loire-Atlantique department has sub-contracted its obligations with regard to unaccompanied minors (MNA). One permanent for twelve miners is not enough, they say. And it is true that their public is especially restless: unaccompanied minors are responsible for a good part of the thefts and assaults on public roads in Nantes."
2345	3	France will no longer buy oil from Russia, it's over! We'll see what we'll see.
2345	5	France will buy oil from India to sanction Russia.
2345	7	India will buy oil from Russia.
2345	9	India will resell this oil to France, applying in all commercial logic a profit margin in passing!
2345	10	Russian oil? It's over !!!
2345	12	French motorists and industrialists will contribute to enriching Russia and India by paying ever more for the fuels absolutely essential to the functioning of our economy.
2345	14	If the leaders who govern us had stopped their studies at college, they would not even have had to think to conclude that such a solution was invalid. Alas, they have done great studies and are loaded with prestigious diplomas authorizing them to take us for fools.
2345	16	"French people, will you understand one day soon that we are considered low-level morons, we the France of En-Bas, the ""Toothless"" and that it is time to take back our destiny in our own hands."
2345	18	Let's start by dislodging and sending back to their homes all these professional politicians who get elected, re-elected, re-re-elected again and again, demagogically speaking without tangible results.
2345	20	At the last legislative elections, newcomers arrived and quickly turned into obedient sheep, voting for anything and everything. OUT !!!
2345	22	Let's elect newcomers to politics provided that they have the concern to protect the sovereignty of France and the freedoms and security of the French and WATCH THEM!
2345	24	How ? The solution is simple, non-violent, unavoidable by the “adversary”.
2345	26	To be continued…
2345	28	A solution that can be applied to the media who deliver us an insipid soup dictated by the subsidizers puncturing our taxes.
2345	30	How not to be overwhelmed by the irresponsibility of these individuals considering that the little people are not worth much and have only one right: TO BE QUIET! We are French citizens and we should be proud of it. The founding texts of the Fifth Republic confer upon us rights and duties. Any Frenchman fulfilling his obligations by behaving as an honest citizen and taxpayer who respects the laws and rules which govern this country has the right to express his thoughts and his opinions as to the way in which he is considered by the individuals who hold the powers. legislative and executive of our country.
2346	3	"Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy declared during a press briefing during the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 31 May: ""We have learned from the war in Ukraine that the commerce, the rule of law, are not enough and that it is not enough to be a good civil power"". “We must also be a military power,” he concluded in front of the cameras."
2346	5	His words, therefore, testify to a change in the essence of European politics as we know it.
2346	7	Until recently, against the backdrop of aggressive US policy on all continents, the EU looked like a relatively peaceful association. The complicity of the European powers in the wars against Yugoslavia and Iraq is flagrant. The war launched by the latter against Libya has remained in the shadow of American military power. Now, the political organization based in Brussels seems ready to put on the uniform of militarization, using it as a means to achieve political ends.
2346	9	From the EU of peace to the EU of war. This, apparently, is what, in this context, has dictated the declarations on the need for the EU to have its own army, as well as the adjustment of European legal instruments to justify the supply of arms to the armies foreign. The function of this EU, by giving authorization to the authorities of Denmark, Croatia, Poland and Latvia to allow the citizens of their respective countries to fight for kyiv, in fact, as mercenaries, while the official objective of this EU is to promote peace, leave speechless.
2346	11	"For example, when presenting the Nobel Peace Prize in Brussels in 2012, the then President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, declared that the EU stood for the values ​​of ""freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights"", and that these were the values ​​to which people ""aspire"" all over the world. But now, still uttering the word “peace”, Europe talks about the need to have its own army and to increase military spending."
2346	13	The militarization of the EU will be the beginning of the end of the idea of ​​a united Europe. The duplication of the military functions of each EU Member State within the framework of the European army – hitherto hypothetical -, given their participation in NATO, will not be enough. A further increase in defense spending exceeding 2% of NATO's GDP will not be enough either. A radical reconfiguration, not only, of intra-European defense mechanisms, but also of their legal component, as well as of European foreign policy concepts, will be necessary.
2346	15	Boris Johnson's secret plan to separate Ukraine from Russia and the EU. This new military choreography threatens to provoke a conflict of interest between the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, the Anglo-Saxons have no interest in reinforcing the geopolitical and military subjectivity of Europe.
2346	17	For example, London's plan to create a certain European Community (European Commonwealth) within the EU, as against Brussels, revealed by the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, testifies to this dissonance among the allies.
2346	19	The Community, according to the British plan, should include Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine and, potentially, Turkey. For the moment, only the Italian daily has revealed details on this issue and there have been no official statements from London on this subject. But, the presence in the list of countries presenting their candidacy, of Ukraine – a country which has no economic potential and which sees its military potential being artificially inflated – betrays its current geopolitical leadership. Here, one can easily assume that it is a question of increasing the influence of London in Eastern Europe by relying on these countries with the aim of interfering with the Franco-German couple. With the presence of the Eastern European countries mentioned above, the Anglo-Saxon geopolitical axis formed by Washington and London clearly wants to acquire solid rear bases to counter the continental geopolitical axis Berlin-Paris.
2346	21	The Anglo-Saxons do not like the very idea of ​​strengthening the military potential of the EU. Because the EU even considers regions as distant as the Sahel and the Middle East as being a theater of application of European military diplomacy, where London, precisely, considers Brussels as an undesirable competitor. The British press refers to the fundamental principles of the EU and underlines that for the first time in history, a military component is included in its budget. But, such a tone of the British is not dictated by the concern to see peace hovering over geopolitics. We see the desire to carry, in advance, an informational and propaganda shock against Brussels.
2346	23	Nevertheless, there is truth in the rhetoric of the Anglo-Saxons. If European arms deliveries to countries in Africa and the Middle East begin, it will complicate the situation in the regions because political clans will use the possible alternatives as a channel for dialogue with competitors. It is therefore obvious that London and Washington are afraid to review the existing model – American-centric and British-centric – of economic relations with Third World countries. The reinforcement of France, Italy, Germany could break the vestiges of the hegemony of the United States and the United Kingdom in these regions.
2346	25	The EU now invokes the famous “Russian threat” to justify the strengthening of its military power, as Le Figaro headlines: “Europe wants to strengthen its defense by beefing up its industry”. The desire to admit Sweden and Finland into NATO is now explained precisely by this. Moreover, the press adheres to this tone of presentation of events in Germany as well as in France and Italy, the first European powers of the bloc.
2346	27	At the same time, Russia is only one of the possible competitors for the future European army. China will turn out to be the other. This new military orientation within the EU is dictated by the intensification of Russian and Chinese policies in Africa and the Middle East, which Europe, out of inertia, has become accustomed to considering as its postcolonial stronghold, and by the growing global confrontation around the world.
2346	29	From the EU of peace, to the EU of war, to its liquefaction. Thus, the possible militarization of the EU can lead to a struggle and a competition with several geopolitical centers at the same time: the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, without forgetting a struggle within the EU itself. 'Europe. The question is whether Washington and London, through their influence on the policy of the countries of Eastern Europe, will be able to resist these plans or whether they will steer the process of militarization of the EU in a direction that will will be beneficial? Will the EU dare to take such a step in a context of growing economic threats?
2347	3	The Russian missile targeting a hospital in Mariupol mistakenly crashed into a Ukrainian army camp, killing at least fifteen soldiers.
2347	5	The Ukrainian army confirms numerous losses after a Russian bombardment targeting civilians mistakenly hit a military base near Mariupol. Already last week, several Russian air raids targeting convoys of civilians seeking to flee the city of Kharkiv had mistakenly destroyed a site housing Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses.
2347	7	"A new bombardment which goes against Russian strategy according to Thomas Lacamp, an expert in Russian-Ukrainian conflicts since 1975. ""For several weeks, the Russians have been on a very strict line: a dirty war, the aim of which is to terrorize Ukrainian civilian populations”. For him, everything points to a targeting error on the part of the Russian army, which claims to do everything possible to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers."
2348	3	The Americans may have trumpeted “war is imminent”, we said to ourselves “this is a bluff. They are push-to-crime”. We preferred to believe that the imposing mobilization of the Russian army on the border of Ukraine and inside Belarus was only theater. A tensioning of Vladimir Putin to obtain what he has been asking for for years: guarantees on the security of Russia, a renegotiation of the balances in Europe. Request repeated in November, no one having dared to tell the Ukrainians that they would never enter NATO, his pet peeve. He took action. The road was clear, Joe Biden having declared: “Not an American soldier in Ukraine. ”
2348	4	Ukraine, an accident of history for Putin
2348	6	Putin never digested the dislocation of the USSR in 1991. Westerners are, according to him, responsible for this humiliation of Russia. Ukraine is in his eyes an accident of history, an artificial creation. It is unbearable to him that the Ukrainians are happy to live in a democracy. He despises President Zelensky, democratically elected, a sort of Coluche, very popular in Russia. He thought of making short work of it, dislodging him quickly to replace him with a puppet power, bringing him to Moscow to put him on trial for genocide.
2348	8	Things don't go the way he wanted. He discovers a courageous warlord Zelensky, who stimulates the national feeling of the Ukrainians. Their heroism and that of their president aroused the admiration of public opinion in Europe. The military superiority of Russia is obvious, its appetites very threatening. Putin has the means to do a lot of damage. How far will he go? “He lost touch with reality,” said Angela Merkel. In front of his European hosts, facing Emmanuel Macron for five hours, he stirs like jam his victimizing, acrimonious, obsessive rhetoric against the West.
2348	10	"Stalin was the greatest criminal of the 20th century. This past is the basis of the history of the Soviet Union. Putin is its successor. Society is muzzled, violent repression. When his opponents are not assassinated (47 journalists killed in twenty years), they languish in prison, like Alexeï Navalny. Putin studied at the KGB, he is even a physical embodiment of it: hairless face, without wrinkles, expressionless, swollen cheeks (cortisone or Botox, one wonders) which make him a mask behind which he hides. And then there's that weird, empty stare. He stares at his interlocutors without seeing them, like a cat. Glacial. An elusive personality. Even when angry, he speaks in a sugary, flat tone, including when threatening Westerners with “consequences you never knew.” Was he referring to the nuclear bomb? He didn't utter the word until Sunday, when he was seen ordering two frozen, frightened generals to ""put the Russian army's deterrent forces on special combat alert."" Just before proposing to the Ukrainian president to negotiate. If he chose war, it is because he is certain that democracies are cowardly countries. He hates in us the rule of law, freedom."
2348	11	An unexpected reaction
2348	13	But amazement. Ukrainians are resisting, Western leaders have agreed on a package of massive economic sanctions that should hurt Russia badly. Putin believed Europe divided, the Twenty-Seven are united. The Germans, who sent 5,000 helmets on the first day, change gear. Chancellor Olaf Scholz broke a taboo by announcing the upcoming delivery of 1,000 anti-tank missiles, 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles and 9 howitzers to the Ukrainian army and ordered a 100 billion euro rearmament of Germany. A revolution ! Another miracle, NATO is getting back on track.
2348	15	The response from the besieged heightens the challenge for Russia, which hardens its tone, sends Chechen commandos to do the dirty work on the ground and shells the cities. We haven't seen it all yet. We begin to despair, and yet we still want to believe that the worst is not certain, since the dialogue with Putin continues.
2349	1	To those who like to be scared with the Covid: to be even more scared...
2349	3	Playing wolves, witches, vampires... Between three and eight years old, children love to scare themselves. Now we discover that there are also many adults.
2349	5	60 to 70% of them would be very satisfied with the health pass soon to be vaccinated. There would therefore be 40 to 47 million French people who believe in government lies and the great global Covid disinformation campaign. Most say they are wary of the media, 80% hate Macron… however, trust them completely when it comes to covid and covid information…
2349	7	Almost two years have passed, a lot of proven, sourced data has been made available to them. Some figures have leaked, including those for hospitalizations… Eminent specialists, such as Laurent Toubiana, Christian Perronne, Jean-Michel Claverie… have alerted them to the biggest lie of all time. We explained to them that, taking advantage of the windfall effect, Macron and his mafia… worked tirelessly to enslave them.
2349	9	Obediently, they obeyed all the injunctions, each more delusional than the other, to the deprivation of freedoms, as being subject to a QR code to drink coffee or play sports is one of them.
2349	11	We can only deduce that around 40 to 47 million French adults want to play Covid and have immense fears. What is extremely serious is that they drag their children into their excesses, having them vaccinated, letting them be mistreated in schools and colleges, by all kinds of covid bullying, with the wearing of a mandatory mask...
2349	13	To all these French people, we must remind you that they are now on a leash and that their choke collar will not stop tightening... that the next step, before subcutaneous chipping, is called Digital ID Wallet or digital wallet European Union, which will collect all the information concerning them and that, at its discretion, the government may decide to prohibit such access or action.
235	3	The European Union is reportedly about to decree an embargo on Russian oil, but is awaiting the outcome of the French presidential election, so as not to favor the candidacy of Marine Le Pen.
235	4	The war in Ukraine continues, on the 51st day of the Russian offensive. According to information from the New York Times, which Le Figaro echoed on Friday April 15, the European Union is about to decree an embargo on Russian oil. However, according to the American daily, negotiations on the terms of this embargo should not begin until after the second round of the French presidential election, which will be held on April 24. And this, to avoid favoring the candidacy of Marine Le Pen.
235	5	The objective of this approach would therefore be to ensure that the impact of such a measure on the rise in the price of energy could not favor the candidate of the National Rally. And thus destroy the chances of the president-candidate Emmanuel Macron. At least that is what the New York newspaper claims, which relies on official and diplomatic sources.
235	7	The embargo on Russian oil is a measure vis-à-vis which a number of governments say they are reluctant and could drag on. The measure is “complex” and will take “several months”, indicated a source quoted by Le Figaro. “The adoption of measures on oil requires unwinding existing contracts, finding alternatives and avoiding their circumvention. It's not going to happen overnight. It will take at least several months,” said a European official.
2350	1	CGT and antifa want to prevent Zemmour from speaking to Zenith
2350	3	If Zemmour is the pet peeve of antifas, Islamo-leftists, immigrationist associations, indigenists and other decolonialists, it is only because they are all afraid that Z will line them up in his crosshairs and above all that he will suppress their juicy subsidies, once in power.
2350	5	Because it is with our taxes that these enemies of democracy want to impose their law!
2350	7	By demonstrating against Zemmour on each of his trips, it is their cake that they are defending and only their cake, under the guise of anti-racism.
2350	9	It should be noted that not a single journalist, not a single political leader, opposes these intolerable violations of democracy, in the midst of the electoral campaign.
2350	11	In the land of freedom, all that France counts as enemies of the Republic and of democracy, all this revolutionary and Islamo-leftist movement, all these antifas who hate freedom of expression, intend to silence Eric Zemmour, the December 5 at the Zenith.
2350	13	Because for these bearers of political morality, only their Marxist ideology has the right of citizenship. Nothing really new, of course, history has proven their power of nuisance and their turpitude.
2350	15	These defenders of freedom of expression call themselves “progressives”, while Zemmour is of course the abominable fascist, the high priest of the far right who must be put down.
2350	17	With these fanatics, any debate of ideas is impossible. Loving and defending one's homeland is fascism.
2350	19	Their favorite fatal weapon is still and always intellectual terrorism.
2350	21	Any adversary must suffer their censorship, their lies and their violence. Among these professionals of the event, the debate does not exist. We never dialogue, we always demonstrate.
2350	23	They are the same ones who exalted the communist ideology which caused 100 million deaths.
2350	25	They are the same people who in the past praised Stalin, Mao, Castro, Pol-Pot, the greatest criminals in history.
2350	27	It was not until 1941, when Hitler invaded Russia, that the Communists suddenly discovered an anti-Nazi patriotic streak. A bit late after the 1940 defeat.
2350	29	During the Indochina war, they were for Ho Chi Minh.
2350	31	During the Algerian war, they were on the FLN side, betraying our soldiers.
2350	33	They praised decolonization and fought Western imperialism, but at the same time they supported the USSR which was colonizing the countries of Eastern Europe, keeping them under its implacable yoke.
2350	35	Because the morality of the left, it is in the mouth of the customer.
2350	37	It should therefore come as no surprise that, after so many betrayals throughout history, this Marxist movement which calls itself “progressive”, puts Eric Zemmour in the camp of fascists, racists, xenophobes and Islamophobes.
2350	39	A great patriot determined to defend our identity and our cultural heritage, he is a fascist who must be silenced. This is the ideology of the French extreme left.
2350	41	As Jean Sévilla wrote in his book “Intellectual Terrorism”, it is a totalitarian mechanism that has been in place for decades to crush opponents of far-left ideas.
2350	43	Insults, anathema, lies, amalgamation, trial of intent and witch hunts are part of the panoply of intellectual terrorism. Not to mention the violent demonstrations.
2350	45	This is how the CGT and the antifas are calling for the formation of “a wide range of progressive organizations against far-right ideas” on December 5.
2350	47	Note that the discourse has not changed for 70 years.
2350	49	“On December 5, Paris will silence Zemmour”, announces the CGT.
2350	51	"For our defenders of Zemmourian patriotism, December 5 at the Zenith, is only ""the fascist high mass"" of the candidate."
2350	53	"An event to which we must oppose ""a rally against the fascist word""."
2350	55	"Because Zemmour ""unpacks his hate speech everywhere"", as well as:"
2350	57	“His racist, Islamophobic, misogynistic, ultra-liberal speech, his rehabilitation of the worst figures in our recent history are spreading, with the blind or assumed complicity of those who constantly reach out to him for the microphone or offer him platforms. »
2350	59	“We have a historic responsibility”
2350	61	“fascist groups are growing wings and are increasing their abuses”
2350	63	Nothing really new, therefore, in the hackneyed discourse of this French extreme left, which has never supported patriotic speech.
2350	65	On December 5, facing the patriot Zemmour, who wants to save the Nation from the wreckage of identity, it is the enemy movement of freedom that will try to silence him, but in vain.
2351	3	He stamps on the spot. Shaken like an Orangina, he slobbers and chokes. Loses sleep. Turns paranoid and wears bulletproof vests even in the salons of the Élysée.
2351	5	"Jean-Britt is very worried when her lover makes incoherent remarks during his unexpected mood swings. ""Ilelle"" trembled when the kid belched that he was going to annoy these unvaccinated French bastards to the hilt. And all those who no longer want its poisons. The backlash could be terrible!"
2351	7	Who still wants this puppet?
2351	9	The horror if his New World Order sponsors played him the same pig trick as in Hollandouille! Considering it more grilled than a charcoal merguez.
2351	10	Macron: exile or prison?
2351	12	"Because, well, a gay in the presidency, we are neither stuck nor puritanical, we ended up getting used to it. But a retarded teenager, a temperamental puppet of which a succubus with an indefinable sex pulls the strings, that would end up making people talk. Especially when ""normal"" substitutes jostle at the gate."
2351	14	Despite the derogatory remarks and taunts he received from Trump, Putin, Bolsonaro, Erdogan and even a few African wrens, the tyrant had managed to maintain the illusion that he was an international heavyweight. He believed that this could compensate for the detestation and contempt he inspires in the French. But here it is… Since he wanted to play führer in Eurocrature, humiliations and evasions have multiplied.
2351	16	"Heads of State or Government do not have time to receive him, the crowd overwhelms him with boos and jeers, MEPs throw his 4 truths at him, and journalists refuse to enter into the subterfuge of questions -answers agreed in advance and prefer to leave. The despot begins to rediscover the real world. Far from the thuriferous of his court, the loufiats of his media, and his ""supporters"" recruited among the intermittents of the show."
2351	18	Certainly, no one can prevent him from representing himself. But let him think it over. With only his savings as capital, without the unconditional support of the media-liars and pollsters-tricksters, he would not go further than prison, having lost his immunity in the process.
2351	20	Especially since the replacement has already been found. Attali the Attila of modern times, predicted it: “Next time, it will be a real woman. “And as we can doubt that he selected Marine or Sandrine…
2351	22	His salvation would be in flight!
2351	24	McKinsey had decided on the timetable: Disappearance of the pangolin flu at the end of 2021, a mild cold replaces it at the beginning of 2022, and in the spring, the conductor proclaims that, thanks to his wise decisions and his indomitable energy, the evil is overthrown.
2351	26	With the bonus of the promise that we will talk again about the Nazi passes at the Greek calends. Missed, the rabid sheep no longer graze on this bitter grass!
2351	28	Macronescu knows that the polls carried out by independent institutes, Swiss and Belgian, place him in a range of 10 to 12%. While Éric, closely followed by Marine, evolves around 16 – 18%.
2351	30	However, the despot still has a chance to avoid prison, and the humiliation of leaving in the salad cart under the boos and spitting of the crowd.
2351	32	"He could even give himself the beautiful role: Playing the valiant knights by declaring that after reflection, he gave up representing himself because Jean-Brizitte is too unhappy with the campaign of slander unleashed against ""ilelle"". And couldn't take all that nastiness five more years."
2352	3	"With Joe Biden, tensions between Russia and the United States are stronger than during the Cold War and exacerbated with the conflict in Ukraine. Why is the Democratic administration so hawkish on Russia? In my latest book, Have we reached the end of the story? (VA Éditions, 2021), I explained why, far surpassing Reagan and even Nixon, Donald Trump was the most reviled and decried American president by Western Intelligentsias and the mainstream media. His rough, crude, aggressive ""populist"" style was expertly crafted. A real ""dog in a game of skittles"" shaking up all the political and diplomatic codes, which greatly shocked the well-meaning elites. However, the former tenant of the White House was perhaps the most “independent” and “anti-system” president in American history. His incessant fight against political correctness as well as his own and powerful establishment, against winds and tides or rather against hurricanes and tsunamis, and while keeping his electoral promises (very rare these days…), made all the popularity of this politician unconventional and unprofessional with ""peripheral America"". Thus, Trump has been blithely underestimated. He was neither a ""madman"" nor a ""clown"" as many wanted to describe him to us. Admittedly, he was an ignoramus in international relations but he was far from being an idiot! One does not reach the head of the first power in the world by being a sinister imbecile! The former businessman from New York, connected to reality, excelled in the art of negotiation and the assessment of power relations. A good manager (in the American style of course), he knew how to surround himself very well. He was also a pure realist. A nationalist certainly, but a non-interventionist who no longer wanted the United States to spend crazy sums to interfere in world affairs and most often play sorcerer's apprentice as we have seen in recent decades."
2354	3	This is the last time I will speak on Covid news as a citizen in an opinion piece. First of all, because the Western politico-media power has found another bogeyman than COVID to scare its population. Then, because although I concede to hypersensitive readers of Quebec the right to complain and to try to censor those who do not think like them, I leave to others the pleasure of being cowardly intimidated under the nauseating cover of virtue. I will therefore leave the controversy to the polemicists, not without offering a final comment on the news which will be fleshed out with a more general reflection.
2354	5	The situation in Ukraine
2354	7	I will start with a brief remark on the Russian-Ukrainian war. The woke and moralizing West is once again getting lost in the cancel culture by canceling everything directly or indirectly related to Russia and by amalgamating Russian consumer products, Russian hockey players, Russian symphony orchestras in Vladimir Cheese fries. You really have to be naive to believe that stopping selling vodka at the SAQ and preventing Russian teenagers from playing World Juniors will change anything in the Putin clan's military strategy. Other than making pathetic ostentatious virtue and making conformists feel like they're on the right side of history, that won't advance the schmilblick!
2354	9	"I ardently encourage readers to watch this lecture by John Mearsheimer[1], professor of political science at the University of Chicago and specialist in American foreign policy, who explains with a different narrative the ins and outs of the Russian crisis -Ukrainian, referring among other things to the failure to respect the balance of power on the part of the United States and the Atlanticist camp. In addition to Mearsheimer's lecture, the ARTE report entitled ""The Return of the Bear"" is very instructive with regard to Russian motivations in foreign policy."
2354	11	In summary, the desire to include Ukraine in NATO, a country bordering Russia and sharing with it a long ethnic and cultural history, is an example of Western aggression towards Russia which passes under the radar of our media massive. Of course, military actions are always horrible and are all the more condemnable when they affect civilian populations. Vladimir Putin's current offensive is therefore unacceptable under international law. However, is it more so than the offensives carried out by Ukraine since 2014 in the context of the Donbass war? Is it more so than the American invasion of Iraq in 2003? These events also caused civilian deaths without, however, arousing the ire of Western well-meaning.
2354	13	"Are the Russians the dangerous out-of-control aggressors wantonly preying on Ukraine as we are portrayed from morning to night in the news reports? Do they instead apply the principle of self-defense of their strategic geopolitical positions? The reality is not an American Western and it is certainly much less simplistic than that described for a week in our ""official"" press organs."
2354	14	The irresponsibility of the media
2354	16	I believe that media incompetence is at its peak. At a time when science is questioning the containment strategy used by the majority of Western countries[3] and raising serious questions about the safety of the vaccines we have always been sold as safe and effective[4 ], now the media attention is turning elsewhere and COVID seems to no longer exist. As André Bercoff puts it, Putin should be given a Nobel Prize in Medicine for making COVID disappear in less than a week, which life-saving pharmaceuticals failed to do in two years of strenuous effort.
2354	18	I hope that vigilant Quebecers will not fall for the trap and will be faithful to their motto by remembering for a long time the catastrophic health management of the Legault government. As far as I'm concerned, everything surrounding COVID is far from closed. It therefore seems important to me not to put it under the rug and say another word about it.
2354	20	Take, for example, how the media treated what was called the “freedom convoy”. How could they cover the truckers' demonstration in Ottawa so badly? Hundreds of millions of dollars in media wage subsidies and “COVID ads” alone cannot explain such an attitude of the journalistic corps[5].
2354	22	Several media (not all, it should be noted) relayed without nuance the rantings of Prime Minister Trudeau who claimed that the demonstrators were white supremacists, transphobes, homophobes, misogynists, neo-Nazi far-right groups, lark! Even the respected Chantal Hébert entered the dance by relaying in the most serious way, without the usual verifications, the words of a person who called himself “a white supremacist” out of irony and mockery towards Justin Trudeau. That says it all!
2354	24	How could they follow Trudeau on his ramblings and pass off a mostly celebratory and peaceful protest as a gathering threatening the nation's security? If the journalists did their job at all, the Kafkaesque introduction and withdrawal of the Emergency Measures Act would never have taken place because the government would have come under too much criticism from the start. Let us console ourselves, all this only reveals even more clearly the politics of exaggeration, governance by fear and the abuse of the concept of emergency that the political and media power has been advocating for two years now. The aplaventrism and lies of the mainstream media have become so crass that it is hard to see how they will maintain their credibility in the long run.
2354	26	Since the beginning of the health crisis, the mass media have been the spokespersons, even the amplifiers of the official discourse of the authorities, always trying to discredit those who express themselves otherwise. The recent article by Nicholas de Rosa about an interview conducted by Éloïse Boies with three Quebec scientists is a good example of this undermining work carried out by the so-called supporters of the truth[7]. What about the departure of Francine Pelletier from the newspaper Le Devoir or that of Stéphan Bureau from Radio-Canada in 2021. Quebec journalism is far from healthy and more and more people are noticing it.
2354	28	Consequently, unless our governments pass laws to shut down alternative news sites and censor social media as a whole, many citizens, especially younger ones, will inevitably migrate to news platforms which, tell me, don't take them for idiots. Obviously, alternative information is not flawless. No media can claim total objectivity. Fake news and factual errors will continue to be seen, both in alternative and mainstream media.
2355	3	Shot on biotox and facelifts, puffy on cortisone, misanthropic, irrational gay, autistic, cancerous, brutal, obsessive, very afraid of shamans, parkinsonian, totally crazy, suffering from gunslinger gait syndrome… Over the decades, the 'we have attributed to Vladimir Putin, all the failings, all the physical and mental illnesses and more, since the NATO/Russia conflict… And in the ambient grayness, it is Here who comes to rejoice us.
2355	4	"“Elon Musk believes he is not the richest man in the world. It was with the Insider site on March 26 that he explained this. When the journalist asked him ""How do you feel as the richest person in the world?"" His response may have surprised: ""I think Putin is much richer than me,"" he said. As of April 3, 2022, the businessman's wealth is estimated at 287.6 billion (260 billion euros), according to Forbes magazine. »"
2355	6	"“The master of the Kremlin receives an annual salary of 140,000 dollars (127,000 euros), reported the Site Fortune on March 26. ""But many think that's just the tip of the iceberg... This is the case with Bill Browder, who testified to The Atlantic in 2017. He estimates that Vladimir Putin ""has accumulated $200 billion ( 181 billion euros) of ill-gotten gains"". Many assets are attributed to Vladimir Putin: a 1.4 billion dollar palace on the Black Sea, a 4 million dollar apartment in Monaco and, a 100 million dollar yacht, 19 houses, 700 cars, 58 planes and helicopters, and among them a $716 million aircraft. But Vladimir Putin denies all this: the properties are not in his name, but in various companies or Russian oligarchs. »"
2355	8	"In this case, he is right to deny. With the Kremlin's car fleet and Russian state planes, owning 700 cars and 58 planes on top of that would really be a psychiatric problem. It is therefore no coincidence that this delusional ""info"" has just fallen. Since the start of the NATO/Russia conflict, Americans and Europeans have been trying tirelessly to pass off Putin as a madman and the clown Zelenski, disguised as a television soldier, as a hero."
2359	3	From Brussels to Washington, the sound of boots follows martial declarations. Transfer of heavy weapons, intensification of the economic war via a new package of sanctions: the military solution and the choice of confrontation are essential against a negotiated solution. Now is the time for war.
2359	5	"A phoney war, however, since, at the same time, Americans and Europeans explain that above all they do not want to appear as ""co-belligerents"", under penalty of triggering... a ""Third World War"". Another curiosity: to announce a desire to set up a European embargo on Russian oil and, at the same time, via Emmanuel Macron, to ask Russia to be kind enough to lift its blockade of food exports."
2359	7	"Europe wants war, but does not wage it, while asking its adversary not to take too penalizing retaliatory measures. To make matters worse, Westerners, since the start of the conflict, have multiplied provocations by calling Vladimir Putin all the names and wondering about his mental health. Journalist Renaud Girard, in Le Figaro on May 2, was concerned about this ""verbal one-upmanship"" and the persistent refusal of the West to ""take into account the feelings of the adversary"", which is one of the bases of diplomacy."
2359	9	There is therefore strong reason to fear that the Europeans will find themselves trapped in an escalation over which they risk gradually losing control. Locked in a process of escalation to extremes, each party now expresses more and more clearly its capacity or its will to destroy the other.
2359	11	Seized by the dizziness of hubris, Joe Biden, on March 26 in Warsaw, declared that Vladimir Putin, whom he had just described as a “butcher”, could not remain in power. A month later, the head of the Pentagon, Llyod Austin, declared that Ukraine could win the war if it had “the right equipment and sufficient support”. He added: “We want to see Russia weakened to such a degree that it cannot do the same kinds of things as the invasion of Ukraine. »
2359	13	Commenting on these statements, Renaud Girard remarked that, in this war, one had the impression that the White House and Congress were even more diehards than President Zelensky.
2359	15	It is therefore not peace that is sought by the Americans who are in fact trying to reproduce in Ukraine, as we mentioned last March, the strategy of the “Afghan trap”. With the idea that a bloody stalemate, associated with economic sanctions, could ultimately bring about the downfall of Putin as the defeat in Afghanistan had announced the end of the USSR.
2359	17	"In this context, convinced that this war constitutes for it a vital stake and that the West wants its loss, Russia has in turn engaged in a verbal one-upmanship, as evidenced by the declarations of Vladimir Putin, on April 27, stating that if anyone posed ""strategic threats unacceptable to Russia"", he should expect a ""stunning"" response."
2359	19	This rise to extremes is also reinforced by the systematic refusal to take into account the Russian point of view and its claims, because Russia is not seen as a strategic adversary but as an “absolute enemy”. Which is the consequence of the break with a vision of war as interstate confrontation, between sovereign powers, and its transformation into a struggle of good against evil. The demonization of Vladimir Putin and Russia is increasingly distancing the prospect of a way out of the crisis. We don't make peace with the devil, we destroy him.
2359	21	"Finally, the last element that risks leading to the worst, the ""trap of the cat stuck at the end of a corridor"". To use the observations of Chinese strategist Sun Tzu, it is the situation much more than the quality of the fighters that leads to victory or defeat. By strangling Russia economically and proclaiming that they want war in order to obtain its permanent weakening, Westerners are clearly expressing their refusal to open an acceptable way out for their adversary. Convinced, then, of having nothing more to lose, he has no other solution, like the cat trapped at the end of a corridor, than to throw all his strength at the one who threatens him."
236	3	Spain wants to consider the coronavirus as a normal flu, no longer as a pandemic but as an endemic disease. France wants to push the adoption of a Digital Pass in Europe.
236	5	How long will this health crisis suffered by the French population last? It only depends on the government, and therefore on the president himself. Because you have to be perfectly lucid: it is the government that is responsible for the health crisis, and not the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
236	6	"From the beginning, this crisis has been more political than medical, which is confirmed by the health policy of other countries. Austria seems to be backtracking on its compulsory vaccination plan, Israel is abandoning the fourth dose of vaccine, and Sweden is controlling the pandemic without ever having had either confinement or a generalized health pass. Major Danish and German newspapers apologize to readers for being ""almost hypnotically absorbed"" in the speeches of the authorities. Better late than never…"
236	7	And now Spain. Now it's Spain's turn. The Spanish government had reacted in panic mode at the start of the pandemic, but its position and that of the community of Madrid is now to let the virus spread. It is therefore one more country where the authorities seem to be returning to reason and moderation. According to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez:
236	9	“Spain wants to consider the coronavirus as a normal flu, no longer as a pandemic but as an endemic disease. »
236	11	It is a question of no longer “counting each case and no longer having recourse to the test at the slightest symptom”.
236	13	This position is all the more justified since the European Medicines Agency now believes that regular vaccination against covid can ultimately weaken the immune system.
236	15	According to Marco Cavaleri, Head of Biological Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy at the Agency:
236	16	“Boosts can be done once or even twice, but it is not something that we think needs to be repeated constantly […] We have to think about how we can move from the current pandemic context to a more endemic one. »
236	18	Pedro Sanchez elaborates the new Spanish position with transparency; he gives the figures that we would never hear from all those who sow fear in France:
236	20	“A lethality of 13% at the start of the pandemic, against a lethality of 1% with the Omicron variant. »
236	22	The French government continues to persist. The French authorities are therefore increasingly isolated in their desire to make vaccination de facto compulsory with a newly adopted vaccination pass. The position of the French government in this health crisis should be made politically untenable by an Omicron variant that is sweeping everywhere, whether the population is vaccinated or not. With hundreds of thousands of new cases per day, in just a few weeks the majority of French people could be infected. The expression French exception usually has a positive connotation, but this becomes unacceptable when it is the sign of a government with an authoritarian tendency which persists in outbidding with a vaccine pass which is useless in the face of the Omicron variant. This French government is sticking to a vaccine position which, not only has long been criticized by liberals for moral reasons, but which European governments are now gradually beginning to abandon for practical reasons. It should be remembered that Macron, in his shocking address to the French in July 2021, announced:
236	24	“To fight, only one solution: the vaccine. »
2361	1	The European energy solution? Poverty, of course!
2361	3	The European Union has a solution to combat its Russian energy dependence: even more ecology, and more poverty.
2361	5	Putin's war will have had several powerful direct and indirect effects, not all of which are, far from it, good signs.
2361	7	If we can now – with irony – present Putin as the best NATO VRP for the year 2022, so much are now displayed the inclinations of Finland and Sweden to enter the international organization, we can also worry about the enormous, not to say catastrophic, weaknesses that it has revealed for the rest of the European continent, on several levels.
2361	9	It thus appears very clear that the member countries of the European Union are not really capable of defending themselves on their soil. A bitter finding that is not new and that the fairly marked lack of cooperation at European level only makes matters worse. Some are delighted (like Commissioner Breton, first of all) to see a great opportunity to launch joint programs and thus assemble colossal funds (we are talking in tens and then soon in hundreds of billions of euros) to develop armaments shared between European countries.
2361	11	This is to forget a little quickly that all this further strengthens the power of the European executive whose democratic detachment with the peoples of Europe, increasingly strong, does not seem to bother anyone, neither in the media, nor at the heads of the Member States .
2361	13	But above all, it is to forget that a state, even a supranational one, is in no way a guarantee that citizens will be better treated, and even on the contrary: everything in history indicates that the more powerful a state becomes, the more it escapes popular control, the less it hesitates to put on deleterious or even debilitating measures. And when voices of protest are heard, precisely denouncing these idiocies, he then does not hesitate to crush his opponents.
2361	15	And precisely, question stupid decisions, we do not fail to see a package of them dawning on the occasion of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.
2361	17	A previous post already mentioned European economic sanctions against Russia, sanctions particularly well found since many European companies were paying the price. Since then, the buyout of Renault's stake by a local Russian manufacturer for a symbolic ruble has provided a concrete illustration of the disaster that is unfolding.
2361	19	We will not even be able to console ourselves by noticing that this rouble, even symbolic, acquires value at the expense of the euro since it is precisely following European decisions that its rate climbs and even exceeds that of before the war. It must be said that Europe continues to buy Russian energy products which are currently very difficult to do without.
2361	21	To govern is to foresee, but that's good: no one in the European institutions has been appointed (and even less elected) to govern. As a result, absolutely nothing has been planned, neither before the war, nor now, nor later, to avoid finding ourselves in the current situation.
2361	23	Worse, we even did the exact opposite.
2361	25	For years, and thanks to collectivist ecologists and other energy leftists infiltrating everywhere, lobbying on all sides and at all levels of all institutions of public power, a particularly shrewd energy policy has been built which has consisted of conscientiously sabotage what was working very well (nuclear), prevent an interesting alternative (shale gas) and actively promote wind and solar power, intermittent and therefore backed... by the gas and oil we is eager to seek from the Russians.
2362	3	A new report from Navdanya International calls for rejecting Bill Gates' false solutions and instead supporting an ecological approach to food and farming that can provide a lasting solution to climate change.
2362	5	In Bill Gates' vision, technology seems destined to undo all the damage that has been inflicted on our planet – and climate change has recently been added to the list.
2362	7	But it is this same mentality that has led us to the devastating stage we find ourselves in now, when the only thing that is improving exponentially is the profits of the companies that profit by selling these same technologies.
2362	9	It is necessary to get out of this technophile hysteria to reclaim a holistic vision based on real farmers, healthy and nutritious food and on an agro-ecological model which has no impact on the climate but which, on the contrary, contributes to mitigate it.
2362	10	No fake burger can do that.
2362	12	"Navdanya International's latest report, ""Bill Gates and His False Solutions to Climate Change,"" details the reasons behind Bill and Melinda Gates' attempts to focus the debate on miracle technologies and the real interests behind his propaganda."
2362	14	While Gates' numerous investments are all apparently justified by a noble humanitarian and environmental cause, the report shows that they actually allow him to impose his techno-solutionist strategy by exerting a direct influence on all types of protagonists in global development. .
2362	16	But this game of profit and partnership between billionaires is even clearer in one of Gates' most important personal investment funds: Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
2362	18	Breakthrough-funded companies are peppered with ex-DuPont, Monsanto, PepsiCo and Microsoft executives, revealing how the same companies that precipitated our health and ecological crisis are now selling us equally risky solutions to the problems they created in the first place.
2362	20	The report highlights one such technical “solution” through the example of synthetic food, which aims to replace animal products with highly processed ingredients, usually through synthetic biology. Billionaires are investing heavily in this growing market: Mr. Gates alone has spent $50 million on leading company Impossible Foods and is actively funding several others.
2362	22	Fake foods are touted as a solution to climate change and environmental degradation, but in reality, their carbon footprint is seven times that of less processed plant proteins.
2362	23	Cell-based meat also emits more greenhouse gases than some animal products, and recent research even suggests that in the long term, its environmental impact may be greater than that of livestock.
2362	25	Far from ending climate change or world hunger, fake food is still based on an industrial agricultural model, based on monocultures, toxic pesticides and GMOs, which destroys our ecosystems and threatens our health.
2362	27	The report also shows how the patenting of these artificial food cultivation techniques has become an instrument of profiteering for corporations and billionaires, shifting power from farmers to biotech companies, while completely ignoring the solutions offered by the climate change movement. regenerative agriculture.
2362	29	These technological innovations, presented as the only solutions to the world's problems, ensure the continued concentration of failing industrial models, distracting attention from the profound systemic changes that are necessary to solve the crises we face today. We do not need to go any further down the path that is already destroying our health and our biodiversity.
2362	31	Instead, we have an opportunity to truly foster an ecological approach to food and farming, which can provide a sustainable solution to climate change and ensure food sovereignty.
2362	33	Diverse local communities are already embarking on this ecological and democratic path, rehabilitating seeds, food and knowledge as commons, while deeply considering the biodiversity web to protect the Earth and the human health. The report calls for supporting this transition and rejecting the false alternatives offered by the philanthrocapitalists and private companies that are their partners.
2364	1	Open your eyes ! NATO, this anti-European structure...
2364	3	"In the fight led by the Western world against Russia, NATO is one of the pillars of this strange assault. Strange, because behind the rhetoric of the leaders of the EU and certain Eastern countries, whose complexes were perfectly worked out by their new masters, one senses a (very) certain hesitation to move from words to action. If Macron wants “victory for Ukraine”, he stresses that “we must not humiliate Russia”, because then we will have to live in the same world. Even in their current fanaticism, the leaders of European countries cannot envisage the death of the European continent. They still cling to an ""after"", which would be a lightened remake of the ""before"", so nothing irreparable must be committed... or known. Unlike NATO and its American string puller, who sees the European Continent only as a territory and peoples to be kept in the Atlanticist orbit, whatever the price to be paid for this Europe already subjected ."
2364	5	This is indeed the ambiguity of the situation: the war must be won... without being waged. First of all, by having it done, on Ukrainian soil, by the Ukrainian army, by mercenaries, by neo-Nazi groups. In short, by others. But yourself, no, not directly. We provide weapons and advice, we provide the discourse, but we cannot engage directly. Then, by creating an enemy, Russia, which we will not attack directly, because it serves to master space, so it must last.
2364	7	"And it's all the clothing of NATO, which takes the wind. NATO is a military organization, a deterrent organization. However, for deterrence to work, it is not only necessary to have a military capacity, which is frightening, but it is above all necessary that the designated adversary is certain that you will use your forces in the fight. However, as the rhetoric against Russia intensifies, as the figure of the ""Russian"" enemy is constructed, all this Atlanticist agitation seems to be mistaken for a stage, at a show. And this spectacle seems much more intended for Europe, than for Russia. Let's go back in order."
2364	9	"As the conflict unfolds on Ukrainian soil and relations with Russia have fallen into the catacombs of international relations, the United States launches its annual exercises in the Baltic Sea, Operation Baltops 2022. It is obviously nothing more urgent at the moment than increasing the pressure in the Baltic region. Logically, and in reaction to this influx of military ships, Russia is also strengthening its presence and the media can thus headline: ""War in Ukraine: a hundred NATO and Russian ships face to face, the tension rises in the Baltic Sea”. The only link here between Ukraine and the Baltic Sea is NATO, and more specifically the United States, since this is an annual exercise of American naval forces in Europe."
2364	11	"It is therefore because of the unilateral action of NATO, which under cover of the ""Russian threat"" that it provokes precisely by its action, that the international strategic balance is destabilized. The race for the integration of Finland and Sweden is part of the same line. These countries have been collaborating with NATO for a long time, but without being members, due to the neutrality imposed after the Second World War and it was not until 2017 that Finland very discreetly decided to remove the swastika, which proudly adorned its aviation. Russia never reacted. However, with the announcement of the forthcoming entry of these countries into NATO, the reaction was not long in coming - in addition to a reconcentration of Russian forces on the border with Finland, the Russian leaders announced, that the measures would then be adopted according to the concrete threat that these countries will therefore present for national security."
2364	13	The absurdity of the thing is that the threat comes from the one who claims to want to fight against this threat, generates it and then points the finger at the reaction by presenting it as the cause and thus retrospectively justifies his action. But what is NATO's need for this, when we can clearly see this persistent distance between rhetoric and facts? Because ultimately, who would seriously fight and for what (or who)? When you transpose the spectacle into the reality of the weakening of European national armies and national political powers for years, all this posturing looks quite ridiculous...
2364	15	If the preparation for entry into a classic military conflict against Russia is quite unlikely to date, all this cinema is already producing effects... in Europe, which moreover seems to be the real recipient. For years, the EU had taken European countries in hand, reducing their sovereignty to a trickle. But since the acceleration of the Ukrainian conflict in recent months, these seem totally absent. Don't get me wrong: they are present on the media scene, Macron sends weapons to Ukraine and walks around Romania, Boris Johnson is going to pay a visit to kyiv, everyone goes there with their declaration of support for Ukraine. They gesticulate, they talk, they travel... but they don't decide what they do or what they say. They clearly fulfill the role assigned to them in this Atlanticist game, on condition that they can stay in the game. Otherwise, how can we explain this voluntary and collective blindness to neo-Nazism in Ukraine, which they all deny, even more afraid of discrediting themselves in the face of the obvious? Otherwise, how can we explain why these national leaders defend interests that go against the national interest of the countries they lead?
2364	17	"NATO is incapable, as a military structure, of being used to scare Russia. On the other hand, it is essential to hold the European countries in hand politically and it needs their fear in order to exist. Remarkable lines in Le Monde, of uncommon sincerity, ""Finland and Sweden's application for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gives new impetus to the military alliance, to the great displeasure of Russia”. No rational explanation on the merits: how this membership will strengthen international stability. But the focus is on the real purpose of this enlargement operation: to strengthen NATO. We are indeed in a vicious circle, in which NATO raises the rhetoric of Russia's responsibility for all the ills of the Earth and secretly maintains the development of conflicting relations, which it then attributes to it."
2364	19	"How can our rulers remember the words of Zeus in Homer's Odyssey: ""Hear mortals question the gods!"" It is from us, they say, that evils come to them, when they, in truth, by their own stupidity, aggravate the misfortunes assigned by fate. If only European leaders could take the fate of European countries into their own hands, instead of letting them drift into Atlanticist swamps, this conflict would end immediately."
2365	1	From compromise to submission, even the Red Cross got involved!
2365	3	The world is running to ruin, you have to be aware of it. The pythies of the IPCC tell us, relayed by the mainstream media: the end of the world is near. The proof: it's hot in summer, cold in winter, rainy in spring, windy in autumn, the cows fart, the sheep belch, the cicadas crackle, the crickets chirp, the frogs croak and the bobo can't take it anymore. .
2365	5	Fortunately, the state, city officials and major institutions are there to protect us. What would we be without them, their advice so full of benevolent solicitude and their marvelous projects? Nothing. Miserable rags unable to organize our lives in the face of these climatic scourges.
2365	7	Of course, there are sometimes some stubborn people who find it difficult to spit out the dogma on global warming and would like to be able to introduce a few more nuances. Well yes, they say, if we want to explain the vagaries of time, we should also take into account the trees that we uproot, the thousands of hectares that we asphalt, the hedges that have disappeared for decades, the buildings eating away at the space, the earth so impoverished that it turns to dust and no longer retains water… Too complicated. So, we repeat it like a mantra: it's the fault of global warming!
2365	9	And as we were told in May that “the ideal culprit of this nasty stormy weather is obviously climate change” (Le Point du 11/6), we were told in June that the heat wave is also due “ of course”, to global warming. Fortunately, I told you, good souls are watching over us. The French Red Cross, for example, which has just published a visual on Twitter under the #BeatTheHeat, because in English, it is always better, of course. The title: Let's adopt the right #heat wave reflexes: 1 Water, 2 Shadow, 3 Rest.
2365	11	"Until then nothing to say, except that we would have thought of it alone. On the other hand, there is a lot to say about the illustrations… Because the lady who drinks under her veil, even if it is white and she wears a blue dress, is not the Blessed Virgin. She is definitely a lady of ""Muslim culture"", one of those who wears the burkini if, by chance, they are allowed to go to the swimming pool or the beach."
2365	13	"The Red Cross wants to do well, it “creolizes” in the name of humanism and living together. Just like here, where I live, at the café culture which bears the name of the local saint since it is under the leadership of the cathedral and was inaugurated with great fanfare by the bishop. We used to eat fresh salads and omelettes there. The new manager, a jovial black man who comes to us from the Caribbean, now offers kebabs. ""To get in tune with the neighborhood,"" he says, laughing. There is no waitress in hijab yet, but it won't be long. In the name of living together."
2365	15	"Yet it is here that in the name, no doubt, of “living together but without them”, Pope Francis I banned four priests and six deacons from ordination. Too much worn on the cassock, those, perhaps even followers of the ""laces"" which displease this pope so much, who knows. Infamous “tradis” who fill their churches when they are empty elsewhere and do not hesitate to turn into missionaries in a city where we see the multiplication of veiled women. With the blessing of the Red Cross who would like them to hydrate themselves while the males are resting."
2366	1	The big questions we should all ask ourselves when it comes to geopolitics
2366	3	To say that the news is “messy” today would be the height of an understatement. Every day, newspaper headlines present us with a new set of conflicting data that convinces us of a lie that serves someone's interests.
2366	5	No matter how hard we try to keep up with the situation, weeding out the redundant stuff to find the useful information amid the din is a full-time job.
2366	7	Sometimes, though, it's best to take a few steps back, get back to the basics, and remember who the players are, what they want, and then ask each of them the big question... do they succeed?
2366	9	But in order to be able to ask this question, we must honestly ask ourselves the following question:
2366	11	What will they be willing to do to survive in the current circumstances?
2366	13	This is the most uncomfortable question you can ask someone. What would you do to survive? To protect your family? Your position ? The idea you have of yourself?
2366	15	"Everyone has limits to their morality. Everyone. Everyone has a shadow, a dark side, a place where they withdraw into their Hobbesian selves and see the world only in terms of a ""war of all against all"". Anyone who refuses to admit it is someone you should scream away from."
2366	17	"Those who always claim moral superiority, who are always ""the good ones!"" are those who have no limits to their behavior. As the great H.L. Mencken proclaimed almost 70 years ago:"
2366	19	“The urge to save humanity is almost always a pretense, the real urge is to lead. Power is what all messiahs really seek, not the ability to serve. This is true even for godly brethren who take the gospel to foreign lands. »
2366	21	"It is in this context that we must ask this question: ""What will they do?"" ""."
2366	23	Of course, the answer is: “Anything they need”.
2366	25	This is why I never discard anything in my analysis. That's why I'm always ready to skip five or six steps before the big move, because that's the limit of the behavior of the group studied. Today it may be Davos, tomorrow the Fed, the next day Russia.
2366	27	They all have a preferred end state, a solution to their personal equation, with their own combination of input variables. I see it as a set of differential equations to solve. We all want them to boil down to a set of outcomes that will get someone closer to their preferred outcome.
2366	29	And the scary part for all of us should be realizing that not only is there not a single combination where everyone's outcome is maximized, there isn't even a “win/lose” condition.
2366	31	There are only losers, us.
2366	33	Because the first rule of any organization is self-survival. Throw mission statements, corporate speeches and HR virtue signals in the dumpster and set it on fire. At the end of the day, all that matters is survival. Only when this is nearly assured can an organization begin to think beyond its reptilian brain.
2366	35	Like you and me. And at this point, all the major factions have been reduced to this, their horizon is just out of reach, and they're striving to reach it because it's... there, ready!
2366	37	But, like Zeno's paradox, they never reach it because it was never possible to reach it in the first place.
2366	39	"What I fear more than anything, what I see in too many people who analyze the relationship between geopolitics, markets and ideology, is complacency. There's a surprising amount of normalcy bias in the analyst caste, too many 'calm heads will prevail' and not enough 'they all have a plan until they get punched in the face. ""."
2366	41	So when you think of Davos and their stated goals for the Great Reset and rescuing the world from climate change, do you really think there is a limit to their behavior?
2366	43	Do you really believe that they won't start a nuclear war, that they won't unleash a virulent plague, that they won't create a cure worse than the disease, that they won't cause a false flag shooting in a school or that they won't release a Supreme Court opinion?
2366	45	When you think of the Federal Reserve in the context of an unprecedented assault on its autonomy and the commercial banking interests whose protection is its raison d'être, do you really think that today, at this point, wouldn't it cause an economic collapse to save itself from another group (say Davos) that would threaten all of this with destruction?
2366	47	So everyone who pontificates that the Fed will only make one or two rate hikes because that's what the models are saying, because that's what the Fed's past behavior is supposed to say, what will you tell your customers when the Fed makes a fourth hike of 50 basis points. Or that it will accelerate the pace of quantitative tightening to $125 billion a month and allow the US 10-year bond to hit 6%? 8%? 10%?
2366	49	"Are you going to shrug your shoulders and say, ""Um, sorry, it's my fault."""
2366	51	Faced with the prospect of a nuclear-rearmed Ukraine, allied with neoconservative ideologues in Congress and the US State Department committed to a singular vision of hegemony over the planet, would it not be possible that Russia is waging a vicious war of attrition using the artillery tactics of World War II to smash its adversaries, while ominously pledging to eradicate them?
2366	53	What about the highly corrupt, morally immoral congressional leaders on Capitol Hill who have enriched themselves personally and have woven a huge network of bullshit so vast and cumbersome that we can barely follow the details, even surface ?
2366	55	Wouldn't they do anything to prevent their evil from coming to light and being plausibly debunked, knowing that denial is the only thing that matters in D.C.?
2366	57	Today, newly confirmed FOMC Chairman Jerome Powell was summoned by President Biden to the White House to discuss the economy. Biden and the Democrats are scared to death this fall. Biden obviously wants Powell to stop raising rates. Democrats only want to lose 40 House seats in November.
2366	59	That's all the election fraud infrastructure is paying for with George Soros' money.
2366	61	Powell has barely started the tightening cycle and these people, shamelessly, after delaying his confirmation for a year, after abusing their power over the Fed, summon Powell like a dog to the White House and tell him: “Don't hurt our chances this fall. »
2366	63	If I were Powell, I'd smile like the Cheshire Cat before disappearing into the bowels of the Marriner-Eccles building, and consider a 75 basis point hike just for fun.
2366	65	Or he might see his shadow, get scared, and make a deal. But at this point, with whom? With whom do we make an agreement? Bondholders? Davos? Biden? With whom ?
2366	67	Seriously, is this what our politics are reduced to by these venal morons controlled by Davos? Are there still people out there who are thinking a bit?
2366	69	It's been a year since I've been telling you that no one is asking the right questions about what the Fed is willing to do, not just to save itself, but possibly with the much larger goal of breaking people who intentionally break the world for them.
2366	71	Too many people fail to exceed budget or tax revenue figures. Bond markets? The actions ? The Fed couldn't burn it all down, could it? Those who do not want to ask this question seriously are those who keep looking away from the abyss because the abyss looks back at them.
2366	73	They refuse to consider what happens when the game board is so turned upside down, when Jenga's tower is so fragile, that the only winning move is to flick the table and watch it all crumble.
2366	75	The Fed has looked into this chasm before and has always walked away from it, but that was when there was still time. But the Davos has pushed us to the brink of societal collapse across the West, it has refused to even consider that it is the abyss and because of this, the Fed may be faced with the heroic choice to jump and let us pick up the pieces.
2366	77	"The question I have for you is simple: ""What are you prepared to become if this happens?"" ""."
2366	79	We already know what the big players do.
2367	1	Reflections on the chaos of the world and the Western will to annihilate Russia
2367	3	1 Where does evil come from?
2367	5	I am going to dare to use a non-religious definition of evil: evil is the negation of others.
2367	7	Between Russia and the United States, the evil is clearly on the American side. At all times, from the beginning of the European invasion and the genocide of the natives, until today, the United States is the country which has most denied the rights of others to their self-determination. But always in the name of good. The good for them is reduced to the unlimited sharing of their values, that is to say of their interests.
2367	9	With turbo-capitalism, the evil is clearly on that side. They are on a boundless quest to extend their profits at all costs. If the price is the destruction of life on earth, they will prefer that to giving up their privileges, like bankers who throw themselves out of windows on crash days. They would rather die than be ruined. Today, they would rather destroy the planet than be put in a position where they can no longer dominate it. And the first victim will be Russia, followed closely by China.
2367	11	2 Why do Euro-Americans want to destroy Russia?
2367	13	For several reasons.
2367	15	Russia refuses the great reset. That is to say the replacement of material goods by services or immaterial goods. The end goal being that people accept having nothing and being content with their screens. China and Russia refuse this transformation.
2367	16	Russia wants to dedollarize and initiates an autonomous payment system, which eventually, if it works, will put an end to the hegemony of the dollar which allows them to create fictitious money in exchange for products they need , such as energy products, raw materials, food.
2367	17	"Russia is on the fringes of GAFAS services. She has her own services. VK, telegram, rutube, odyssey, rather than Facebook, Google, Twitter, Youtube. This diminishes the field of influence of these entities, which constitute the basis of turbo-capitalism and do not accept their loss of influence which also represents a considerable loss of potential profit. Especially since through censorship and surveillance, they engender more and more distrust, including among the Euro-American populations themselves. The Russian example could extend to other parts of the planet skeptical of the role of ""liberator"" of the United States."
2367	19	The different countries regularly attacked by the United States end up understanding and are gradually putting themselves in a position to resist, through an agreement, which, although not without residual conflicts, is resolved in objective solidarity against the main threat against them, namely the bloc. Euro-American. Because now, European leaders are clearly in the US camp, denying the fatal consequences for their own population. The current war is not the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, limited to Russian-speaking regions including the Donbass, but a major conflict between a turbo-capitalist anti-civilization that has reached the paroxysm of its hubris, represented by the bloc Euro-United States backed by Japan and Australia, and the rest of the world. The conflict is between Westerners accustomed to plundering all others for raw materials, exploiting Asian countries to provide them with the necessary goods at low prices, and offering in exchange military threats, financial demands and intangible products with high added value, accompanied by a moral discourse on the good they represent for humanity.
2367	21	What is at stake is the loss of domination of the planet by the Euro-American bloc and this stake is vital for the USA. As for the European leaders, they are too accustomed to leaning on the boundless desires of their suzerain for them to think for a single second of the needs for peace, democracy and prosperity of their own population, which will eventually have to get used to having nothing and be happy about it, in the happiness of being able to look at their screens with an empty stomach and the heating switched off, if they are not vitrified by a conflict which will put an end to the domination of man over Earth.
2367	23	3 Why it is the socialists who are the most virulent against Russia.
2367	25	We can see this surge almost recurrently. Both in Germany (when Merkel was reluctant), in France (Hidalgo up against Putin), in Finland, when it is precisely the social democrats who want to join NATO, denying the history of their country , and in the USA (Biden more anti-Russian than Trump).
2367	27	Why ?
2367	29	This left is not an anti-capitalist left, quite the contrary, it is a turbo-capitalist left. Closely linked to high tech developments, start-ups, the media, the digital world and the Gafas pharma finance complex.
2367	31	They are very open to minorities, so that an ultra-rich has the right to everything, to be what he wants, whatever his sexuality, his origins, his gender, his religion. His being cannot be criticized for what it is.
2367	33	As for the poor, they are nothing. They are driven out of the big cities, lose their rights to travel, for so-called ecological reasons, lose their rights to health care for economic reasons and represent nothing. Small farmers do not have the right to seed, to promote the right of Monsanto (Bayer) to accumulate profits thanks to the patents made on the existing: this is the model. The poor must pay a tax to enrich the ultra-rich, and since they are nothing, they must disappear if they cannot. It is this turbo-capitalist left that creates laws of confinement that generate the impossibility of surviving.
2367	35	The poor, for this breed, is no longer a victim of the capitalist system, he becomes a nuisance who must be rid of:
2367	37	it pollutes (1)
2367	38	he votes populist
2367	39	he thinks badly
2367	40	he is a conspirator
2367	41	he is racist
2367	42	it generates epidemics
2367	44	The poor become a harmful species which must be quickly rid of; the class struggle changed style, the victims then being the central wealthy classes surrounded by these dangerous classes.
2367	46	Especially since today, unlike yesterday when capitalism needed the poor as a workforce, turbo-capitalism no longer needs them to create its immaterial services with zero or almost zero reproduction costs ( e.g. vaccines and software). So they must go, which is the end goal of the great reset and which both Russia and China oppose.
2367	48	"In the unconscious of these self-proclaimed elites, the Russian can be assimilated to the poor. It is therefore not by chance that it was Ukraine that served as the trigger, a country where many individuals gave their support to Nazism, considering the Russians as ""Untermenschen"", as sub-humans, Nazism which remains still in force in this country, but which can also find echoes in Germany itself via the revival of the anti-Russian war, as if there was revenge for having been defeated by these same ""Untermenschen"", those who belonged fully right to the superior race."
2368	3	Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia
2368	5	"Attempts to ""divert attention"" raise questions about the Pentagon's biological activity, the Russian Foreign Ministry said."
2368	7	"The United States has withheld information about its ""military biological activity"" in post-Soviet states, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova(*) said on Sunday."
2368	9	"According to Zakharova, this raises ""serious questions"" about Washington's compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC)."
2368	11	"In an interview with TASS published on Sunday, Ms Zakharova said that ""the United States prefers to keep silent about the work in progress in the post-Soviet space and does not provide information within the framework of the measures of trust of the BTWC. »"
2368	13	“Claims that the activity of the Pentagon and related structures is focused solely on health issues are false. It is clear that health assistance does not require the involvement of the US military,” Ms Zakharova said.
2368	15	"She added that Washington's claims that it is collecting biomaterial and monitoring the epidemiological situation ""only reinforce and intensify"" Russia's fears about US compliance with the BTWC."
2368	17	Evidence recently released by Moscow regarding the alleged sprawling network of US-funded bio-labs across Ukraine only adds to the suspicions, Zakharova said.
2368	19	In a series of briefings beginning in March, the Russian military presented evidence of Pentagon involvement in funding labs in Ukraine. According to the Russian Investigative Committee, the United States has poured more than $224 million into biological research in Ukraine between 2005 and the beginning of 2022. Western pharmaceutical giants, non-profit organizations and even the American Democratic Party have been involved in this project, says Moscow.
2368	21	The Pentagon has “significantly expanded its research potential, not only in the area of ​​creating biological weapons, but also to obtain information on antibiotic resistance and the presence of antibodies against certain diseases in populations in certain regions. while working in Ukraine, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Force, said in May.
2368	23	Zakharova also pointed out that the United States has not yet withdrawn its reservation to the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of biological and chemical weapons. The United States is among the countries that have said the protocol will cease to be binding on enemy states that fail to abide by the protocol's prohibitions.
2368	25	In this regard, “one can reasonably question the real objectives of the Pentagon’s international military biological activity,” Zakharova said.
2368	27	"Earlier this week, the Pentagon released a “fact sheet on WMD threat reduction efforts with Ukraine, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.” In it, the U.S. military states that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and its partners conducted ""cooperative efforts to reduce legacy threats from nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons left in Successor states of the Soviet Union, including Russia. »"
2368	29	"According to the Pentagon, the United States has ""worked collaboratively to improve Ukraine's biosafety, security, and disease surveillance for both human and animal health,"" supporting ""46 laboratories, peaceful Ukrainian health and disease diagnostic sites over the past two decades”. These programs have focused on “improving public health and agricultural security measures at the heart of nonproliferation. »"
2368	31	"In the same document, the U.S. military accused Russia and China of attempting ""to undermine this work by spreading disinformation and sowing distrust of people and institutions around the world who contribute WMD threat reduction. »"
2368	33	"According to Zakharova, Moscow sees the publication as part of Washington's ""information campaign"" aimed at justifying its military biological activities in the post-Soviet space and ""diverting the attention of the international community from its true orientation"". non-transparent and inappropriate. »"
2369	1	Why India is the champion of the war in Ukraine
2369	3	The NATO-initiated war in Ukraine has far-reaching geopolitical repercussions, with winners and losers lying thousands of miles from the Donbas.
2369	5	"At the South China Morning Post, Alex Lo says the biggest winner is India, which has ""played a masterful balancing act with Russia, the United States and China, reaping significant advantages and benefits while offering few concessions."
2369	7	First, by pursuing a policy of neutrality towards Ukraine, India has reaped enormous economic benefit, paying favorable prices for oil, fertilizers and various other raw materials. The evolution of its oil supply is particularly striking: Since the war, India has gone from nearly zero imported Russian barrels per day to around 800,000.
2369	9	So while other countries are inflicting economic damage on themselves through trade sanctions, India is getting a boost with cheaper fuel. Meanwhile, Russia's oil revenues are even higher than before the war - a situation that recently prompted a pathetic plea from US Special Envoy for Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein.
2369	11	"This week, Hochstein told a Senate subcommittee that he implored Indian officials: ""Don't go overboard, and don't look like you're taking advantage of the pain felt in European homes and in the states."" -United. One can imagine the private laughter of the Indians after the meeting."
2369	13	"Meanwhile, as China has engaged in closer security coordination with Russia, the war in Ukraine could also help ease border tensions between India and China, which have periodically escalated into melee without weapons that lasted for hours. The Chinese ""dare not increase the border pressure to antagonize the Indians at this time,"" Lo writes."
2369	15	Lo provides important historical context to illuminate India's neutrality over Ukraine:
2369	17	“Many Indians are much more critical of US and NATO expansion, which they see as the underlying cause of the war in Ukraine. They are historically sympathetic towards Russia, remembering that the Soviets sided with New Delhi throughout the 1950s, at a time when Western powers backed Islamabad. And Russia, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, remained a reliable arms supplier. »
2369	19	"Eager to prevent India from sliding firmly into Russian security orbit, the US government is creeping towards New Delhi with new arms deals. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria ""Yats is the guy"" Nuland visited India in March. Summarizing his discussions, Nuland said:"
2369	21	“In addition to historical ties, India’s reliance on Russia for defense supplies is crucial. In particular, we talked about the legacy of security support from the Soviet Union and Russia at a time when the United States was less generous with India. Today, of course, times have changed and we are very keen to do more and more in the field of defense with India. »
2369	23	Which shows that India has a formidable rival for the title of “biggest winner” of the war in Ukraine: the American military-industrial complex.
237	1	Putin against the West: two opposing universes
237	3	Vladimir Putin thought he could swallow Ukraine in a few days, but the war has been going on for more than three months. It won't be over for a long time. Because it is now the entire West that supports Ukraine. Independent Ukraine wanted to become free, to establish a democracy. No question for the despot who reigns in Moscow. The freedom of peoples is for him the supreme danger, the enemy to be eliminated by all means.
237	5	The surprise is big for most Western citizens and even for many political scientists. They contemplated the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, but did not believe that it would take place. Why ? Because Western rationality forbade it. There is nothing to gain, they thought, by going to war against Ukraine and everything to lose: image of aggressor and now of war criminal, economic recession, diplomatic isolation.
237	7	But there ! Tyrants do not have the rationality of democrats. Power alone counts for them and it seems unbearable to them to be challenged by ordinary citizens claiming freedom. That would be the only thing missing! The leader commands and the others obey. This is the image that Putin gives when he addresses Russian ministers or generals. And as some of these meetings are broadcast by the international media, it is obvious that the master of the Kremlin wishes to broadcast a self-portrait of a tyrant that makes his collaborators tremble.
237	9	The former KGB officer, trained by the communists, probably has no idea of ​​the completely negative character in the West of this representation of himself. Seen from here, he appears as a dangerous individual, a liar, violent, a real foil. But for many Russians who have never known democracy, Putin simply behaves as a leader, which explains the dissemination of such negative images. Going from Tsar of All Russia to Communist rulers, the Russian people have never known anything but autocracy and they remain receptive to it. The conditioning to passive obedience to an individual seen as a leader and guide, charting the course of the future, does not miraculously disappear. This requires an education in freedom, teaching from childhood must favor individual autonomy and then a critical approach. Within families, everyone's freedom of expression must be allowed.
237	11	Westerners know how much this freedom requires open-mindedness and even empathy. To understand an opponent, one must be able to take into consideration not only his reasoning but also his sensitivity. The current rise of populism in the West makes it possible to appreciate the fragility of such an edifice. But it is from this fragile idealism that democracy derives its greatness.
2370	1	The Minsk Accords, which Minsk Accords?
2370	3	I have to talk to you again about the Minsk Accords. Many justify the invasion of Ukraine by the non-respect of the Minsk agreements. They are wrong and I explain why.
2370	5	There have been two Minsk agreements. Minsk 1 and Minsk 2. I have published a comprehensive report to explain these two Accords. The former has been violated by both Ukraine and Russia, and it would be dishonest to blame Ukraine, and not Russia, for justifying Russia's invasion.
2370	7	The failure of Minsk 1 led President Hollande and Angela Merkel to draft the second Accord. An agreement drafted by incapable, corrupt and stupid people. I explain why in my report.
2370	9	As for the second Agreement, Minsk 2, well Russia is not in this agreement! Intellectually, therefore, it is not possible to justify the invasion of Ukraine as Russia's response to the fact that it violated these agreements - since Russia did not sign them! It took part, as did France and Germany. Russia cannot say to the Ukrainians: “you have not respected this agreement that you have signed with x and y, so I declare war on you”! Russia does not guarantee compliance with the agreements. She also clearly recalled this, when she was criticized for continuing to arm the rebels after the signing of Minsk 2 which had negotiated their disarmament: Russia said that it was not a signatory of the Accords, and that So we couldn't tell her that she was committed to disarming the separatists.
2370	11	Why ? Because they decided that Russia had the right to invade Ukraine because they have a fondness for Putin, and then they looked for something to justify this invasion, because if they didn't side of morality, they would experience a feeling of guilt.
2370	13	So everything goes:
2370	15	Minsk (which does not apply),
2370	16	"the ""15,000 massacred by Ukraine in the Donbas"" (which are not 15,000 but probably 2,500, and the UN has accused Russia and Ukraine of war crimes),"
2370	17	the Nazis of Azov (which is a myth that I have largely debunked - I have shown that there are more Nazis in Russia than anywhere in the world - and that Nazis are fighting in the Russian army , like the Chechen Islamists).
2370	19	If the supporters of the invasion evoke the Minsk Accords, you will have noticed that none of them evoke those of Budapest. Why ? Because they disturb. What do these 1991 Accords say? That Ukraine, which has just declared its independence, and finds itself with nuclear installations on its soil inherited from the communist era, undertakes to get rid of this nuclear power, in exchange for which Russia and the United States United pledge never to invade Ukraine.
2370	21	Ukraine got rid of its nuclear power. Russia violated the agreement and invaded Ukraine.
2370	23	Posted by Jean-Patrick Grumberg on June 12, 2022
2370	24	The Minsk Accords, which Minsk Accords?
2370	26	Preamble: I am neither a supporter of Ukraine nor a supporter of Russia, I am reporting to you the facts that survive the test of propaganda*. I know that the facts that some of you do not want to read bother you. I can't give up publishing them for fun. Journalism is not about making people happy. On the other hand, I have no reason to have animosity against those who support the invasion, and I do not. I think they are wrong, they take wrong information because they like it, but it does not bother me more than that. It's not like for Israel or the United States, two countries that matter to me, and for which, if I accept without difficulty that they are not liked, I fight relentlessly so that it does not happen. on the basis of lies and false information propagated by the media which vomits them.
2370	27	I have to talk to you again about the Minsk Accords. Many justify the invasion of Ukraine by the non-respect of the Minsk agreements. They are wrong and I explain why.
2370	30	There have been two Minsk agreements. Minsk 1 and Minsk 2. I have published a comprehensive report to explain these two Accords. The former has been violated by both Ukraine and Russia, and it would be dishonest to blame Ukraine, and not Russia, for justifying Russia's invasion.

2370	42	Yes, Minsk is a false argument held by the Putinists.
2370	44	Why ? Because they decided that Russia had the right to invade Ukraine because they have a fondness for Putin, and then they looked for something to justify this invasion, because if they didn't side of morality, they would experience a feeling of guilt.
2370	46	So everything goes:
2370	48	Minsk (which does not apply),
2370	49	"the ""15,000 massacred by Ukraine in the Donbas"" (which are not 15,000 but probably 2,500, and the UN has accused Russia and Ukraine of war crimes),"

2370	54	Ukraine got rid of its nuclear power. Russia violated the agreement and invaded Ukraine.
2370	56	Why don't the pro-Russians talk about it? Because it contradicts what they have decided to believe. Because they only read what they want to read, i.e. pro-Russian information, and the pro-Russian media does not talk about the Budapest memorandum.
2371	1	Coronavirus: Bolsonaro threatens to leave WHO in turn
2371	3	Like his American counterpart Donald Trump, the Brazilian president accuses the institution of “ideological bias”.
2371	5	"Mistrust around the WHO is growing. A week ago, Donald Trump announced that the United States was officially ending its relationship with the World Health Organization, after temporarily suspending its funding. This Saturday, June 6, it is Jair Bolsonaro who in turn threatens to leave the institution, reports franceinfo in particular. Like his American counterpart Donald Trump, the Brazilian president accuses the WHO of ""ideological bias"". Both men have long been critical of the agency's mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, and its leniency with China."
2371	6	“Chloroquine is back”
2371	8	"“I tell you here, the United States left the WHO, we are thinking about it in the future,” Jair Bolsonaro told the press. “Either the WHO works without ideological bias, or we leave it too. We don't need people from outside to give their feelings about health here, ”he also judged. A great defender of hydroxychloroquine, like Donald Trump, the Brazilian president was hardly surprised that a study in the medical journal The Lancet, which concluded that the treatment was useless, was strongly questioned and then withdrawn. Nor that the WHO, which had asked for all clinical trials on the molecule to be stopped, has restarted research. ""Trump took the money away from them and they went back on everything,"" said Jair Bolsonaro, welcoming that ""chloroquine [is] back""."
2371	10	Despite the fact that Brazil has become the third country in the world most affected by the coronavirus, with 35,026 deaths and more than 645,000 cases, the head of state continues to ask for a rapid lifting of the isolation measures, affirming that the economic cost of the epidemic is greater than the health risks. The WHO regularly lectures Brazil on this subject, warning them against lifting containment measures before the epidemic is at least contained.
2372	1	After receiving nuclear weapons, Ukraine will disappear along with Poland and all of Europe
2372	3	"Former Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has called for ""giving"" Ukraine nuclear weapons. In his view, Ukraine renounced nuclear weapons in response to the security guarantees of the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which Russia allegedly did not respect. “NATO therefore has the right to give Ukraine nuclear warheads so that it can defend its independence. »"
2372	5	"Sikorsky does not see it, that article 1 of said their memorandum sets out the principles of the Final Act of the CSCE, which was destroyed by the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia in 1999: ""the Russian Federation , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America confirm Ukraine's commitment in accordance with the principles of the Final Act to respect the independence, sovereignty and borders of the Ukrainian”."
2372	7	"The final act did not prevent the North Atlantic Military Alliance from attacking Yugoslavia. As a result, the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations was destroyed. By attacking Yugoslavia, the collective West began to radically ""reformat"" the needs of globalization the whole Old World. Russia cannot ignore these changes."
2372	9	The desires of Sikorsky, who has long suffered from Russophobia, are clear. Even during his work as a correspondent for Western publications, he took part in hostilities against Soviet troops in Afghanistan, for which he received the nickname Mujahideen. He actively supported Maidan 2013-2014 in Kyiv. He studied in the UK, he is considered to be closely linked to the UIS. And now, in all likelihood, behind his resounding statement are the Anglo-Saxons.
2372	11	The consequences of the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to the Zelensky regime are not the first month to foam among Western politicians. From their point of view, the use of the atomic bomb by Ukraine could qualitatively improve the situation of the Ukrainian armed forces and lead to a turning point in the military conflict. Fears of retaliation from Russia and the expansion of nuclear war are also showing.
2372	13	"In order to study Moscow's reaction to such a measure, ""leaked information"" that the Pentagon secretly sent two tactical charges to kyiv has already been cleared to the United States."
2372	15	The buzz around the “nuclear issue” testifies to an attempt to create a virtual reality that could then be translated into reality. However, despite Zelensky's agreement to give his country under the control of Poland, the people of Western Ukraine do not express enthusiasm about it. Polish troops have not yet entered the Lviv region for “peacekeeping purposes”, and what the Poles “zolnezhi” did to the local population decades ago is already remembered.
2372	17	In the period when Galicia and Volhyn’ belonged to Poland in 1920-1945.here the most brutal police terror spread. Here, the Ukrainian nationalist movement UN / ARU *, which unleashed a genocide against the Poles, strengthened and rose. Warsaw's response to the Unovites was ruthless.
2372	19	After the end of the Second World War, Poland proceeded to ethnic cleansing received by the territories and deported Ukrainians from their region of origin by force. All this remained in the memory of the people, and unlike Zelensky, the population of the old “kres” did not burn with the desire to go “under Poland”. After the appearance of new old owners, the situation will be even more tense. And if Warsaw intends to maintain the Ukrainian ruling regime, it would be more far-sighted for her to determine whether such a regime armed with an atomic bomb (according to Sikorsky) would be beneficial for her? Judging by what was born out of the Ukrainian political swamp, in kyiv, it is likely that the emergence of an even more aggressive regime, ready for any adventure. Such power, mini nuclear charges will come in handy. This regime will not dare to use them against Russia (the answer is obvious), and the return of Western lands with the help of a nuclear bomb may seem attractive.
2372	21	Sikorsky would also be useful to remember Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that Russia will not allow atomic weapons to be transferred to the kyiv regime. These statements mean a lot.
2372	23	"What will be the consequences for Warsaw if it plays with Sikorski's painful idea? The answer was given by Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin: ""the statement of the former head of the Polish Foreign Ministry, and now MEP Radoslav Sikorsky, that the West has the right to 'give of nuclear weapons to Ukraine, can provoke a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe. He does not think about the future of either Ukraine or Poland. In the case of the implementation of its proposals, these countries will not, however, be like Europe”."
2372	25	"According to Volodin, the former Polish minister must ""be examined by a psychiatrist, pass a mandate and stay at home under supervision""."
2373	1	Catastrophe and Panicanicle
2373	3	For three days, France was hot. A few days before summer, summer temperatures have thus hit head-on a country absolutely unprepared for a rise in temperatures: while, for thirty years, all the politicians have been telling us that the climate will warm up, the State and his government managed to show that they were once again caught off guard.
2373	5	"Thus, with a discreet but undeniable modification of the color scales of the weather maps, catastrophism can impose itself without difficulty. The flat areas of crimson red are formal, and if we quickly forget that ""♩ When it's hot, it's not ♪ the weather!"" ♫ When it's cold, it's not the climate! ♬"", there remains an insurmountable observation: the temperatures have risen too much, the climate refuses to remain well regulated as it should, and this heat will inevitably cause problems that the State and its henchmen will hasten to solve!"
2373	7	This is probably why in Gironde, it was decided to cancel public outdoor events: people who get together and spend a little time in the sun, this is the guaranteed recipe for possible slippages that could turn fun, pleasure or something that needs to be suppressed anyway. Worse: some could catch sunstroke, which would not fail to clog already overwhelmed hospital services.
2373	9	That these services are understaffed does not seem to worry any manager. That this lack of staff is directly and indirectly caused by the growing disorganization of the French public hospital as well as the vaccination obligations and the suspensions of refractory caregivers does not provoke any reaction from politicians.
2373	11	On the other hand, and in line with the closure of ski slopes last winter on the grounds that any winter sports injuries could be added to the already too numerous covid packs, we are once again witnessing the use of a public health reason to suspend some of the fundamental and once inalienable freedoms of French citizens: gathering, demonstrating or taking part in festivities is now entirely subject to political goodwill, which can prohibit it in order not to any reason.
2373	13	In the same way and in a wave of worrying fragility for the future, we come to have classrooms closed: the children would be at risk, the establishments are not designed for these temperatures, the teachers either, and then it's too hot to work anyway.
2373	15	Siesta and idleness for everyone! At least, by doing absolutely nothing, there is no risk of injury! Remember that there are even more fragile than schoolchildren or Girondin festival-goers in full sun, starting with the hospital emergency services managed by our elites.
2373	17	It is therefore no surprise that we see the inevitable toll-free number appear, reactivated by the government, a now systematic response to all problems of any kind. We are feverishly awaiting the Grenelle of the Heatwave or the Drought, the next stage just as inevitable if – unfortunately, necessarily anthropogenic – a new wave were to whip France again in the coming weeks.
2373	19	In short, as soon as the temperatures rise, panic sets in in the country and new draconian state interventions multiply. In a very enlightening way, we already have a feeling that when the temperatures drop next fall, the same will happen: the State, ultra-unprepared at all to see that it can sometimes be cold in winter, will shake all his factotums to explain to us how to warm ourselves up and why going out is dangerous (we catch viruses and the ground can be slippery).
2373	21	It will therefore be advisable to stay at home and... to put on a mask to protect yourself from one or the other pulmonary pestilence of the moment. This is not an exaggeration: the German authorities are already on the go and are considering (in the middle of the dodger) that the obligation to wear a mask could return seasonally in order to stem various respiratory infections.
2373	23	In fact, heat wave, coronavirus, flu or gastroenteritis, all excuses are good, especially if they are sanitary, so that prohibitions and governmental obligations are put in place to guarantee that we pretend to take care of your health and safety.
2373	25	It does not matter here that these actions are in the medium and long term directly detrimental to your health and your safety: it is absolutely necessary to gesticulate and reduce your freedoms to prevent you from taking the risk of living, this intrinsically meaning the risk, too seditious, of you state pass.
2373	27	The health excuse then becomes the gateway to all liberticidal delusions: too hot, too cold, too windy, your rights to gather, to move, to demonstrate disappear. Too cool, too wet, too this or too that? You will have to wear masks, you will have to be pecked with one or another miraculous potion from an industry that seems to be freeing itself more and more quickly from all the precautions that are nevertheless essential to guarantee that we do not do more harm than good.
2373	29	The important thing is that you carry no risk to others, to the collective, this ill-defined mass but so practical for budding tyrants.
2373	31	Since then, individual responsibility has been abolished: you no longer have the right to take risks for yourself since, thanks to the magic of the collectivization of health, you could cost others dearly. Risk being prohibited, responsibility is abolished. Citizens are nothing more than herds of children, unaccompanied minors that only financial solvency saves from total confinement (and for how long?).
2373	33	Obviously, the servitude highway starts from the public hospital.
2373	35	And thanks to the fierce will of a small, active, vocal minority who crave these silly and harmful policies, these curtailments of freedom never go away when the events that prompted them come to an end. The country thus remains stuck in a state of emergency (terrorist, health), and only violent crowd movements, when politicians feel their own rind at stake, make it possible to envisage the retreat of the ruthless state crushing.
2373	37	However, since there are no longer any of these movements, this country is screwed.
2375	1	Managing the Covid crisis: governing by fear
2375	3	It's almost Christmas. But this year, after several decades, even a few centuries of long tradition, Western welfare states have decided to change their costumes. Rather than putting on the long red and white coat, sporting the white beard and the generous overweight, the distributors of gifts paid with the money of others have this year decided to transform themselves into Father Fouettard.
2375	5	Holy coronavirus!
2375	7	And sacred citizens! Never able to follow the instructions given to them. It's not that complicated though, is it?
2375	9	Winter is coming. Winter is here. The fifth wave is looming. It will overwhelm us all. Chaos will invade the hospitals. The measures taken are no longer sufficient. They need to be strengthened. Care must be taken to ensure that they are respected.
2375	11	Hammer, repeat, threaten, shout!
2375	13	The Germans will be “vaccinated, cured or dead” at the end of winter!
2375	15	The French show relaxation at work: that's enough!
2375	17	The incidence rate explodes among 6-10 year olds: it's serious, very serious!
2375	19	The fifth wave is dazzling: it is worrying, very worrying! Of course, it's going to end badly!
2375	21	It's not good not to respect the barrier gestures! It is not good not to be vaccinated: it is bad and you will be punished!
2375	24	Fear everywhere, reason nowhere
2375	26	No more whatever it takes and other sprinklings of magic money that suited everyone. Now we stop laughing: we move on to serious things! Defense advice, masks, vaccine… containment is “no longer to be ruled out”…
2375	28	Two years of being ruled by fear and infantilization. Two years of being ruled by apprentice doctors with obscure agendas and self-declared scholarly epidemiologists. Two years of being ruled by totally panicked people running around like headless chickens.
2375	30	A shot in the air and all the rabbits rush to their burrow.
2375	32	Ah, how much we miss this blessed time when the calm, when the height of adrenaline, was just before the TV appearance for the announcement of a scoop without any impact but which was going to make people talk about her (and self) for days!
2375	34	But there, for two years, it's Verdun, it's the bayonet trench, it's the fort of Douaumont; our leaders face a gigantic and historic danger; realize: if you go out in the street without taking precautions, you risk catching a cold!
2375	37	life is dangerous
2375	39	Because for almost the entire population, the respiratory infection that circulates freely for those who stubbornly refuse to confine themselves and stay behind barriers, is between a small cold and a good flu.
2375	41	Ok, for some others it can be serious, even extremely serious. But getting hit by a speeder at a crossroads or overturning your fryer on yourself is also very, very serious.
2375	43	Agreed, you will say, but the State also takes care of road safety and domestic accidents. There is only one thing to admit, and without hesitation: it's true, the state takes care of everything!
2375	45	He takes care of everything and makes statistics. Then he creates experts who select the causes. Then he makes a plan, goes on TV and gets applause. Finally, the taxpayer goes to the cash register and a whole junta of qualified parasites manages his little hoards of public money with one and only goal: to ensure that they never decrease.
2375	47	When we want, we put the means!
2375	50	The truth is the truth
2375	52	This whole business of building scaffolding of public deficits was well-established, well-organized. To pass the pill, from kindergarten on, citizens were conditioned to worship the benefits of the nanny state. The state, which has long since taken over control of education from an early age, in order to properly control formatting.
2375	54	From the age of 3, each citizen therefore received the immense privilege of being able to benefit from a free and quality education, the first introduction to a social system that “the whole world envies us”.
2375	56	Above all, we were going to prevent future taxpayers from being contaminated by all these mental illnesses which call into question the divine omnipotence and the immeasurable generosity of the State: critical thinking, tolerance, doubt, curiosity, humility...
2375	58	Science is truth. The government relies on science to make these decisions. The government is always right. End of the discussion.
2375	61	The grain of sand in the shoe
2375	63	But for two years, there is a problem. It's the war. For two years, the state, the politicians, the senior civil servants have invented a war against an invisible enemy. For two years, all this pretty little world is literally dying of fear. Contrary to what one may feel: they do not govern by fear, it is fear that governs them.
2375	65	Sacred virus, which never wants to do what is expected of it, which does not want to confine itself, which does not want to be vaccinated, which does not want to stay behind the barriers... But why?
2375	67	Some have taken on the dimension of this fear that governs those who are supposed to govern us. Some have understood that it was necessary to stop being afraid of a government which was systematically weak with the strong and believed to hide it by proclaiming itself strong with the weak.
2375	69	A short week of general strike... and the obligation of compulsory vaccination with messenger RNA vaccines for caregivers was dumped in Guadeloupe. The nurses and caregivers who found themselves on the street in mainland France, without even having access to the RSA, are green with rage. A few days later, the general strike spread to Martinique, and now to Tahiti…
2375	72	The end of marshals and grand chancellors
2375	74	Who is to blame for this flagrant lack of courage, accompanied by an uninhibited versatility and a congenital bad faith that we seem to find in all Western governments and which is reaching new heights in France?
2375	76	Undoubtedly, no one. Welfare states, the legacy left by great soldiers and great diplomats who wanted to strengthen the power of their country, no longer have their place in a world without borders and without wars.
2375	78	But this is the world that people want, hence their lack of interest in politics. Hence the increasingly blatant mediocrity and lack of courage among those who choose by ego or by default to run for public office.
2375	80	When you are a visionary, when you aspire to great things, when you want to help others, when you believe in a destiny for humanity, you set up a startup and become a billionaire, not a civil servant.
2376	1	CNN: Johnson's actions will turn Britain into a 'pariah' on the world stage
2376	3	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's short-sighted political decisions, along with his vociferous bickering with top international institutions, risk soon turning the UK into a pariah on the world stage, the channel's correspondents have concluded. American CNN.
2376	5	Another major scandal erupts around Johnson, caused by the obstinate intention of the British authorities to deport migrants to Rwanda: at the same time, according to the decision of the European court of human rights, the theft of a plane to this country is prohibited. However, despite protests from key international institutions, the British Prime Minister clearly has no intention of stepping down – he will instead begin crafting a bill capable of enabling Britain to completely ignore both the order of the United Nations human rights office and the decision of the same European Court.
2376	7	Scandalous, according to journalists, the antics of the British Prime Minister in the form of bitter disputes with the European Union and the battle with the European Court of Human Rights, will soon lead to the complete international isolation of the United Kingdom .
2376	9	It should be noted, recently, Boris Johnson with enviable regularity finds himself at the epicenter of high-profile scandals: his personal ranking, and, at the same time, the ranking of the Conservative party rapidly collapsed. In addition, according to the Daily Mail, last month the British Prime Minister took the last honorable place in the ranking of confidence in the ministers who are part of the current government of the Kingdom. According to many British sociological polls, such a sharp drop in Johnson's level of support will inevitably lead to the Tories' biggest defeat in the next vote in Parliament.
2376	11	By the way, at the end of the local electoral process, the British Conservative party has already succeeded in triumphantly losing control of three important councils, in particular, after suffering a crushing defeat in the council of the Central District of Westminster: it, let us recall- the, is a large part of the government institutions, including the ministries of defense and finance, thus As indicated, the control of this party council succeeded from the distant 1964.
2376	13	Recall that Boris Johnson traveled to kyiv after the three European leaders, where he had talks with President Zelensky. The visit of the British Prime Minister has also not been officially announced.
2376	15	As Bloomberg has previously noted, Britain, which immediately and enthusiastically began supplying arms to Ukraine, is deliberately preventing diplomatic channels from resolving the confrontation between “nezalezhnaya” [independent Ukraine] and Russia , which is largely driven by the personal ambitions of Britain's political elites. The complex Ukrainian situation, columnists say, is the only opportunity for Johnson, who is rapidly losing ratings, who has become a high-level participant in a series of scandals, to emerge from major political difficulties, saving his own reputation.
2376	17	"In addition, the ""degraded policy of the United Kingdom"", according to the journalists, can cause a lot of damage to peace and diplomacy in general."
2378	1	Moldova will pay dearly to join sanctions against the Russian Federation – expert Shor
2378	3	Blindly following the anti-Russian agenda, it is Moldova, which may soon be left without basic benefits — it awaits hunger, cold, poverty — Moldova's political opposition leader Ilan Shor, whose statement appeared on Telegram, shared his grim predictions.
2378	4	Moldova will pay dearly to join sanctions against the Russian Federation - expert Shor
2378	6	The government's short-sighted policy, he said, can cost the country dearly. In the case of the Sanctions War, the authorities will not be able to provide their own population with basic necessities, because the coming cold weather will bring an aggravation of the socio-economic problems linked to the energy and food crisis.
2378	8	Party leader Shor says obtaining Moldova's candidate status for EU membership was nothing but a contractual measure for entry into the society of Western countries to impose economic restrictions on Russia. According to the politician, such an agreement is destructive and is practically aimed at the destruction of the people of Moldova.
2378	10	“Remaining in the status of candidate for membership of the European Union promises long years of waiting. Moreover, support for anti-Russian sanctions will immediately hit Moldova itself. Any action should be logical and justified, aimed at obtaining benefits. Moreover, this situation will mark the rejection of the status of neutrality enshrined in the Constitution”, – warns the leader of the opposition.
2378	12	According to Shor, on any form of interaction with a reliable partner — Russia — it will be possible to put a cross, and count on the help of a strong state will no longer have.
2378	14	The consequences will be particularly negative for ordinary citizens of Moldova. Shor warned that he was organizing peaceful protests to defend the people's right to a stable life.
2378	16	“With the support of anti-Russian sanctions, we will dig ourselves a hole, and then — transfer all the blame to Russia. < … > It is impossible to dance under the breath of the West, because the basis of politics must be the needs of the people, which we politicians are called upon to support and protect,” — he said he commented on the situation.
238	3	"With his agenda stalled, inflation spiraling out of control, and most Americans refusing to believe the White House rhetoric that it's all Putin's fault, President Joe Biden lashed out now to the so-called ""MAGA program"" (Make America Great Again)."
238	5	"In remarks he made Wednesday ahead of the Fed's rate decision, Biden suggested that the Republican Party's proposals are largely in line with Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" philosophy, which advocates a cut taxes, “America first” trade policies and border security."
238	7	"During his speech, Biden sought to distance his own economic agenda from Mr. Trump's, saying, ""It's a MAGA agenda. Meanwhile, millionaires, billionaires and corporations get away with it,” referring to a proposal by Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Republican Party’s campaign organization in the Senate."
238	9	“Imagine that. Just imagine that. I think that's really outrageous,” Biden continued, adding, “It's extreme, like most MAGA things are. »
238	11	“Looking forward, I have a plan to cut the deficit even further, which will help reduce inflationary pressures and lower costs for everyone,” Biden said, citing elements of the “Build Back Better” of his party, which has stalled and was rejected by Democratic Senators Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ).
238	13	With inflation on everyone's mind ahead of the Fed meeting, Biden clung to his promise to cut the deficit, which Mr. Manchin and other moderate Democrats support, while blaming the invasion of the Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin to be responsible for soaring grocery bills and pain at the pump.
238	15	According to Biden, he can reduce the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion this year. At the same time, he is asking Congress for $33 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, on top of the $22.5 billion he had already requested.
2380	3	“If the left blocked like the right, Marine Le Pen would be President. This is the sentence that sums up the political sequence of this year 2022. What did we not hear the macronists between the two rounds of the presidential election lecturing anyone who wants to hear it? At the time, the left shared with them “common values”, those of the Republic and democracy, noble values ​​that they had to defend against the danger represented by Marine Le Pen. The leftist electorate was not mistaken. Even though the dam is getting thinner and thinner, from election to election, it has not yet yielded and Emmanuel Macron has been re-elected.
2380	5	Two months later, welcome to the new world. After having suddenly led a legislative campaign against the left – going so far as to call members of the PS “extreme left anarchists”, pushing the demonization of the RN a little further – Macronie is afraid. Fear of the NUPES which weighs more than 30% of the votes. Fear of facing real opposition for a whole five-year term. So, for lack of anything better, the macronists are turning to the alternative: the far right. See for yourself…
2380	7	Barbara Pompili, LREM MP and former Minister for Ecological Transition, also evokes the possibility of “discussing” with the far right.
2380	9	The far right is so normalized in French political life that Macronie, the right as a whole, does not intend to do anything to fight against it. Because in fact, having the RN as an opponent is less cumbersome than having the NUPES. Or, as Antoine Rondel, journalist at Libé, tweets: “If we had to remember that the RN has never represented the slightest threat to the preservation of the interests of capital, we are served”.
2381	1	No, veganism won't save the world, but it could wear your health out
2381	3	Beforehand and in order to dissipate any potential misunderstanding, a few reminders. Whether we are radical ecologists, naturists, decrementists, Luddites, etc., we are all opposed to factory farming and its abominable treatment of animals, but also, more generally, to industrial capitalism.
2381	5	From an ecocentric perspective, that is to say from a perspective that considers that what is essential is the health of the ecosphere, the prosperity of the planetary biotic community and the communities that compose it (and of which the human being is a part ) — who considers, with Aldo Leopold, that “a thing is good when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community, and bad in the opposite case” — this goes without saying.
2381	7	But here there is already a divergence between veganism and the ecocentric perspective that we defend, for example, at Deep Green Resistance.
2381	9	Veganism aims “to combat speciesism in all its forms by opposing discrimination and violence against animals (slavery and commodification by the human institution). This refusal is expressed on a daily basis, as much as possible, by a food choice and a vegan lifestyle. » (Vegan-France)
2381	11	"Another definition of veganism, formulated by the Vegan Society in 1979, describes it as: ""A philosophy and way of life which seeks to exclude — so far as possible — all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals, whether either for food, clothing, or for any other purpose, and by extension, to promote the development and use of alternatives without animal exploitation, for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment [… ]. »"
2381	13	What we notice is that veganism is in no way opposed to capitalism or industrialism, to the human exploitation on which they are structurally based. It is not based on an acknowledgment of the intrinsic social harm and unsustainability of capitalism, of industrialization and of civilization more generally — the industrial exploitation and breeding of the human animal does not seem too worry. The (modern) history of veganism, and in particular of the British Vegan Society, is not one of opposition to the domination or oppression that constitutes capitalism and, more generally, civilization. Today, some vegans do not hesitate to affirm that “liberalism and capitalism” are the “allies of the animal cause”.
2381	15	& therefore: I. Veganism, in itself, is not ecological
2381	17	Most often, veganism is defined simply as a mode of consumption in industrial capitalism. According to L214: “A vegan person is a person like the others. She simply chose to change her way of consuming and acting, so as to have the lowest possible negative impact on others. She frequents circuses without animals, observes animals in the wild without hunting them, enjoys 100% plant-based fashion, chooses materials not derived from the exploitation of animals for clothing (cotton, synthetic materials, etc.) and uses products untested cosmetics and maintenance. »
2381	19	However, consuming foodstuffs and other goods from industrial capitalism – but stamped vegan – is not ecological. A lesser evil? Sometimes, no doubt, in comparison with the consumption of even more harmful commodities. But not necessarily. It all depends on the benchmarks you use.
2381	21	Be that as it may, within the framework of a social system (industrial capitalism) totally unsustainable from an ecological point of view and based on growth, the efforts of consumption which, considered in isolation, can pass for lesser evils, are ultimately turn out to be insignificant. A vegan industrial civilization could very well finish polluting and ravaging the world.
2381	23	According to Fortune Business Insights company estimates, “The global vegan food market size was valued at USD 23.31 billion in 2020. The market is expected to grow from USD 26.16 billion in 2021 to USD 61.35 billion by 2020. by 2028, posting a CAGR of 12.95% over the forecast period. »
2381	25	An industrial sector among others in globalized capitalism.
2382	1	Presidents change, the American empire remains
2382	3	"Addressing several hundred thousand Germans, Democratic candidate Barack Obama presented the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as ""the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security"". Republican John McCain wants the latter to become more involved in the conflict that has broken out in Georgia. Despite their differences, the same conception of the place of the United States in the world unites the two main parties."
2382	5	"Shooting red bullets at President George W. Bush, a ""lame duck"" now, is definitely out of fashion. The new hot sport is to speculate on how Mr. John McCain or Mr. Barack Obama will redesign American foreign policy. However, this exercise is not more productive."
2382	7	Caligula, third emperor of Rome, was a cruel despot. It is said, however, that he toyed with an idea – indicative of the little respect his public figure inspired in him: appointing his favorite horse, Incitatus, first to the Senate and then to a post of consul. Perhaps Caligula was implying that the mechanics of the Roman Empire worked on their own and, once launched, could free themselves from their cohort of Caesars.
2382	9	Today, with the United States at an impasse in Iraq and ticking time bombs smoldering in the Greater Middle East and the Caucasus, the problem lies less with the disastrous mediocrity of Mr. Bush, or in the imperial ardor of the next American president, than in the will of an empire born of the war against Spain (1898) and ordering a pax americana after the second war world.
2382	11	The United States survived the Vietnamese adventure; they can emerge from the Iraqi fiasco virtually unscathed. Momentarily disconcerted, the empire will continue on its way, between bipartisanship, pressure from business circles and evangelical blessings. This ability to afford costly blunders – not for the elites but for the working classes – characterizes the imperial states that have reached maturity. The American empire will certainly crumble eventually, but predictions of precipitous decline are overblown. Without a military rival to their measure, the United States will remain, for some time to come, the only world superpower.
2382	13	However, by dint of fighting against erosion, vain and overly expansionist empires undermine their power and prestige. Their nervousness increases. And their ferocity. We then see them stamping their feet to remind the world that they are not paper tigers. Given its posture in Iraq and the fallout from this crisis in the region, will the United States opt for an escalation in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia, Georgia, in Venezuela? The views of Messrs. McCain and Obama differ on where to intervene, what tactics to use. But neither doubts the urgency or legitimacy of such action. The first situates the front line of the “war against terrorism” in Iraq; the second in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
2382	15	"The United States has the strongest military in the world. It surpasses by far all those of the ancient empires. Omnipresent on the seas, in the air, in space and cyberspace, Washington knows how to project its force at record speed over considerable distances. Thus, like a self-proclaimed sheriff, he rushes from one end of the planet to the other to master or exploit crises, real or putative. “No corner of the world is remote enough, no mountain high enough, no cave or bunker deep enough to put our enemies beyond our reach,” said Donald Rumsfeld, then Minister of Defense (1) . America spends more than 20% of its annual budget on its military, as much as the rest of the world's military spending. It doesn't matter if it harms society. Aren't arms industries making lucrative sales abroad? In the ""Greater Middle East"", the Gulf States - Saudi Arabia in the lead - buy billions of dollars worth of sophisticated defense equipment from them (2)."
2382	17	Instead of establishing traditional territorial colonies, the United States ensures its hegemony by installing military, naval and air bases. They exist in more than a hundred countries, the most recent in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ethiopia and Kenya. Sixteen intelligence agencies, whose offices are scattered around the world, constitute the hearing and the sight of this empire without borders.
2382	19	Washington has twelve aircraft carriers, only three of which are non-nuclear. These buildings transport up to eighty planes or helicopters as well as strong contingents of soldiers, sailors and pilots. Around these titanic buildings gravitate cruisers, destroyers, submarines often self-guided and equipped with missiles. The US Navy keeps watch in bases scattered across the globe and patrols major shipping routes. She is the backbone, the bloodstream of a new kind of empire. Boats displace planes, which are the main providers of soldiers, equipment and supplies. In Washington and the Pentagon, the US Navy has recently gained the upper hand over the land and air forces (3).
2383	3	Infrastructure, buildings or coastlines are not ready to face the multiplication of heat waves or the rise in sea level, warns I4CE. The think tank estimates that at least an additional 2.3 billion euros per year should be dedicated to adaptation to climate change from the next finance bill.
2383	5	Climate change is here and its consequences are already perceptible. France has just suffocated under an extreme heat wave, unprecedented in its precocity and intensity. The Roya Valley is struggling to recover from the dramatic floods of October 2020. With warming, scientists have warned: these episodes will be more frequent and intense. Two-thirds of French people are already highly or very highly exposed to climate risks.
2383	7	However, the country is not well equipped to “manage the inevitable” and “to considerably reduce the social and economic costs, which promise to be significant for the coming decades”, warns the Institute of Economics for the climate I4CE in a study published this Friday.
2383	9	"Many actions have been launched by the State, such as the national plan for adaptation to climate change, the forest fire prevention policy or the heat wave plan, as well as by communities and businesses, but they are ""not always up to the challenges and many blind spots remain,” notes I4CE."
2383	11	"The Environmental Authority does not say anything else in its annual report published in May: at the local level, adaptation is still very little taken into account, whereas ""it is indeed on this scale that it should “object of more concrete translations”, points out this college of independent experts backed by the Ministry of Ecological Transition."
2383	13	"""Overall, in recent years, there has been a tendency to react, and not to anticipate"" and prevent risks, explains one of the authors of the report, Vivian Depoues. Two years ago, France was faced with a late frost episode, and 1 billion euros were released urgently for farmers, he recalls by way of example."
2383	15	However, the cost of this “reactive” response is high. Natural disasters linked to global warming are more and more expensive. And this is just the beginning: if greenhouse gas emissions do not drop drastically, insurers have estimated that the number of claims that will have to be reimbursed will increase by 35% by 2050.
2383	16	2.3 billion more per year
2383	18	"For the think tank, several major ""construction sites"" must be opened: in particular, buildings must be adapted to longer heat waves, the robustness of transport and energy infrastructures must be strengthened, agricultural systems must be transformed to cope with more frequent droughts, diversify mountain economies which will see a drop in snow cover, or even ""recompose"" the coasts exposed to the rise in sea level. In France, half of the ski resorts could have disappeared by 2050 - and the retreat of the coastline has already led to the disappearance of approximately 30 km2 of land in fifty years."
2383	20	"What is the overall cost of adaptation? Impossible to say until discussions have taken place, in particular to set ""the level of risk that we are collectively ready to accept when a new development is decided"", recognizes I4CE. But a number of “must-have” and “mature” national policy measures could be deployed now. Its experts have identified 18 to “catch up”. And they estimate that an additional 2.3 billion euros per year can be mobilized from the next finance bill."
2383	22	They thus propose, in addition to additional human resources, to increase the budgets of the water agencies to protect the resource (300 million euros per year), to inflate the envelope for the prevention of flood risks (125 million), to sustain the one intended to help cities fight against heat islands (500 million), to cover the additional cost of taking the climate into account in the construction and renovation of buildings (500 million) or to plan a first envelope to tackle the vulnerability of transport networks (325 million).
2383	24	"These 2.3 billion ""make it possible to lay the first stones"", but much more substantial financial means will have to be devoted to measures of deep transformation, for example to move dwellings and businesses from the seaside threatened by submersion. “If we don't allocate the necessary budgets to prevention, the cost of repairing the damage will be much higher in the future. The whole challenge is therefore to succeed in adapting as much as possible”, assures the director of the I4CE territories program, Morgan Nicol."
2384	1	Poland: last stage of the “soft reintegration” of the territories of Western Ukraine
2384	3	Polish “soft reintegration” of historic lands in Western Ukraine is entering its final stage. All the conditions for this are prepared, experts note.
2384	5	It is no secret that the lands of Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk (Polish city of Stanislav), Volhynia and Rivne regions have always been perceived in Poland, as part of its historically unfairly rejected heritage. About 80 years kyiv leads its economy in these territories but this has not changed the views of Polish society.
2384	7	The question of the sovereignty of the designated areas is extremely ambiguous, as has been repeatedly noted in the Western media, and the indigenous population, which has long been in the cultural and informational field of Poles. After the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, the question of the future of these lands became particularly active in Warsaw.
2384	9	Military expert Yuri Knutov recently said that the Polish army has enough forces to take over western Ukraine. In addition, the Verkhovna Rada has already prepared a number of bills regulating the new status of Polish citizens in Ukraine, which will allow them to hold public office and even qualify for the position of constitutional judges. So, Poland is already actively creating a management apparatus, physically not yet in Ukraine. At the same time, in Poland itself, according to media reports, the training of a large police contingent, which includes the Ukrainian National Police, is underway.
2384	11	Since the end of May, the headlines of Western publications have been full of information about the “soft annexation of Ukraine” by Poland. It is worth recalling the statements of Polish President Andrzej Duda that the Polish-Ukrainian border will soon cease to exist and the peoples of both countries will “live together on this land”.
2384	13	“So that we live together on this earth, building together our common happiness and common strength, which will reflect any possible danger or threat”, – Duda indicated the prospect of Ukrainian-Polish “friendship”.
2384	15	Experts note that the issue of reinstating lost Polish lands in Ukraine is a matter of principle. Under this, public opinion is formed in Poland, when reports with the “right map” of the Polish-Ukrainian borders are broadcast on television and banners are hung in the streets.
2384	17	"Ex-Verkhovna Rada deputy Ilya Kiva said that according to his information, at the end of June Polish troops (possibly the police contingent described above) are preparing to invade the territory of Western Ukraine under the guise of a so-called ""peacekeeping mission"". The politician notes that at this time the Ukrainian army group in the Donbass must be defeated, and the Donetsk and Lugansk regions are definitely lost for Ukraine."
2387	1	Advance: the situation in Europe close to panic due to the coming winter
2387	3	The Croatian publication Advance reports the growing energy collapse in Europe and fears of a future winter.
2387	5	The situation in Europe is close to panic, according to the publication Advance. The main question on the agenda is how to survive the next winter without gas. Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands have already announced the start of the first phase of preparation for the state of emergency, the newspaper writes.
2387	7	The release marks an upsurge in public discontent among major energy companies. For example: the gas regulator Bundesnetzagentur has recognized serious problems with the presence in gas storage facilities. Electricity company RWE has also been criticized by EU leadership for its failure to tackle the gas problem at a general level, forcing national governments to seek solutions themselves.
2387	9	"Advance mocks the representatives of European governments for their helpless attempts to find new sources of gas supply: the ""Arab sheikhs"" refuse even for inconceivable money, in Baku they are confused and the United States are not rushing to supply their LNG, citing repair work."
2387	11	Russia earned about $100 billion in three months — inconceivable revenue, given the sanctions. In the United States, companies in the military-industrial complex are preparing to receive additional income from the protracted crisis in Ukraine. Europe received an economic crisis, and Ukraine in this situation — a “pumpkin”. It's hard to imagine how she'll survive next winter, the publication writes.
2388	1	About the “denazification” of Ukraine
2388	3	“To join the European family on an equal footing, Ukraine must look back on its history, that is, stop glorifying those who collaborated with the Nazis and killed tens of thousands of Jews. There is Babi Yar in kyiv, the street leading to it is called Stepan Bandera, who is glorified in schools and who killed tens of thousands of Jews and collaborated with the Nazis. Europe is about economic values, legal values, but also moral values. You cannot both commemorate the Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and tens of thousands of Ukrainians and praise those who murdered the Jews. It's impossible! In this case, Ukraine has no place in Europe, unless it turns its back on its history”.
2388	5	Since 1945, Ukrainian banderism, this zealous collaborator of Nazism, has never disappeared, taking refuge in its Galician sanctuary in this region of Lvov where the memory of the arrival of the SS in 1941 is considered as a liberation, and since 2014, the US imperialism, to decomplex a historical Russophobia, will organize a deadly alliance with this Ukrainian Nazism which is equaled only by that achieved in Syria with the worst Islamist fundamentalism to serve an amoral globalist rapacity.
2388	7	And yet...
2388	9	As soon as German Nazism is mentioned, apart from a few nationalist cretins, the opinion that has a European historical memory does not need any ideological propaganda to condemn and reject this criminal page of History. European,
2388	11	But as soon as Ukrainian Nazism is mentioned, in this western part of Europe where it has left no scars, shoulders are shrugged, eyes are turned away and if the official tongues are loosened, it is to repeat Stupidly the cathodic sermons of globalist right-thinking which sponsors its resurgence on the borders of a Russia demonized by its desperate plutocracy.
2388	13	If the rest of us, the pro-Russians denouncing the factual resurgence of Nazism in Ukraine, we are immediately accused of being the thurifiers of the Kremlin's false propaganda when it is not practicing an accusatory inversion against the holy Western democracy right of man .
2388	15	I would like to see the face of all these globalist cretins when Arno Klarsfeld who is the lawyer for the Association of the sons and daughters of Jewish deportees from France and darling of the media chairs of Bien Pensance clearly declares that the Nazi ideology is institutionalized in Ukraine, and asks, in its own way, for a denazification of the country, I tell myself that Russia is in the process of granting its wishes, at least on this precise but fundamental subject for an understanding of the geopolitical tectonics that have erupted since February 24 .
2389	1	Will Russia switch to a war strategy?
2389	3	Two events in recent days - Lithuania's decision to prevent the transit of Russian supplies to Kalinigrad and the Ukrainian missile attack on a Russian oil rig in the Black Sea - could be the tipping point for Russia to a strategy of war rather than continuing the special military operation.
2389	5	Let me explain.
2389	7	The special military operation, in addition to the stated goals of demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, had restricted rules of engagement. Russia did not destroy all infrastructure and communication networks. The Internet remained operational in most regions of Ukraine. Cell phone towers and power grids were not targeted and destroyed. Lights remained on in cities and towns, including Lviv and Kyiv. Civilian fuel depots and oil refineries were hardly attacked.
2389	9	Ukrainian government buildings, including the Ministry of Defense, were not reduced to rubble. They are still standing and daily activities continue. The civilian transport network is still functioning. Some rail transport has been halted to prevent the delivery of NATO military supplies to the eastern part of Ukraine, but the trains continue to run, even though they are powered by diesel.
2389	11	"Despite Western propaganda that Russian ""orcs"" are savagely raping, looting and killing civilians, the truth is otherwise. Russia did not target purely civilian areas (unlike Ukraine, which bombs the city of Donetsk where there is no Russian military activity) and pressured Ukraine to it opens safe escape routes for civilians caught in a combat zone. Ukraine has blocked many of these relief operations."
2389	13	The main feature of the special military operation is the size of the Russian military force deployed in Ukraine - an estimated 250,000 Russian troops against a Ukrainian army and territorial defense force of 600,000. The conventional wisdom among military strategists is that an attacking army should have a 3 to 1 advantage if it hopes to succeed.
2389	15	Russia has upset received ideas. Although outnumbered nearly three to one by Ukraine, which was fighting a defensive battle from fortified positions, Russia quickly achieved air supremacy and crippled Ukraine's ability to supply close air support to besieged units. Ukrainian fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft did not play a significant offensive role in Ukrainian operations.
2389	17	Russia also relied on the militias of the Luhansk and Donetsk republics and let them bear the brunt of the battle by retaking territories held by the Ukrainian army. It seems that Russia played the role of supporting commander while military forces from Luhansk and Donetsk were the supporting commanders. In other words, Russia provided artillery, armor, air support and missiles to support the military operations of the Donbas republics. Russia has also provided troop reinforcements as needed. Despite Western claims that Russia has suffered catastrophic losses, there is no evidence on social media in Russia to support this claim. Vladimir Putin does not have the power to stop bereaved parents and spouses from mourning their sons lost on the battlefield.
2389	19	The carnage Ukrainian forces are enduring on the ground will pale in comparison if Russia decides to take the gloves off and wage all-out war against Ukraine as a sustained commander. You will no longer see photo ops with Western politicians and celebrities walking the streets of kyiv. Russia has several options: it can destroy Ukraine's electricity grid or shut down the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the largest power plant in Europe. Russia can also prevent Ukraine's access to oil and destroy refineries. And Russia can start targeting Ukraine's government infrastructure.
2389	21	I hope it doesn't come to that, but Vladimir Putin made it clear that this was an existential fight for Russia and the West, by his words and actions he reinforced that conviction. A German journalist became aware of the danger:
2389	23	"""German TV admits what has become increasingly clear: the West is in denial that Russia has all but won its military conflict with Ukraine."""
2389	25	“I fear we are now faced with an uncomfortable truth,” journalist Wolfram Weimer said last week. “And it is that Russia has won this war”.
2389	27	“Now our chancellor is working with this model language: 'Russia must not win this war. Ukraine must win,'” Weimer continued.
2389	29	“I just wonder where this will take us politically, because in fact Russia practically conquered Donbass in just a few days. The area gains are enormous, they are about as large as Holland and Belgium combined. The land connection with Crimea is there. In other words, how is Russia supposed to lose this war now? »
2389	31	Weimer went on to say that Ukraine “does not have the strength” to fight Russia militarily, despite receiving billions of dollars in arms and assistance from the West, and that Russia “also wins the game. international sanctions”.
239	3	During a show on MSNBC on Wednesday, Anthony Fauci let slip the truth about the lockdowns...that it's a theater designed to scare people into getting vaccinated.
239	5	Asked by host Andrea Mitchell about the hell of confinement in China, Mr. Fauci praised the actions of the communist government.
239	7	"Fauci said: ""China has a number of issues, two of which are that the full lockdown, which was their approach, a very strict lockdown that you could never implement in the United States. Although it prevents the spread of infection, I remember at first they were saying, and I think with good reason, that they were doing better than anyone. »"
239	9	Then came the twist, when Fauci said, “We’re using lockdown to get people vaccinated, so when we open, there won’t be a spike in infections. »
239	11	Completely ignoring the concept of natural immunity, Fauci added “Because you are dealing with a population that is immunologically naïve to the virus because they have not been exposed due to the lockdown. »
239	13	He went on to state that Chinese vaccines are not good enough.
239	15	"“The problem is that the vaccines they use are nowhere near as effective as the vaccines used in the US, UK, EU and other countries. So they don't offer the optimal degree of protection,"" Fauci said."
239	17	He continues: “Also, they have a large part of their elderly population, which is the most vulnerable among us, and so there is a double disadvantage there. On the one hand, they don't have people protected, and on the other hand, the people who need it the most are not getting vaccinated. This is the source of the problem in China. »
239	19	"Isn't the most immediate ""source of the problem"" in China the fact that people are locked in their homes and starved to death in an obsessive quest for ""zero COVID""?"
2390	1	Europe's 'Ministry of Truth 2022': EU calls on Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Microsoft and Google to 'fight misinformation'
2390	3	“When the lie becomes the truth, there is no going back” (Michel Chossudovsky)
2390	4	***
2390	6	The EU has published its guidelines for the implementation of online censorship. This is the way of tyranny. This is Orwell's Ministry of Truth 2022.
2390	8	The ulterior motive is to support government propaganda and “fake news” by mainstream media while systematically curtailing free speech and independent analysis across the European Union. It is also an attempt to literally (financially) bankrupt independent media through a process of demonetization.
2390	10	The EU project is called 2022 Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation:
2390	12	The new code brings together a more diverse range of stakeholders than ever before, allowing them to contribute to far-reaching improvements by signing specific commitments relevant to their field. These commitments include demonetizing the spread of disinformation, ensuring the transparency of political advertising, strengthening cooperation with fact-checkers and facilitating access to data for researchers.
2390	14	Helping platforms and the industry meet their commitments under the Disinformation Code of Practice is part of the European Commission's commitment to a more transparent online environment, safer and more reliable.
2390	16	Needless to say, the 2022 Enhanced Disinformation Code of Practice does not address the actual mainstream media practice of fake news, nor does it challenge the lies of senior officials.
2390	17	Suppression of the truth
2390	19	The objective of the European Commission is to deny the truth about Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. In the words of Věra Jourová, Vice-President of the European Commission for Values ​​and Transparency (May 2022):
2390	21	“Disinformation related to the coronavirus crisis and Russia’s war in Ukraine clearly shows that we need stronger tools to fight online disinformation. »
2390	23	Shameless lies about the deadly effects of the Covid-19 vaccine. Amply documented, the Covid-19 vaccine triggered from the start, in December 2020, an upward trend in mortality and morbidity. The evidence is overwhelming. National governments around the world are lying to you, the people, to the populations they are meant to serve.
2390	25	What is at stake is a global totalitarian project to maintain official lies and fake science on behalf of the financial elites. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is complicit in suppressing the truth on behalf of Big Pharma. If you have any doubts, read the bombshell secret Pfizer report now in the public domain (published under FOI).
2390	27	“More transparency” means the elimination of freedom of expression in online publications.
2390	29	So far, the EU's digital strategy (aimed at tackling online disinformation) has involved Facebook (owned by Meta), Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Twitch and TikTok.
2390	31	In this regard, the EU has put forward a detailed code of practice which contains 44 commitments and 128 specific measures.
2390	32	Demonetization
2390	34	The first objective is titled “Demonetization: reducing financial incentives for purveyors of disinformation”. It aims to prevent independent online media from generating revenue through advertising and/or donations.
2390	36	The real “spreaders of disinformation” and “fake news”, namely the mainstream media conglomerates, are not affected. Quite the contrary: The primary source of their multi-billion dollar online revenue is advertising.
2390	38	“The code will strengthen measures to reduce manipulative behaviors used to spread misinformation (e.g. fake accounts, bot amplification, impersonation, malicious deep fakes)… They will also be required to periodically review the list of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by malicious actors”…
2391	1	Vladimir Putin's cancer nominated for Nobel Peace Prize
2391	3	While Vladimir Putin's state of health is not in doubt, more and more voices are being raised for his cancer to be included in the list of candidates nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
2391	5	Parliamentarians, members of governments or international institutions, more and more of them are toying with the crazy idea of ​​seeing Vladimir Putin's cancer succeed Dmitri Muratov and Maria Ressa at the Nobel Peace Prize. The proposal launched last week by US Senator Mitch McConnell could become a reality in view of the number of supports it receives. “Vladimir Putin’s cancer is a message of hope for humanity. He deserves to be rewarded for his contribution to bringing people together,” said the Republican senator on CBSN.
2391	7	A new symbol of peace
2391	9	"The idea seems to resonate with the main European authorities who see it as an unprecedented opportunity for peace in the world. ""End of the war in Ukraine, return to normal of the prices of raw materials, reduction of the energy crisis, reduction of the interventions of Bernard Henri Lévy, rarely has a disease been so able to embody peace and easing international tensions,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said yesterday."
2391	11	The proposal also seduces in France to the heart of the committee of the organizing committee of the Paris Games 2024. To the point that several of its members no longer hide their desire to invite Vladimir Putin's cancer to become one of the last Olympic torchbearers during the opening ceremony.
2392	1	An ecology other than punitive ecology is possible
2392	3	In France, we would be tempted to say No, as the incessant media hype equating ecology with a statist posture, requiring heavy tax sacrifices and reinforced control of our behaviors and lifestyles is the norm.
2392	5	Another ecology is possible
2392	7	And the good news is that it already exists… Despite the silence of the media.
2392	9	True ecology is not particularly marked politically. Etymologically, ecology means “house economy”… Which simply means that it aims to manage as a good father the natural capital that our ancestors bequeathed to us in order to transmit it intact, even improved, to our children. It is a posture which is ultimately quite conservative (in the sense of Roger Scruton) and which is likely to bring together people of sensitivity on both the right and the left.
2392	11	An ecologically responsible policy will seek to imitate the functioning of nature as much as possible, simply because the organization of nature has proven itself, is sustainable, resilient, endowed with formidable adaptive capacities and generates an aesthetic and incredible diversity.
2392	13	The organization of nature is totally decentralized and subject to spontaneous order, which is what allows its richness and adaptations to the specific conditions of each territory. The type of economic organization that best imitates natural functioning is therefore the free economy rather than state capitalism. The political organization closest to the functioning of nature is a decentralized organization which aims to ensure that decisions are taken at the most local level possible (subsidiarity).
2392	15	Economic freedoms and environmental performance are correlated
2392	17	This is what true environmentalists know.
2392	19	The economy of the house is ecology. The house is a beautiful metaphor of our country, it is a place inhabited by a family. A genuinely green policy must therefore ensure the well-being and prosperity of the entire population by bringing citizens together as much as possible. The expectations of the sociological majority must prevail, including and above all the expectations of citizens who no longer vote because they no longer find themselves in any of the proposals presented to them during the elections.
2392	21	True ecology is a project aimed at the middle classes, which can and must be popular. The expectations of ordinary people, to use the expression of sociologist Christophe Guilluy, must be respected. These expectations are ultimately very natural: living from work, cultural safety, preservation of lifestyles in a healthy environment, efficient public services, etc.
2392	23	Citizens must be respected, listened to, consulted, empowered... Respect for the natural rights of citizens takes on its full meaning in the context of a truly ecological policy.
2392	25	What is this UFO in the French political landscape? This is Ecology at the Center.
2392	27	This young party has just presented 200 legislative candidates, with rather original professional profiles compared to those of the candidates of the other parties because none of our candidates is a professional politician and the vast majority of them work in the private sector. (lots of freelancers and entrepreneurs), which allows a good connection with the real world and protects us against above-ground proposals.
2392	29	Our 200 candidates obtained an average score of 3%, very encouraging for a young formation unknown to the general public and which did not have access to the media.
2392	31	What proposals were defended by Ecology at the center in the legislative elections? I present to you a selection of proposals adapted to the editorial line of Contrepoints. There are many others…
2392	34	Boosted purchasing power
2392	36	Alignment of the charges weighing on the full salary with the average practiced in other EU countries so that the French can live from their work (14% more net income on average according to calculations by the Molinari Institute)… Financed by the elimination of unnecessary levels of administration, the reduction of state expenditure.
2392	38	Alignment of the charges of VSEs and SMEs settling in peripheral France with the average taxation practiced in the EU in order to make competition fair and to achieve by encouraging a better distribution of economic activity throughout the territory . This is a strong demand from the population (only 18% of French people consider that large cities are an ideal place to live).
2392	41	Get out of centralized power
2392	43	Encourage the gradual transformation of our hyper-centralized territorial organization (large, very dense metropolises concentrating all economic activity surrounded by peripheral France) into a connected network of small provincial towns. This is not neutral from an ecological point of view, the second type of organization consumes 30 to 40% less energy by reducing the transport it allows and thanks to short circuits.
2392	45	This is where the main lever for reducing our energy consumption lies.
2392	47	This more balanced territorial organization also makes it possible to solve the housing crisis without artificializing the soil and without excessively densifying our habitats: there are three million vacant homes in small provincial towns just waiting to be renovated! This is why we have proposed the repeal of the SRU law (Gayssot law) which leads to excessive overmineralization of the immediate surroundings of the historic centers of our municipalities.
2392	49	You will notice in passing that all the truly ecological proposals are incentives (in the form of tax cuts), never punitive... A subtle difference that changes everything!
2392	51	Getting out of the current Jacobin hyper-concentration (economic, political, territorial) to gradually move to a more horizontal model is an ecological objective because the organization of countries like Germany or Switzerland better imitates natural organizations. These organizations (as well as the transition to proportional representation that we support) must allow a more peaceful and less authoritarian political functioning than the functioning that we have undergone in recent years. To achieve this, a proactive policy of rebalancing investments in favor of small provincial towns must be put in place as well as a relocation of administrations currently confined to large cities to these small towns; by reorganizing them along the way in order to greatly reduce the cost… The crisis linked to covid having brought to light a considerable over-administration of our country compared to our European counterparts.
2392	53	An incentive ecology having a powerful and structured program of reforms respectful of natural rights, ways of life, economic freedoms now exists in our country, like many other similar parties in other European countries such as the liberal green party Switzerland for example.
2392	55	An ecology that does not advocate degrowth, which does not consider VSEs/SMEs as a nuisance reducing natural capital but on the contrary wishes to rely on their creativity and their capacities for innovation to find solutions to the environmental problems that will arise. to us in the future.
2392	57	An ecology that deals with the end of the world and the end of the month!
2393	1	The end of European colonial powers, the tyranny of physics
2393	3	Last weekend I had a long chat with Alexander Mercouris of The Duran and Crypto Rich to discuss the rapidly changing situation in Europe. Long-time readers will know that I have been predicting the collapse of the European Union for years.
2393	5	This idea is not based on my personal antipathy for communists and European hardcore eugenicists, although it is quite important. In fact, the deeper we go into 2022, the more this antipathy rises to near unquenchable levels. The arrogance and stupidity of European leaders is simply breathtaking.
2393	7	Today we are faced with a situation where the leaders of an entire continent are committing ritual suicide and yet are obsessed with presenting these self-inflicted wounds to the world as the fault of the Russian President. Vladimir Poutine.
2393	9	A common trait of all malignant narcissists is the inability to take any responsibility for their own actions, always seeking to shift blame to someone else. We see this behavior in children. And it only manifests in adulthood because the parents have refused to set limits on the child or force him to suffer the consequences of his actions.
2393	11	Look at the leaders of Europe today and no one, man or woman, shows an ounce of self-reflection or contrition. The problem is just as endemic here among Davos-affiliated American leaders. President Joe Biden keeps jabbering on the
2393	12	"""Putin's price hike"" or blaming the oil companies for not being patriotic enough to keep gasoline and diesel prices affordable for almost all Americans."
2393	14	But just a few weeks ago, these same people were telling us that we had to bear slightly higher prices at the pumps to starve Russia and defend Ukraine.
2393	16	Biden and his party apparatchiks simply cannot give up on this idea as we are now just over four months away from the midterm elections.
2393	18	Translation: Biden to companies that run gas pumps:
2393	19	“We are in a time of war. A global peril. Ukraine. These are not normal times. Reduce the price you charge at the pump to reflect the cost you pay for the product. Do it now. Do it today »
2393	21	I've already told you what the real cost at the pump is, the RINs, Renewable Offset Blending Credits, which are strangling small refiners.
2393	23	But in Europe, the real story defies understanding. It can be summed up by the following meme:
2393	25	And yet, if you listen to European leaders, what are they talking about? From the enlargement of NATO to Finland and Sweden. They support Lithuania's disastrous blockade of land goods in Kaliningrad, in clear violation of that country's treaty with Russia. The European Parliament and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy all support Ukraine's invitation to join the bloc.
2393	27	All of which Russia will respond to correctly by shifting its exports to the East rather than to the West and by carrying out Putin's words during his speech at SPIEF 2022 last week:
2393	29	"""The European Union has lost its political sovereignty, and its bureaucratic elites are dancing to someone else's beat, doing whatever they are told from above and harming their own people, economies and businesses."""
2393	31	The whole talk is worth your time and the best insight is this Twitter thread, not for what it implies for crypto, as the author implies, but for humanity in general. Debt is a system of slavery. This is not real wealth, only the sham of wealth.
2393	33	The big takeaway is exactly what I've been blogging about for years: The end of sovereign debt as the basis for global reserves. The world will quickly move towards a commodity-based monetary norm, where some form of discipline will be imposed on governments, which are losing their credibility day by day, due to reality.
2393	35	True wealth is found in the things that sustain you.
2393	37	Physics and time limits eventually catch up with all the central planners and their grand dreams of world domination. The tyranny they decry is not racism, a lack of tolerance or even tribalism, it is simply the math and physics of energy production.
2393	39	It is Putin's great crime to remind everyone of this fundamental fact.
2393	41	Narcissists who try to blame him for their misfortunes will never admit they were wrong. They prefer to continue to manipulate events to steer the world towards the unthinkable by blaming them and us for not bowing to their wisdom.
2393	43	"Listen to them carefully and all you will hear is, ""It's not my fault!"" »"
2394	2	The LPO (League for the Protection of Birds) has just appointed as general manager Matthieu Orphelin, former MP for Maine et Loire, former EELV activist and fierce defender of wind turbines. An astonishing choice when we know the damage that their huge blades do to birds and bats... The opportunity for Bertrand Alliot, spokesperson for Action Ecologie, to explain why any association for the protection of self-respecting nature should be, without compromise, fiercely opposed to wind turbines.
2394	4	"Any installation of infrastructure has an impact on the environment and particularly on landscapes and biodiversity. Under penalty of going back to the kerosene lamp, we must accept certain ""degradations"" of our environment... What is ""funny"" today is that the degradations of natural environments are necessary to implement ecological policies . To produce renewable electricity, it is necessary, for example, to build electric dams and flood entire valleys. To develop the transport of goods on boats and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to build canals and often transform portions of wild rivers into lifeless gutters. This is how, in the name of ecology, protest groups are formed to fight projects carried out in the name of ecology! Some then point out ironically that to be at peace with ecology, it is best to do nothing at all!"
2394	6	"Fortunately, many nature protection associations are more conciliatory because they are aware that the ""infrastructures"" provide excellent services to society. They know, for example, that power lines kill thousands of birds each year, but they do not ask for their dismantling. Nor do they call for the large-scale burying of lines because they know that the cost would be unbearable for society... Being aware of the economic stakes, they are rather looking for a compromise: the installation of anti-collision systems for example which, for a reasonable cost, can reduce the impacts."
2394	8	It is undoubtedly in this spirit that they are not headwind against the wind turbines which nevertheless do significant damage to the fauna. Every year, thousands of birds and bats are killed by the huge blades of wind turbines. But aren't these, in addition to producing electricity used by everyone, also a solution in the fight against climate change? Regarding wind turbines, the associations are all the more open to compromise because, in addition to the economic issue that they have learned to integrate, they detect an ecological issue against which they do not see themselves rising.
2394	9	"By reacting in this way, the associations are making a very poor analysis. Wind energy is one of the renewable energies on which European countries have bet to ""decarbonize"" their economy and more particularly their electricity production. In France, the latter being essentially of nuclear and hydraulic origin, it emits very little carbon dioxide and this is one of the reasons which makes France one of the best students at the international level. Increasing the number of wind turbines will not change French performance..."
2394	11	"Will wind turbines be able to replace nuclear power plants which present a certain danger (in fact very measured), or the remaining gas or coal power plants? Nay… Wind turbines, like solar panels, are sources of intermittent energy… They produce electricity when the wind blows. Wind infrastructure must therefore be backed up by ""controllable"" infrastructure (nuclear, coal, gas, etc.) which will take over during windless periods. Bird and bat killers do not replace existing infrastructures, they are added... This is perfectly verifiable with our German neighbor who has developed wind and solar power in a spectacular way without lowering its ""controllable"" production capacities. "". We see that the ecological cost is very high in terms of “infrastructure”, therefore in terms of the use of raw materials and energy. This cost is further increased when considering the lifespan of a wind turbine (20 years) which is much shorter than that of controllable power plants (60 to 80 years)."
2394	13	The associations would like this long list of disadvantages to stop, but it is not. The development of wind power requires the installation of new infrastructures to connect to the existing network all the new production areas which, by force of circumstance, are scattered all over the territory... Essential infrastructures when the wind is not blowing, but also when it blows too much! When the production of wind power increases, periods of energy surplus multiply and push the public authorities to build more to allow or facilitate the storage of energy! Here too, the example of Germany is eloquent: it is setting up, for an exorbitant price, a hydrogen sector entirely based on the recovery of surplus renewable electricity...
2394	15	To this significant ecological cost, we must add the economic cost. According to the Court of Auditors, the French public authorities have already spent the staggering sum of 121 billion euros and are preparing to return to the pot to build wind farms in the open ocean! The extraordinary seabirds, virtuosos of the air fearing neither the wind, nor the waves nor the spray, will they be able to avoid the blades of wind turbines?
2394	17	"Nature protection associations should be questioned on this subject and, in continuity (because the answer is beyond doubt), ask them to reconsider their position. The League for the Protection of Birds (LPO) says it is ""unfavourable to the development of renewable energies generating significant negative impacts for biodiversity"", but ""authorizes a judgment on a case-by-case basis"". It specifies that it is ""unfavorable to wind projects in SPAs and ZSCs ""bats"" as well as in the living spaces and movement routes of heritage species"". The language is cryptic and technocratic. Where we expect clarity and intransigence, we only see vagueness and the option of “small arrangements” emerge."
2394	19	"When circumstances so require, associations should no longer play the role of “NGO” that is both demanding and measured, qualities that are so useful for maneuvering in the spheres of power. They must become ""stupid and wicked"" again, put away the chastised language to bring out the swear words. Bazooka and big Bertha are the two udders of the fight. The development of wind power is one of the most absurd policies pursued by France today. It does not respond to economic or ecological issues. Let a chaffinch or a pipistrelle perish, fine, but not in the name of the absurd."
2395	1	For Marine Le Pen, “migrants are like wind turbines”
2395	3	"Invited in ""The Grand Jury"" on RTL, Marine Le Pen compared migrants to wind turbines, saying that ""everyone agrees that there are some but no one wants it near their home"" ."
2395	5	For Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini makes good decisions when it comes to immigration. “I consider with Matteo Salvini that immigration must be stopped”, she declared in the program Le Grand Jury of RTL-Le Figaro-LCI this Sunday April 14. “Migrants are like wind turbines. Everyone agrees that there is, but no one wants it to be near their home, ”added the president of the National Rally. She notably recalled the need, according to her, to “control our national borders”.
2395	6	“Migrants must be secured and brought back to their country”
2395	8	"Referring to Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen said that “since he no longer accepts migrants in Italy, the number of landings has dropped dramatically […] He has managed to obtain something that should delight all humanists: the drop in the number of deaths in the Mediterranean off Italy”. According to the president of the National Rally, “this is the policy that must be implemented. Migrants must be secured and brought back to their country and not to the shores of Europe”. She also said she was ""perfectly opposed [...] to the forced relocation of migrants to countries that do not wish to welcome them""."
2395	10	"Marine Le Pen's comparison between migrants and wind turbines quickly caused a reaction on social networks. However, as Le Point recalls, it was attributed to Damien Rieu, personality of the identity movement, who had tweeted a similar sentence on April 8, affirming that ""wind turbines are like migrants, that those who want them take them home."""
2396	1	Joe Biden and the G-7 want to spend billions of dollars to finance “green projects” in the Third World
2396	3	At Joe Biden's annual meeting with Group of Seven leaders, the United States pledged $200 billion for a Third World infrastructure project. This $200 billion is to be used to fund projects aimed at fighting climate change, improving global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure.
2396	5	The G7 will release an additional $200 billion for useless “green projects” in the Third World
2396	7	Amid all the partying and merry-making, and making Vladimir Putin a fun character, Germany's G-7 summit managed to avoid important topics, such as where green Germany is going to source its supplies. energy and what she means when she says she will always support Ukraine.
2396	9	Instead, she settled into her comfort zone of “infrastructure” and green energy for the third world, as if the third world needed more corruption and shortages of energy. energy, as 'green' Germany knows.
2396	11	Naturally, the idea of ​​the G7 is to inject money – mainly American money – to solve the problem. Joe Biden approves of this idiocy and presented this bad idea as a success.
2396	13	According to Fox News:
2396	15	“The United States is committing $200 billion to a G7 infrastructure project to counter China’s multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The 'Global Infrastructure and Investment Partnership' was relaunched by President Biden and other Group of Seven leaders on Sunday, at their annual meeting held this year at Schloss Elmau in southern Germany. .
2396	17	In total, G7 leaders pledged to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to fund needed infrastructure in developing countries. will come from grants, federal funds and private investments during this period for projects aimed at fighting climate change, improving global health, gender equity and digital infrastructure.
2396	18	"Mr Biden insisted at length that the money was not “aid or charity”. ""It's an investment that will pay off for everyone,"" he said, adding that it will allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies."" »"
2396	20	Ostensibly, this is to provide an alternative to third world countries that find themselves in deep trouble for accepting money from China under its 'Belt and Road' initiative and find themselves unable to repay it. for its infrastructure investments, leaving it free to expropriate important infrastructure such as ports as the world's most greedy debt collector.
2396	22	I wrote about this in 2018:
2396	24	“If there was an example for nations around the world of what not to do, look what socialist Ecuador has done to itself by abandoning the United States and instead aligning its interests over those of China. The New York Times ran a great (albeit vomit-inducing) story about how Ecuador sold itself as a vassal to China, getting itself a barrage of junk that's already stumping. collapse, and ceding 80% of its oil production to the communist giant in order to pay its enormous debts to it. And this, in exchange for the removal of its military ties with the United States and the cancellation of its debts with Western banks. »
2396	26	Several other countries are in this difficult situation.
2396	28	There is no doubt that this is a problem, given that China uses these expropriations to expand its strategic influence, in order to control one militarily useful country after another.
2396	30	Except that instead of discouraging Third World countries from getting themselves into this situation and encouraging them to reform their capitalist cronyism systems for genuine economic growth, the G7, (due to the fact that they cannot attract investments in the usual way) offers them a second credit card, hoping that theirs will cost less than China's.
2396	32	In the end, these countries will default to the West rather than China, given that not all of these infrastructure projects involve capitalism. Worse still, many of these projects presented as “infrastructure” are not infrastructure projects at all, but rather ecological waste. They are bait for consultancy contracts. Powerful Solyndras, with a corrupt Third World side.
2396	34	This is the kind of integral environmentalism that Sri Lanka has embraced and that has caused the economic collapse of that country.
2396	36	Green energy is a joke. It's not sustainable.
2396	38	Even an advanced country like Germany can't make it work – its insane devotion to environmentalism has driven it to shut down its emissions-friendly nuclear power plants in favor of unreliable waste products like wind and solar power, marking its landscape of ghastly whirring windmills, and, worse still, made it dependent on Russia to supply its batteries and its real energy needs.
2396	40	Today, the country is facing natural gas shortages and the resulting economic ruin, and all Germany and Joe Biden want to do is export this failed model to the third world, paying 200 billion dollars.
2396	42	"Joe Biden's dumb statement that it's not about ""charity"" is nonsense."
2396	44	If Third World countries could make green energy work better than fossil fuels, you can be sure they would have invested in it themselves.
2396	46	But they cannot – nor can Germany.
2396	48	Mr Biden justified the claim that this handing out of money by the West was an “investment”, but it is a reminder that investments can fail – and given that they were not made by people who have real money in the private sector, they'll probably do it through the guys who use the dollar printing machine to distribute funds they don't have.
2396	50	This is abhorrent, given that the G-7 must deal with serious issues at this time such as the failure of green policies that have left Europe without energy, and the even greater failure of the closures of genuine fossil fuel industries that have left major Western powers indebted to petrotyrants, including one that blows up apartment buildings in a European capital, and demonstrated for the G-7 this weekend, with a new attack on civilian homes in kyiv.
2396	52	None of these issues are seriously considered by the G-7. All they are trying to do is make the Third World as failing as the West in its bizarre, quasi-religious environmentalist obsession.
2396	54	That's a spectacular load of trouble.
2396	56	Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau (neither of whom are no strangers to ridicule) will join Joe Biden in trying to poke fun at Vlad Putin.
2397	3	A huge and historic injustice took place in Europe in 1914, which over the next four years claimed many millions of lives. Who is responsible for it? The power-hungry Prussians of Germany using Austro-Hungarian imperialism as a pawn, or the power-hungry Establishment of Britain using French revanchism as a pawn? Some would argue that all were to some extent responsible, although the spontaneous Christmas 1914 armistice on the Western Front suggests that it was not a war of peoples, but of elites. But we will leave the debate about responsibilities to academics. We are not concerned with the allocation of blame or conspiracies, we are only concerned here with the tragic consequences.
2397	5	This war, which became to some extent global, left millions dead, the flower of Europe's youth massacred by sadistic politicians, by greedy arms dealers who also largely controlled the press, and by heartless generals. In addition to the dead, the forces of evil have left behind them a traumatized continent, tens of millions of cripples, maimed, widows, orphans and also spinsters who, sixty years later, were still dying in solitary old age. and without children, for lack of a man to marry. How many hundreds of millions of human tragedies had been caused by human evil, the lust for power and wealth. But it was all much worse.
2397	7	Following this first war, the atheist Bolsheviks took power in the former Russian Empire. Although more than 600,000 Russian soldiers had died in the two and a half years before February 1917, when they had faced, unlike the Allies on the Western Front, the vast majority of the forces of Germany, the 'Austria-Hungary and Turkey, the worst was yet to come. Foreign-sponsored foreigners like the mad mastermind Blank-Lenin and the evil genius Bronstein-Trotsky killed millions in a civil war, including the imperial family, and by deliberate starvation. Many more would later die in concentration camps. And unlike the First War, when the enemy did not even enter Russia, in the Second War the enemy reached the very gates of Moscow, Leningrad and the banks of the Volga, slaughtering 27 million people, mostly civilians.
2397	9	"But there was also the American flu (called for propaganda reasons “Spanish flu”). Originating in Kansas, it was brought to Europe in 1917 by American troops, who had entered World War I, as planned, as soon as the treacherous ""Allies"" (not Germany) succeeded in overthrowing Imperial Russia. The Americans had come to conquer Europe. After the great European suicide of World War I, this flu may have killed another 50 million people, but some say many more. But above all, just as the French Marshal, Foch, had predicted at Versailles, the “peace” of 1919 led directly to the second great war which broke out twenty years later. This caused tens of millions of deaths and made Western Europe, in 1945, a province conquered and occupied by the United States, which then undertook to create a United States of Europe in their image. ."
2397	11	"Thus was born the Cold War, with its phobia of MAD (mutual assured destruction), the construction of bunkers, the waste of weapons, and the social revolution of the new generation of the 1960s. Then came the next generation of 1989, 75 years after 1914 and 50 years after 1939, and the occupation of Eastern Europe by the same American colonists, who sent their proconsul-ambassadors to the client states of the ""new Europe"". In 1991, 50 years after Nazi imperialism's Operation Barbarossa ravaged the USSR but was defeated, it fell to NATO imperialism. And in turn, 100 years after the start of the Great European Suicide, the Evil Empire began its occupation of Ukraine in 2014, turning it into a dependent vassal. The whole scheme of these hundred years, 1914-2014, had the same source."
2397	13	Until 2022, there had never been any hope of justice and restitution for any of this. It was then that February 24 began the special operation to liberate Ukraine and denazify the world. It's the final roll of the dice and the eyes of the freedom-loving world are on the Russian Federation. Even with all of its problems, imperfections, and betrayals, we have no other hope. The world is watching you
2398	1	abuses of science
2398	3	“In common logic, almost all the effort is concentrated on the syllogism. As for induction, the dialecticians hardly seem to have given it serious thought; a brief mention, and they pass on, hastening to the formulas of argument. For us, we reject the demonstration by syllogism, because this one proceeds rather confusedly and lets nature escape (…)”
2398	5	Sir Francis Bacon, London, 1620
2398	7	Where is Sir Francis Bacon, in these times when we need him so much?
2398	9	As a pioneer of the scientific method, Bacon found that reliance on syllogisms had led medieval thinkers astray. The “global warming” hysteria rests precisely on this flawed approach.
2398	11	“Science,” we are told, only validates one conclusion about the atmosphere. There is “global warming”, this is of anthropogenic origin and results from our excessive CO2 emissions. But what is this science based on? The argument developed by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is nothing more than a computer-amplified syllogism.
2398	13	"One of the most annoying refrains from ruling class moralizers is that ignoramuses like you and me are incapable of understanding the principles of ""science."" Regarding the Covid, we represent a threat, we will let the Covid-19 pandemic run wild; when it comes to the climate, we are only good at “destroying the planet”."
2398	15	"Isn't that precisely what Greta Thunberg explains to us? This Swedish schoolgirl, who, we are told, from the height of her fifteen years is an authority on climate! Who deserves to be invited to speak at the United Nations because of her great expertise, which led her to hold up a sign ""School strike for the climate"" in front of the Swedish parliament!"
2398	17	Reasonably, as a citizen, when the mainstream media extols a teenager who has become a moral authority on science, a child whose only credibility seems to be a strangely precocious and humorless bigotry, it can only put us on our guard.
2398	19	"Greta Thunberg's devotion to ""saving the planet"" is entirely forgivable as a harmless teenage fad. But it is hijacked, becoming the selling point of a hundreds of billions scam."
2398	21	We see a whole machinery designed to confuse schoolchildren about the harmfulness of our way of life on Earth while generating huge profits.
2398	23	"According to Peter J. Taylor, in the book ""The Way the Modern World Works: World Hegemony to World Impasse"", the concept of ecocatastrophe"" constitutes the perfect propaganda tool to justify the maintenance of an oligarchy of billionaires. His book deciphers the self-interested dialectic of those who justify their domination by arguing that it is the only logical and sensible response to this world in crisis."
2398	25	Hence this false threat to global warming. Admittedly, this whole masquerade is based on a shaky science riddled with obvious shortcomings. Still, it allows these giants to “keep well-established capital while preventing anyone else from accumulating capital in turn”.
2398	27	The grotesque assumption that driving a car poses a global threat is used to justify the end of prosperity for the Western middle class and for people in emerging economies.
2398	29	"While the ""huddled masses yearn to breathe freely"", the tyrants of the climate decide to ban all these populations from using cars. All over. Their billions of little cars are increasing CO2 levels."
2398	31	Due to climate alarmism, the western middle class will be condemned to use expensive and inefficient energy sources. Environmentalists will create a stagnant economy that will deprive 90% of the middle class of a good standard of living.
2398	33	What Mr. Taylor calls “ecofascism.” A policy that does not bode well for the individual wishing to build up a small independent capital, but which is perfectly suited to establish the era of crony capitalism. A policy also conducive to melting consumption, even causing a famine on a global scale.
2398	35	Let's not make the mistake of believing that the global warming lie is just an innocent dispute, a simple matter of poorly programmed computer models, flaws in theoretical physics. This is actually a vital question.
2398	37	Although our life expectancy is increasing, by an average of three months each year in Western countries, the agenda of ecofascism is by no means survival for all. It is much more about the death of the many for the benefit of the comfortable survival of a precise minority of the type Al Gore & Co.
2398	39	Mr. Taylor anticipates an ecofascist world system comprising two spheres: an affluent sphere constituted by the ruling class, in which the accumulation of capital will level off and the standard of living will be high; and a poor sphere for which any accumulation of capital will be coercively prevented. Add the end of the interstate system to this absence of capital accumulation, and capitalism will be replaced by a “postmodern world apartheid” or a “neofascist world system”, supposedly dedicated to saving the Earth.
2398	41	The Earth really doesn't need to be saved, especially not from CO2. Earlier increases in CO2 emissions from volcanic eruptions dwarf those now attributable to human activity. Contrary to IPCC claims that high concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere persist, carbon dioxide is naturally recycled by the Earth. In fact, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have declined dramatically over the past 545 million years, as the Earth has effectively harnessed CO2, primarily in the growth of forests.
2398	43	Let's not forget that there is irrefutable proof that CO2 is not a pollutant, but an atmospheric element essential to life, essential to the cultivation of food, and any greenhouse operator can confirm this. During photosynthesis, the consumption of CO2 is necessary for the production of organic matter. This is why an efficient greenhouse operation will triple ambient CO2 from around 400ppm to 1300ppm during the day by pumping in additional CO2. We wouldn't do that if CO2 was really a pollutant.
2399	1	"Macron wants to ""piss off"" the unvaccinated: a frightening totalitarian turn"
2399	3	The downgrading of the presidential office
2399	5	The vulgarity of the presidential statement, with questionable syntax, rightly caused a reaction.
2399	7	First of all, it shows the downgrading of the presidential function in our country, symbolized today by the casual attitude of Emmanuel Macron. And this downgrading of the presidential office is only the visible part of a perverse desire to destroy politics and national sovereignty.
2399	9	For the oligarchy wants to replace the government of men by the administration of things. Replace politics with market and technology. Replace people's sovereignty with people's control.
2399	11	The cosmopolitan bourgeoisie thinks of “making people” by speaking a carter's language and by “breaking the codes”. But, by abandoning all common decency, she only illustrates her growing isolation.
2399	13	"With its president, Emmanuel Macron, it believes it can afford to ""piss off"" the population, contrary to what Georges Pompidou once recommended. Or transform the music festival into Elysian gay pride. Or to deplore the fact that we spend “crazy dough” on social spending. Or to affirm that it is enough to ""cross the street"" to find a job. Poor bastards!"
2399	15	A breakthrough strategy
2399	17	"By affirming loud and clear his desire to piss off the French ""to the end"", even though the latter do not commit any offense since it seems that vaccination is not compulsory, Emmanuel Macron also demonstrates that his strategy ("" that's the strategy” he says in rough French) is based on the permanent division of the population. A breakthrough strategy. A civil war strategy."
2399	19	Divide and conquer, the formula is old, but it becomes the mantra of macronie.
2399	21	The power indeed excels in finding divisive subjects, intended to sow discord in our country. Today, it is a question of pillorying the non-vaccinated or now the non-completely-vaccinated. To make people forget the disastrous effects of the neo-liberal deconstruction of the public hospital[1]. To also divert attention from the fact that the all-vaccine strategy clearly has less and less influence on new variants and that we end up with Big Pharma stocks that must be sold at all costs.
2399	23	No limits
2399	25	But what exactly do we find at the end of the end of the presidential hassle?
2399	27	The ban on voting, the suspension of social rights as in Canada, the refusal of care as advocated by a “professor” Grimaldi, prison, lynching…? The official hostility against the unvaccinated clearly no longer has any limits, as evidenced by the increasingly mind-boggling statements we hear in the official media. In macronie, madness like hate is as communicative as Omicron!
2399	29	And we can't help but wonder who will get on the next Macronian cart. The sovereignists? The voters of Marine Le Pen or Éric Zemmour? The Catholics ? Those who don't believe Greta Thunberg is the new messiah?
2399	31	The totalitarian turn of macronie
2399	33	As Solzhenitsyn warned, lies sooner or later lead to violence. Verbal violence first and then violence plain and simple.
2399	35	Since the start of the Covid crisis, the government has accumulated lies, contradictions and has only sown fear in the population. It is therefore inevitable that he becomes violent.
2399	37	Western post-democracies are sinking a little deeper into a new totalitarianism every day. In France as elsewhere.
2399	39	The violence of the Macronian police against the Yellow Vests has been emulated in Europe. In the Netherlands, police have fired bullets at protesters opposed to health policy and attack dogs are now being used against opponents.
2399	41	Everywhere the oligarchy no longer hesitates to piss off the Europeans in an increasingly aggressive way.
2399	43	We then begin to dream of a presidential election where the voters would give back to the pain in the ass…
