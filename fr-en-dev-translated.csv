231	1	How Macron and his clique tamper with unemployment figures
231	3	"As if by chance, a few days before a second round when Marine Le Pen suddenly became a Nazi again, the unemployment figures miraculously fell by 600,000, nothing less, and the media collaborated to rave again about our ""Mozart of the economy"" who has served as our president for five years. Except that…"
231	4	Here is a quick explanation of how INSEE, on the orders of Macron and his clique, fakes and falsifies the real unemployment figures.
231	5	"You should know that INSEE produces its figures by carrying out a survey of only 110,000 people (while the active population is 29 million people in France!) then by making ""corrections"" (which they call "" weights”) obscure, to produce the final figure."
231	6	However, in 2021, INSEE changed its survey and its weighting:
231	7	The Employment Survey is being revamped in 2021: from the reasons for its overhaul to the impacts on the measurement of employment and unemployment (INSEE ANALYSES, No 65, 06/29/2021)
231	8	https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/5402123
231	9	"In the middle of this article, INSEE reveals that this new version has ""magically"" increased the employment rate of 15-64 year olds by 0.8% all at once (which corresponds to 270,000 more people in employment). ), and that of women by 1.4%! In short, we change the questionnaire and the weighting, and hop, the employment rate increases, so the unemployment rate drops!"
231	10	It should be remembered that the increasingly significant discrepancy between the figures of INSEE (used by the government and the media) and those of Pôle Emploi has been known for years:
231	11	Unemployment: why the figures from INSEE and Pôle emploi differ 24-08-17
231	12	https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/08/24/chomage-pourquoi-les-chiffres-de-l-insee-et-de-pole-emploi-different_5176176_4355770.html
231	13	Excerpt from this article:
231	14	“In 2013, INSEE changed the questionnaires for its employment survey. After the marginal reformulation of certain questions, the answers were profoundly modified. Thus, an INSEE interviewer will no longer ask you if you were “looking for a job, even part-time or casual”, but if you were “looking for a job” period.
231	15	Combined with others, this modification was enough to tip a few “yes” on the side of “no”. The Institute's experts estimated in March 2014 that the new questionnaire had artificially lowered the unemployment rate by 0.5 points, i.e. 145,000 fewer unemployed people. »
231	16	In short: the unemployment figures are faked!
231	17	"And that, not to mention that in September 2021, the State ordered the SNCF to hire en masse ""young people"" in HR (Human Relations) jobs, that is to say jobs useless, created to artificially lower the number of unemployed, by further indebting the SNCF. This information was given to me in person by the director of an important branch of the SNCF network, at the beginning of October; she was shocked by this request from the government."
231	18	It is likely that other public companies have received such an order.
231	19	While Macron and his clique falsify reality, the French economy declines even more.
23104	1	"""The European Union's climate strategy is set to increase deforestation on a global scale"""
23104	3	"In a column in the ""World"", three scientists, Denis Couvet, Wolfgang Cramer and Timothy Searchinger, warn about the EU's climate policy, which intends to devote 20% of cultivated land to bioenergy, and to increase imports of wood."
23104	5	To avoid catastrophic climate change and biodiversity loss, climate science warns us that humanity must stop turning forests into agricultural land, as this process releases carbon dioxide and destroys habitats. Yet as the world's population, incomes, and meat consumption grow, agricultural land is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. Europe has contributed to this deforestation by outsourcing its supply of food and other agricultural products.
23104	7	Unfortunately, the European Union's 'Fit for 55' [legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%] climate strategy is set to extend Europe's footprint and increasing deforestation globally. This is why a group of scientists from all over Europe are calling on the European Parliament to modify the plan with reasonable amendments (some have already been adopted by one of its committees).
23104	9	Vast amounts of productive land
23104	11	The plan aims to dedicate one-fifth of Europe's cropland to bioenergy by 2050. Imports of firewood for energy production will also quadruple, an annual volume roughly equivalent to 40% of the entire annual timber harvest in Canada, the second largest timber exporter in the world.
23104	13	Harvesting and burning more trees increases the amount of carbon in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries. This is true even if trees are allowed to grow back and even if wood replaces coal (the dirtiest fuel used for energy).
23104	15	"The central problem stems from a systemic error in siled thinking: the plan ignores the effects of bioenergy production for the climate and nature. Burning biomass releases more carbon than burning fossil fuels, but these emissions are ignored. The theory goes that this carbon is removed from the air as plants grow, so burning plants does not add ""net"" carbon to the air."
23105	1	Covid variants: restart or seasonal virus?
23105	3	With the arrival and the very majority circulation of BA.4 and BA.5 on French territory, the number of contaminations is on the rise again. How to analyze this recovery? Responses from epidemiologists Catherine Hill and Antoine Flahault.
23105	5	The epidemic is not seasonal. More and more contagious variants follow one another and continue to circulate the virus in waves.
23105	7	Catherine Hill Epidemiologist at the Gustave-Roussy Institute (Villejuif)
23105	9	If some think that the Covid epidemic is seasonal, it is probably by analogy with flu epidemics. But it is enough to look at the evolution of Covid mortality in the countries of the northern hemisphere and in the countries of the southern hemisphere to see that the peaks observed in the North do not correspond to the troughs observed in the South. We can also compare the dates of the peaks between two countries located in the same hemisphere, for example South Africa and Brazil, to see that in Brazil the largest peak occurred in mid-April 2021, when there were very few deaths in South Africa.
23105	11	There were three peaks in Brazil, in July 2020, April 2021 and February 2022, and four peaks in South Africa, in August 2020, January 2021, July 2021 and February 2022. In France, there were seven peaks, in April 2020, November 2020, February 2021, March 2021, August 2021, February 2022, and April 2022, so in all seasons.
23105	13	The epidemic is actually governed by the spread of increasingly contagious variants that spread from one country to another depending on the movement of people. Thus, the BA.2 variant of Omicron quickly became dominant in France, succeeding the BA.1 variant of Omicron, which itself succeeded the Delta variant.
23105	15	The BA.4 and BA.5 variants of Omicron are arriving in France, they already accounted for 46% of viruses from June 5 to 11 according to screening data, and their relative frequency is increasing rapidly. We went from 45% BA.2 to 75% BA.2 in two weeks, so we can expect to have 75% BA.4 or BA.5 soon.
23105	17	Can we then speak of recovery? Restart implies stopping, but there has been no stopping of the epidemic: as in the rest of the world, Sars-CoV-2 has never stopped circulating in France. The evolution of this circulation can be studied from several indicators: the number of positive cases, the number of patients arriving at the hospital or in intensive care and the number of deaths.
23105	19	Whatever the indicator, the circulation of the virus took place in successive waves, with highs and lows, the highs becoming less and less high because the population is partly protected from the risks by vaccination or by a previous infection, the protection being better against the most serious risks, that is to say the risks of admission to intensive care and the risks of death.
23105	21	However, the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, which arrived in Portugal earlier than in France, are associated in this country with a significant increase in mortality.
23105	23	We can therefore expect to observe the same phenomenon in France, or even worse insofar as 11% of the French population aged 80 and over has not been vaccinated at all, whereas in Portugal the vaccination coverage of population aged 60 and over is 100%.
23105	25	We are not done with the pandemic. The current wave which, after having touched Portugal, is sweeping over Europe bears witness to a restart.
23105	27	Antoine Flahault Epidemiologist, Director of the Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva (Switzerland)
23105	29	At the end of each wave, the voices of experts and politicians rise to explain, in a very optimistic tone, that this time it is all over. Let's remember the first wave, after the terrible first confinement. After the summer when we had found life almost “as before”, the second wave required another confinement. We then hoped, thanks to the good news concerning the arrival of a vaccine, that we would have finished with this pandemic. But the Alpha variant was going to thwart the plans of our favorite reassurances and require a new containment, which this time would be the last.
23105	31	But does this mean that we were done with the pandemic since June 2021? Unfortunately, the Delta wave has spread over Europe and around the world. The vaccine would change that. As we emerged in early December from what was to be our last experience with this pandemic, we saw the new Omicron variant surge in South Africa, at the start of their austral summer. It was so transmissible that nothing stopped it and hardly had we reached the peak of the Delta wave, in mid-December, that Omicron was going to spread over all of Europe without giving us the slightest respite.
23105	33	"Omicron is a large family and each of the sub-variants has its own character. BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5. Do not believe that there would be ""only"" five children in the Omicron family. North Americans today struggle with a subvariant that is called BA.2.12.1, meaning that the BA.2 subvariant once had at least 12 subvariants. It is breaking out in Martinique, which is currently experiencing the highest incidences and deaths reported to the population."
23105	35	So no, we are not done with the Covid. We would like to, but the waves rather seem to follow one another at an accelerated pace.
23105	37	It looks like BA.5 is leading the race in Western Europe. The wave caused in Portugal – and its procession of deaths – now extends to the sub-continent and in particular to metropolitan France. The Portuguese are however remarkably vaccinated, they still wear the mask on public transport, so there is little reason to think that the French will fare better. It is important to note that 93% of the mortality during this BA.5 wave in Portugal concerned people over the age of 80. They are the ones who must be protected as a very high priority, the remaining 7% were the rare unvaccinated or insufficiently vaccinated people, people immunocompromised by their treatments or their diseases.
23105	39	"So, if you want to call this virus ""seasonal"", that's up to you, but what season are we talking about? Wasn't this expression used in the past for influenza viruses and winter colds? If we look at the Covid of the last twelve months, it is rather the four seasons that this virus and its orchestra of sub-variants have played on us: I would therefore say rather a restart, you have understood it!"
23109	1	Right to abortion threatened in the United States: send them the stick in the face
23109	3	They will never leave women alone. The Supreme Court of the United States is preparing to overturn the historic judgment recognizing, for nearly half a century, the right to abortion. The leaked project is to be taken very seriously: we do not see how it could not be confirmed by this court with a clear conservative majority since the remodeling carried out by Donald Trump.
23109	5	"The fundamental right of women to terminate a pregnancy in the so-called country ""of the free"" can therefore be called into question. Women will be subject to the goodwill of the state in which they live and almost half of them are ready to tackle abortion. Not less. However, Simone de Beauvoir had warned us: “Never forget that all it takes is a political, economic or religious crisis for women's rights to be called into question. These rights are never acquired. You will have to remain vigilant throughout your life.” American women put forward the theory of the backlash: each advance in women's rights has been followed by a reactionary offensive, demonstrated in 1991 the feminist journalist Susan Faludi in an essay that is still relevant today."
23109	7	The backlash, feminists have been waiting for it since MeToo in 2017. Here it is. But can't we throw it back in their face? Between resilience and resistance, which word do we prefer? We will have to defend our rights at the ballot box. Joe Biden called for it, as early as the midterm elections in November. We will have to defend our rights in the street. As of Monday evening, hundreds of demonstrators massed in front of the temple of American law, facing the “pro-lifers”. They will have to be defended alongside associations whose importance is obvious in the face of such news. Reinstalling this balance of power is an imperative, in the United States, in Europe also where Ukrainian women victims of rape are currently prevented from having access to abortion in Poland, but also elsewhere, everywhere.
23109	9	They will never leave women alone. But we will never let them go back quietly.
2311	1	“Conference on the future of Europe: a sham of participatory democracy?”
2311	3	If there is one lesson to be learned from the Conference on the Future of Europe which has just concluded, it is that, whatever the circumstances (wars, health crises, economic slumps or calamitous precedents), there there will always be a handful of die-hards for whom the salvation of the continent depends only on a long and winding reform of the treaties. When, moreover, these diehards concoct and steer a tailor-made consultation by draping it in the tinsel of a vast “citizen consultation” which (oh surprise!) endorses their political objectives, then we are bordering on deception. And we run the risk of bogging down Europe in Byzantine debates and endless ratifications at the most inopportune moment possible.
2311	5	Through communicative sleight of hand, this Conference is now presented as a cry from the heart of European citizens which resulted in a clear mandate to reform Europe from top to bottom and integrate it further. When in fact it is not. From the outset, this consultation almost did not see the light of day. Originally, this idea was pushed relentlessly by Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian Prime Minister and avowed federalist. He and his group (Renew, where the members of the République en Marche also sit) made it one of the conditions for the election of Ursula von der Leyen, and she acceded to it, between the annoyance and the indifference of Member States. A few months later, the Covid reshuffled all the cards and this conference, contrary to the emergencies and the needs of the crisis, lost all its interest... except for Parliament, which did not budge. The compromise was therefore to launch a one-year consultation open to all Europeans and whose contributions would be channeled through a virtual platform and citizens' groups.
23112	3	"It is a summit largely devoted to Ukraine, but also to other subjects, such as China and the climate. The seven G7 powers, meeting at a summit in Bavaria, Germany, want Russia to pay the maximum cost for its invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country is presiding this year, said on Tuesday June 28. the G7, reaffirming that ""Putin must not win this war""."
23112	5	"The G7 remains united in its support for Ukraine, Olaf Scholz told a press conference after the G7 leaders' summit. ""We will continue to maintain and increase the economic and political costs of this war for President (Vladimir) Putin and his regime,"" he added."
23112	7	"The seven G7 powers also pledged on Tuesday after their meeting to ""support"" the ""reconstruction of Ukraine through an international conference and reconstruction plan"", according to a draft of final declaration consulted by AFP. The G7, joined by five emerging countries, including India, also condemned Russia's ""illegal"" invasion of Ukraine."
23112	9	"For his part, Emmanuel Macron considered that ""Russia cannot and must not win"" the war in Ukraine. ""Russia cannot and must not win and therefore our support for Ukraine and our sanctions against Russia will continue for as long as necessary and with the necessary intensity over the coming weeks and months,"" he said. said at a press conference after the summit."
23112	11	"The creation of a ""climate club"""
23112	13	"In addition, the leaders of the G7 have agreed on the creation of a ""climate club"" intended to strengthen and broaden cooperation in the fight against global warming, according to a joint declaration published on Tuesday at the end of their summit in Germany. This climate club will be an ""intergovernmental forum of great ambition"" open to all countries, explain the seven leaders. ""We invite our partners, including major emitters, G20 members and other developing and emerging economies, to intensify discussions and consultations with us,"" the statement continued."
23112	15	This body, led by Germany, aims in particular to bring together countries accepting common rules to avoid competitive disadvantages. These countries would jointly set ambitious targets and exempt each other from climate-related trade tariffs to which non-members would be subject. This would include agreeing carbon pricing standards or uniform regulations for green hydrogen.
23112	17	"G7 leaders also accused China on Tuesday of ""practices that distort the global economy"" and said they wanted to cooperate in sharing information on such actions taken by Beijing. ""With regard to China's role in the global economy, we continue to consult on collective approaches, also beyond the G7, to address the challenges posed by non-market policies and practices that distort the economy. world"", they declared in their final press release after a summit where they denounced ""non-transparent and distorting interventions in the Chinese market""."
23112	19	About $14 billion against food insecurity
23112	21	"The seven G7 powers have urged countries and companies with ""large food stocks"" to help ease the food shortage and pledge an additional $4.5 billion to tackle food insecurity."
23112	23	As a short-term remedy, we call on partners who have large stocks of food, as well as the private sector, to make food available without distorting markets, including by supporting the World Food Program's procurement strategy. in a statement by the G7. G7 leaders are also pledging an additional $4.5 billion to address food insecurity, bringing the effort this year to around $14 billion, according to the statement.
23112	25	"The G7 also reiterated its ""urgent call on Russia to end, unconditionally, the blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the destruction of essential port and transport infrastructure, silos and grain terminals, to the illegal appropriation by Russia of agricultural products and equipment in Ukraine and to all other activities that hinder the production and export of production and Ukrainian exports of foodstuffs"". ""These actions can only be seen as a geopolitically motivated attack on global food security,"" the G7 said."
23112	27	The Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the blockade of Black Sea ports, is driving up food prices and contributing to the global spike in inflation. Russia, for its part, denies having blocked the passage of cargo ships and accuses Western sanctions of contributing to the food crisis.
23112	29	After the G7, several heads of state, including Emmanuel Macron, are expected in Madrid for a NATO summit, which takes place from June 28 to 30.
23116	1	In France, guaranteeing abortion without shaking
23116	3	"""I don't think the Supreme Court will ever come back to Roe v. Wade”, declared in 2015 the progressive judge of the institution Ruth Bader Ginsburg, since deceased. However, this is what happened on Friday, when the federal right to abortion was buried by the same Supreme Court. It is always difficult to think of the worst, and that is why democratic countries have a Constitution."
23116	5	This Saturday, the leader of LREM deputies, Aurore Bergé, therefore tabled a constitutional bill to protect access to abortion. Coming from the presidential party and immediately supported by the Prime Minister, Elisabeth Borne, this declaration can make people cringe since LREM had refused in 2018 to register this right when it had been proposed by La France insoumise. Political maneuver then, but what does it matter? The key is to muster the necessary majority in both Houses of Parliament before opponents of women's human rights wake up.
23116	7	"They never sleep, as can be seen from their first reactions this weekend. “I am not for it”, thus declared on BFM TV the president of Modem, François Bayrou, finding “surprising” that what is happening in the United States leads to “effervescent reactions in French political life”. However, this was not his reaction in 1998 to the Monica Lewinsky affair: ""We say:"" It's America! but no democracy is immune to it,” he warned. Same story with Senator LR Bruno Retailleau, accusing the majority of inventing “fictitious problems”. Joining the conservatives, the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut warned this Sunday on Europe 1 of an unexpected strengthening of women's rights, because ""one should only touch the Constitution with a trembling hand"". In 1992, Finkielkraut was part of a group that fought a fierce battle to add an anti-Franglais amendment to the Constitution, with none of his hands shaking. It is now up to the forces of social progress not to tremble."
23119	1	Ukraine: it's no longer a war, it's a butchery
23119	3	We cannot emphasize enough the essential role of war photoreporters who alone make it possible to document the horror, and who moreover have paid a heavy price for this conflict in Ukraine. Sunday, their images looped on the media around the world, attesting to the way in which the Russian military seems to have behaved in the Ukrainian localities liberated after several weeks of occupation. It's no longer a war, it's a butchery. Men executed with their hands behind their backs, women raped then burned, bodies crushed by tanks… The list is long of the abuses that the Russians seem to have committed.
23119	5	Of course, you have to be careful. Since the affair of the true-false mass graves in the Romanian city of Timisoara, in 1989, we know that we must be wary of emotion and images taken on the spot. Investigative work will determine the exact nature of the Russian crimes perpetrated in Ukraine. And if it turns out that tens, hundreds or even thousands of inhabitants of Ukrainian localities controlled by the Russian army were executed with a bullet in the neck or raped, it will be necessary not only to testify in front of the international justice, but also to pass to the top speed of the sanctions.
23119	7	On Sunday, Western condemnations were almost unanimous, suggesting stronger economic reprisals. Yes, it will require sacrifices on our part, but don't these images make them unavoidable? History may be dotted with massacres, but it is still difficult to understand how men can unleash themselves like furious beasts on those who, the day before, were considered brothers or cousins. Vladimir Putin bears a crushing responsibility in this situation, he who heated up, manipulated and then unleashed his men on Ukraine, but also all those around him who know the extent of disinformation and remain silent for fear of reprisals. They need to know that they will pay the price one day.
2312	1	"Climate, the great global manipulation: The twelve lies of the IPCC and ""the ecological religion"""
2312	3	"COP 26 did not end in Glasgow as planned. Its President, the Briton Alok Sharma, had insisted that it was necessary to ""put coal in the history books"", specifying: ""we must stop using coal, and also stop all subsidies to fossil fuels...""."
2312	5	"Everything seemed settled for an uneventful vote, when on Saturday, November 13, an hour before the closing of the conference, an unprecedented event occurred. The representative of India, its Minister of the Environment Bhupender Yadav, declared that his country did not accept the planned wording and proposed another wording as follows: ""We must move towards clean technologies, including by intensifying efforts to phase out coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies…”. The Indian Minister then argued that China supported India's suggestion. Official projections from these countries show that global CO2 emissions will inexorably continue to grow."
23127	3	Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a delegation of security officials traveled to their country's border on Thursday to mark the completion of a 300 km steel wall along the border with Belarus.
23127	5	In remarks to reporters, Morawiecki used tricks to distract liberals from Poland's selective approach to immigration, which welcomes Ukrainians while rejecting Syrians :
23127	7	“The first sign of the war in Ukraine was the attack of (Belarusian President) Alexander Lukashenko on the Polish border with Belarus. It is thanks to (our) political foresight and anticipation of what might happen that we can now focus on helping Ukraine, which is fighting to protect its sovereignty,” he said. to journalists.
23127	9	Belarus supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, including allowing Russian forces to use Belarusian territory.
23127	11	Lukashenko's 'attack' on Poland took the form of militarized migration, with his government encouraging migrants from the Middle East to come to Belarus and then attempt to enter the European Union through the country's borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The move was seen as a new form of retaliation for EU sanctions against Belarus over its treatment of dissidents.
23127	13	Thousands of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Africa poured into Belarus and made their way to the Polish border, where they endured freezing cold in their quest to cross the border. Sometimes the situation gave rise to major clashes. In November, hundreds of migrants pushed towards the border near the Polish village of Kuznica and tried to undo a barbed wire fence with shovels and other tools.
23127	15	“This is part of the inhuman approach of the Lukashenko regime, which consists of lying to people, abusing them (…) and bringing them to Belarus with the promise of easy entry into the European Union. said an EU spokesperson at the time.
23127	17	"Human rights groups have accused both countries of mistreating migrants. According to the Associated Press, at least 20 people have died in the ""icy forests and bogs"" of the border area."
23127	19	Along with the completion of the wall, the Polish government lifted an emergency declaration that banned journalists and human rights activists from observing the situation along the border.
23127	21	Activists have criticized the Polish government for simultaneously taking in mostly white, Christian and female refugees from Ukraine while refusing mostly Muslim male migrants from elsewhere.
23127	23	“If you give a refugee a lift at the Ukrainian border, you are a hero. If you do it at the Belarusian border, you are a smuggler and you can end up in prison for eight years,” Natalia Gebert, founder of a Polish nongovernmental organization that helps refugees, told AP.
23127	25	"Meanwhile, in another sign of tension between Warsaw and Minsk, the Polish government on Thursday accused Belarus of fostering an ""atmosphere of acquiescence"" to vandalism against Polish graves, Reuters reports:"
23127	27	The Polish Foreign Ministry said unknown persons had recently damaged Polish tombstones and memorials in several places, mainly in Western Belarus, which was part of Poland before World War II and where many Polish soldiers are buried. .
23127	29	The wave of Ukrainian immigration is wreaking havoc in the EU, as evidenced by unemployment figures for Germany released on Thursday. Analysts had expected the number of unemployed to fall by 5,000, but it jumped by 133,000.
23131	3	Some are often bristled or even outraged by Macron's anti-French statements and undue tributes to Algeria, its history... such as the unacceptable work of Benjamin Stora, being only a charge against France.
23131	5	In fact, it would not be about ideology. It would simply be repeated thanks to the Algerian regime for having financed its first campaign, probably in cash… We are talking about 18 million euros… The oligarchs surrounding Bouteflika are now in prison, however the Minister of Foreign Affairs survives, who, like Le Drian, has passed from one president to another... Ramtane Lamara never fails to castigate Macron when he begins to disobey and Foutriquet to ask for forgiveness...
23131	7	"So in February 2017, in the middle of the presidential campaign, Emmanuel Macron went to Algiers. But instead of meeting representatives of civil society, he is content to see officials and, more discreetly, businessmen close to power and qualifies French colonization as a crime against humanity... From then on, he will constantly support the regime , even at the height of the ""Hirak"", when thirteen million Algerians marched throughout Algeria against a fifth term for the old president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Would Emmanuel Macron have offered his protection to a corrupt and discredited military regime, in exchange for financial support?"
23131	9	"This documentary, episode n°6 of the series ""Emmanuel Macron, a businessman at the Élysée"" by Off Investigation, a new left-wing media, does nothing for Foutriquet and puts a number of revelations into perspective, with guest star Alexandre Benalla."

23135	1	The UN keeps its defender of LGBTQI + rights despite the hostility of Muslim countries
23135	3	The mission of the defender of the rights of LGBTQI + minorities to the United Nations was contested by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which defends the interests of Muslim countries at the UN.
23135	5	An important result, welcomed AFP Victor Madrigal-Borloz, who has held the position since 2017. The defender of the rights of LGBTQI + minorities at the United Nations narrowly obtained the renewal of his mandate, despite the fierce fight of a group of Muslim countries in all UN arenas. Its mission, created in 2016, was renewed last week in Geneva by the Human Rights Council, for an additional three years.
23135	7	Read also: Faced with the neo-reactionary offensive in the world, reaffirm human rights diplomacy
23135	9	"The protection of the rights of sexual and gender minorities is a regular subject of debate at the UN, due to the fierce opposition of certain countries which question the existence of the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, pointed out as contrary to their traditional values ​​and as an obstacle to the universality of human rights. Despite campaign involving ""over 1,100"" LGBTQI+ organizations from 174 countries and ""political support"" from dozens of states, rights advocate says reappointment has faced hostility from Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which defends the interests of Muslim countries at the UN. A group of African and Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Egypt, specifically objected to the use of the terms ""sexual orientation"", ""transgender"" and ""men who have sex with men"". . ""We cannot support efforts to invent new rights on the basis of personal sexual preferences,"" Pakistani Ambassador Khalil Hashmi pleaded to the Human Rights Council, on behalf of 56 states which, except Albania , are all OIC members."
23135	11	The pretext of specific values
23135	13	"Response from French Ambassador Jérôme Bonnafont: “Too many countries hide behind the pretext of specific values ​​to maintain discriminatory legislation”. By 23 votes to 17 – Malawi, Eritrea and China joining 14 Muslim countries – the Council finally approved the renewal, after rejecting several amendments aimed at restricting its scope, sometimes with only one vote difference. ""The international community continues to understand the extent of violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or gender diverse people"", welcomed Victor Madrigal-Borloz, castigating ""a very regrettable political position"" of the opposing countries to its mission: ""The discourse of these States (...) constitutes a rejection of their fundamental international human rights obligations: the protection of the peoples under their authority, and of their own nationals, against human rights violations"" ."

23138	1	The American state is destroying the 4th of July
23138	3	By Dan Sanchez.
23138	5	It looks like the struggling US economy will put a damper on 4th of July celebrations this year.
23138	7	The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday:
23138	9	“Throughout America, the 4th of July fireworks will not be set off on the 4th of July. »
23138	11	Some cities and towns are rescheduling their Independence Day fireworks shows due to a shortage of fireworks or workers.
23138	13	And as many media reveal, meals will be much more expensive than last year. The Washington Examiner reports:
23138	15	“The cost of a July 4 barbecue is expected to be 17% higher than last year, according to a market basket survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. This is a figure that exceeds general inflation, since prices are on average 8.6% higher than a year ago, according to the consumer price index. It also represents a major reversal from the small party savings that the Biden White House shamefully touted in 2021 – drawing ridicule from commentators. »
23138	17	It will be harder to celebrate America's birthday when the American dream is on a tightrope. But it will be a good time to reflect on how we got into this predicament.
23138	19	"July 4 is America's Independence Day. It marks our separation from the British Empire: a state which, through ""a long train of abuses and usurpations"" (in the words of our Declaration of Independence), had proved destructive of the individual rights of Americans. . According to the classic liberal creed of America's founders, this was unacceptable, because the only legitimate purpose of a state is to protect the individual rights of the governed."
23138	21	Today, the American state tramples on the rights of Americans to such an extent that the former British rulers seem benevolent in comparison. Especially since the rise of Covid-19, state attacks on freedom and property have turned into an all-out war on production and therefore on our livelihoods.
23138	23	They shut down huge swathes of the economy and locked millions of families in their homes.
23138	25	A massive expansion in public spending shifted much of the country's wealth from private to public control.
23138	27	The Federal Reserve has waged a war on saving and sound investment, and therefore a war on sustainable capital formation.
23138	29	The Biden administration has discouraged labor with stimulus spending and strangled energy production with regulations.
23138	31	And by using our tax money to drag the entire western world into a global economic war with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, the US government has made a terrible and lasting situation worse: it has caused the collapse of trade in food and energy supplies.
23138	33	"As Elon Musk warned in 2020, ""If you don't make anything, there's nothing."" If you prohibit entrepreneurs from opening shops and workers from going to work, there will be less goods. If you ban domestic industries from importing food and fuel, there will be less food and fuel. If you don't have enough energy to produce transportation consumer goods, there will be less consumer goods. Etc."
23138	35	No amount of stimulus financed by Federal Reserve money creation will change that. An electric shock will not make a prisoner work harder if he is handcuffed. Nor can you stimulate an economy chained to prosperity.
23138	37	Now, as an inescapable result, there are far more Federal Reserve Notes for far fewer goods than there otherwise would have been. And that's why the prices are going up.
23138	39	But they're probably not rising as much as they should to fully reflect greater scarcity, due to the ongoing threat of a crackdown on price gouging (as economist Walter Block recently argued here on FEE.org ). And this is one of the main reasons why there are chronic and widespread shortages.
23138	41	Americans have betrayed the legacy of our founding fathers by surrendering the rights they fought for to a tyranny far worse than the one they overthrew, for the false promise of abundance, security and health provided by the 'State. This is why, on this Independence Day, they have less freedom to celebrate and, therefore, less goods and services to do so.
23138	43	To truly honor the founding of America, Americans should begin to act like Americans, declare their independence as individuals, and claim their freedom to cooperate with each other to produce, provide, and prosper.

23148	5	Western countries must stop supporting the losing Ukraine and bring it to the negotiating table with Russia, in order to avoid the most serious consequences of the confrontation with Russia, writes the columnist of the Italian publication il Giornale Gian Mikalessin .
23148	7	The columnist claims that NATO countries doubted whether they should support Ukraine “as much as necessary” after the capture of Lisichansk by the allied forces of the Russian Federation and the LPR. Mikalessin believes that the Ukrainian armed forces cannot be compared with Russian troops.

He recalled the technical complexity of NATO weapons, which the Ukrainians are not able to serve.

Thus, according to JP Morgan forecasts, in the fall, the price of a barrel of oil could reach 380 dollars.

23152	1	Joe Biden and the Saudi Despots: A Very Revealing Submission
23152	3	"Joe Biden's immediate abandonment of his 2020 vow to make Saudis ""outcasts"", and his growing support for the regime, show the fundamental deception of American propaganda."
23152	5	Translated by the readers of the Les-Crises website
23152	7	"In 2018, President Trump issued a statement reaffirming the United States' longstanding relationship with the Saudi royal family, on the grounds that this partnership serves America's ""national interests."" Trump specifically cited the fact that ""Saudi Arabia is the largest oil-producing nation in the world"" and that it has purchased hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons from American arms manufacturers. Trump's statement was released following widespread demands in Washington that Trump reduce or even sever ties with the Saudi regime over the likely role played by its Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, in the brutal killing of the Saudi Arabian regime. Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi."
23152	9	What made these Trump-era demands somewhat odd was that Khashoggi's killing wasn't exactly the first time the Saudi regime had violated human rights and committed atrocities of virtually every kind. For decades, the arbitrary imprisonment and murder of Saudi dissidents, journalists and activists has been commonplace, not to mention the US- and UK-backed devastation of Yemen that began during the Obama years. . All of this took place as post-World War II American presidents made the deep and close partnership between Washington and the tyrants of Riyadh a staple of American policy in the Middle East.
23152	11	"Yet, as was typical of the Trump years, political and media commentators treated Trump's decision to maintain relations with the Saudis as if it were an unprecedented aberration of the evil he alone pioneered. — a radical departure from long-held bipartisan American values ​​— rather than what it was: namely, the pursuit of standard bipartisan American politics for decades. In an outraged op-ed following Trump's statement, The New York Times exclaimed that Trump was making the world ""more [dangerous] by emboldening despots in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere"", specifically blaming ""Trump's opinion according to that all relationships are transactional and that moral or human rights considerations must be sacrificed to a basic understanding of US national interests. »"
23152	13	"The lifelong Eurocrat, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, lamented what he described as Trump's worldview: ""If you buy American weapons and you are against Iran - then you can kill and suppress as much as you want. CNN published an analysis by Stephen Collinson, White House reporter for the channel, under the title: “Saudi support for Trump highlights the brutality of the America First doctrine” – which thundered: “By refusing to break with Saudi strongman Mohammed bin Salman on the Saudi consulate shooting in Istanbul, Trump has effectively told global despots that if they side with him, Washington will turn a blind eye to actions that violate the traditional values ​​of United States. Trump's willingness to do business with the Saudis, Collinson argued, ""represented another blow to the international rule of law and global accountability, concepts that Trump has shown little desire to uphold in nearly two years in office. »"
23152	15	Perhaps the most vocal in criticizing Trump's continued drive to maintain ties with the Saudi regime were then-Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. As a recent CNN compilation of these statements demonstrates: “In the years before they took office, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and many senior officials in their administration were harshly critical of the lack of action of President Donald Trump against Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. »
23152	17	"During a 2019 Democratic primary debate, Biden swore, “We were actually going to make them pay the price, and actually make them the outcasts that they are” (sic), adding that there has “very little social redemption value in the current government in Saudi Arabia. Harris similarly slammed Trump for his ongoing relationship with the Saudis, complaining on Twitter in October 2019 that ""Trump has yet to hold Saudi officials accountable,"" adding, ""Unacceptable: America needs to make it clear that violence towards critics and the press will not be tolerated. »"
23152	19	That Joe Biden was posing as some sort of human rights crusader who would cut ties with the despotic regimes that have long been among America's dearest partners was inherently farcical. As Obama's vice president, Biden played a central role in the foreign policy of that administration, which embraced the world's most barbaric tyrants. Obama was so dedicated to the United States' longstanding partnership with Riyadh that in 2015 he deeply offended India - the world's largest democracy - by abruptly cutting off his visit there to fly to India. Saudi Arabia, along with leaders of both US political parties, to pay tribute to Saudi King Abdullah on his death. To add insult to injury, Obama, as the Guardian put it, boarded his plane for Riyadh “just hours after lecturing in India on religious tolerance and women’s rights. »
23152	21	"The White House's unwavering support under Obama/Biden for the Saudi regime has not been limited to obsequious gestures like these. Their dedication to strengthening the despotic Saudi ruling family was far more important – and deadly. The Obama administration played a vital role in promoting the Saudi attack on Yemen, which has spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In order to appease the Saudis over its deal with Iran, ""the Obama administration has offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons, other military equipment and training, the highest of any U.S. administration in the U.S.-Saudi alliance for 71 years,” Reuters reported in late 2016, months before Obama and Biden left office."
23152	23	Beyond the huge stockpile of sophisticated weapons that Obama/Biden transferred to the Saudis to use against Yemen and anyone they chose to target, Snowden's records revealed that Obama ordered a significant increase in the amount and type of intelligence technology as well as raw intelligence provided by the NSA to the Saudi regime. This intelligence was – and still is – used by Saudi autocrats not only to identify bombing targets in Yemen, but also to subject their own population to close, virtually ubiquitous surveillance: a regime of control used to brutally suppress any dissent or opposition to the Saudi regime.
23152	25	In sum, it is no exaggeration that the White House under Obama/Biden – along with their junior British counterparts – have been singularly responsible for the Saudi regime's ability to survive and wage this devastating war in Yemen. But this is nothing new. The centerpiece of US policy in the Middle East for decades has been to prop up Saudi despots with weapons and diplomatic protection in exchange for the Saudis serving US interests with their oil supply and guaranteeing the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency in the oil market.
23152	27	This is what made the hysterical reaction to Trump's reaffirmation of this relationship so absurd and deliberately misleading. Trump was not savagely deviating from American politics by embracing Saudi bullies, but simply continuing the longstanding American policy of supporting all sorts of savage despots around the world whenever it advanced American interests. US presidents are not supposed to explicitly admit that they overlook human rights abuses of their allies because of the benefits of this relationship, even though this amoral and self-serving approach is and has been for decades one of the premises ideologies of bipartisan American foreign policy.
23152	29	Beyond the Saudi example, the same thing could be observed when Trump welcomed the brutal Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House; the mainstream commentary saw it as a kind of shocking violation of fundamental American principles.
23152	31	"In fact, the United States has been the greatest benefactor of Egyptian tyranny for decades. They armed and supported the Mubarak regime until it was overthrown. Obama's Secretary of State John Kerry has praised General Sisi's military coup against the nation's first democratically elected leader as an attempt to protect democracy. And shortly before the start of the Arab Spring, Hillary Clinton, succeeding Kerry, declared her personal affection for the predecessor of Sisi, the monstrous dictator who ruled Egypt for three decades: ""I really consider the President and Mrs Mubarak as friends of my family, so I hope to see him often here in Egypt and in the United States,” she exclaimed in 2009, as Obama ensured that the flow of money and weapons to Mubarak never stops."
23152	33	While the bipartisan political and media class has spent decades insisting, and still insists, that the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy is to uphold freedom and democracy and fight tyranny around the world , the indisputable reality is the exact opposite: supporting the most brutal dictators on the planet who serve US interests has been a staple of US foreign policy since at least the end of World War II. What determines whether the United States supports or opposes a foreign country is not whether it is democratic or despotic, but whether it is deferential.
23152	35	"Thus, it was not Trump's embrace of long-standing American partnerships with Saudi and Egyptian despots that represented a radical departure from American tradition. The radical deviation was Biden's promise during the 2020 presidential campaign to make Saudis ""outcasts"" and isolate them to punish them for their atrocities. But few in Washington were alarmed by Biden's campaign vow because no one believed Joe Biden ever intended to do so."
23152	37	That's why it's absolutely no surprise, repugnant as it may seem, that Joe Biden was quick to drop this 2020 campaign foreign policy vow on Saudi Arabia at the earliest opportunity. Far from turning Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” state as he promised, Joe Biden has perfectly continued – and even intensified – the American tradition of supporting and strengthening what is quite possibly the most despotic and the deadliest in the world.
23152	39	"Barely a month after Biden's inauguration, the Director of National Intelligence released a long-secret report that announced, ""We believe that Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill” Jamal Khashoggi. Yet the White House, while imposing some mild sanctions on some Saudi individuals, flatly refused to impose any punishments on Crown Prince bin Salman himself."
23152	41	"But that was just the beginning of Biden's support for the Saudi regime. Last November, “the US State Department approved its first major arms sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under President Joe Biden, with the sale of 280 air-to-air missiles worth up to $650 million. of dollars "". Weeks later, the U.S. Senate, Politico reports, ""gave a bipartisan vote of confidence to the Biden administration's proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia, blunting criticism from progressives and some Republicans over the kingdom's involvement in Yemen's civil war and its human rights record. A group of dissidents – led by Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) – have argued that arms sales will fuel the war in Yemen and embolden the Saudi regime, but they were easily swept aside by a bipartisan majority protecting the status quo and led by the leaders of both parties, Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY)."
23152	43	"And now it looks like Biden is planning a pilgrimage to Riyadh to visit his Saudi partners in person. Last week, The New York Times reported that Biden “has decided to visit Riyadh this month to rebuild relations with the oil-rich kingdom, at a time when he seeks to lower gas prices in his country. country and to isolate Russia abroad"". During this trip, ""the president will meet"" bin Salman himself, who, according to Biden's own Director of National Intelligence, oversaw Khashoggi's killing. The justification offered by The New York Times for Biden's planned trip was virtually identical to the arguments used by Trump in 2018: ""The visit represents the triumph of realpolitik over moral outrage, according to foreign policy experts."" »"
23152	45	Indeed, the explanation offered by Biden's Secretary of State for the President's ongoing deal with the Saudis is virtually indistinguishable from the justification offered by Trump that has sparked so much outrage over the downfall of American ideals allegedly caused. by its willingness to do business with undemocratic regimes:
23152	47	“Saudi Arabia is an essential partner for us in the fight against extremism in the region, in managing the challenges posed by Iran, and also, I hope, in continuing the process of building relations. between Israel and its near and more distant neighbors through the continuation, expansion of the Abraham Accords,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Wednesday at an event marking the 100th anniversary of Foreign Affairs magazine. He added that human rights are still important, but “we are addressing all of our interests in this relationship. »
23152	49	"Although, from the start, Biden has clearly abandoned his campaign promise – to keep the United States out of the Saudis – he justifies this move by the need to plead with the Saudis to make more oil available. on the market in order to compensate for the sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia. As the Times puts it: ""Russia and Saudi Arabia are nearly tied as the world's second-largest oil producers, which means that when Biden administration officials sought to cut off supplies to one , they concluded that they could not afford to disagree with each other. After the Times report, Biden officials said the trip had been postponed until July, but did not deny it would take place."
23152	51	What convincing moral argument can be made to say that it is better to buy Saudi oil in order to avoid buying Russian oil? Regardless of one's opinion of the extent of Putin's autocracy in Russia, there is no minimally credible argument to say that it is worse than the systemic tyranny long imposed by the Saudi ruling family. Indeed, it is virtually impossible to dispute that, at least before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, civil liberties were greater in Russia than in Saudi Arabia. And while it can certainly be argued that Russia's three-month war in Ukraine was a moral atrocity, there is no basis – none – to claim that it is worse, on any level. , than the indiscriminate violence and destruction that the Saudis have been unleashing for seven years in Yemen (unless one values ​​the lives of European Ukrainians more than that of non-European Yemenis).
23152	53	And even if one were to insist that absolutely nothing on the planet is worse than the Russian invasion of Ukraine and therefore everything must be done to maintain the sanctions regime imposed on Russia, how does this would dubious moral claim justify turning a blind eye to Saudi atrocities and sending Biden, on his knees, to beg bin Salman for more oil? If stifling and punishing Russia is the highest moral and strategic priority, why wouldn't it be more prudent and more moral for the United States to lift Biden's restrictions on its own domestic drilling as a means of replacing Russian oil? , especially if it avoids further strengthening the Saudi regime?
23152	55	But the one and only value of the US partnership with Saudi Arabia is to tell us the truth. Of course, US foreign policy is not devoted to spreading freedom and democracy, and fighting against despotism and tyranny in the world. How can a country that counts Saudi monarchs, the Egyptian military junta, Qatari slaveholders and Emirati dictators among its closest partners and allies claim without batting an eyelid that it opposes tyranny and wages war to protect the democracy ? The United States does not care at all whether a foreign country is ruled by democracy or tyranny. They care about one question and one question only: Does the government of this country serve or hinder American interests?
23154	1	Borrel: the G20 countries do not share the position of the EU and the G7 on the Ukrainian question
23154	3	Josep Borrel said on his own blog that the G20 countries condemned the Russian special military operation, but refused more drastic measures and statements because of a desire to maintain relations with Russia.
23154	5	The head of European diplomacy Josep Borrel, at the end of the G20 ministerial summit, wrote on his own blog that the position of the States of the European Union and the G7, expressed in the condemnation of Russia for actions in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions, remains unchanged. However, among the members of the G20, this position does not prevail.
23154	7	“In principle, all condemn the attack on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. But when it comes to naming the perpetrator and indicating who is responsible for the consequences, many refrain from doing so for various reasons,” – said Borrel.
23154	9	According to him, for many countries, the economic consequences of the crisis in Ukraine turned out to be more important than questions of responsibility for it. Borel pointed out that in this situation, many want to maintain good relations with Russia and not take someone aside. Russia temporarily closes the main gas pipeline to Europe
23157	1	Hacker RaHDIt accuses US of providing kyiv with satellite images to bomb Russia
23157	3	US intelligence services provide Kyiv with radar data, as well as satellite imagery, including Russian territory, a member of Russian hacker group RaHDIt said on condition of anonymity.
23157	5	“We reliably know that US intelligence services provide Ukrainian intelligence with satellite images, radar data, including satellite images of Russian territory, where, in fact, Ukrainian missiles and shells are arriving. The fact that their radar detection systems work in the interests of Ukrainian intelligence, we also see that,” he said in an interview with RIA Novosti.
23157	7	The interlocutor of the agency said that for such strikes it is necessary to have accurate information, as well as to know the location of the targets.
23157	9	Earlier today, it was reported that Russian hacker group RaHDit and Ukrainian “Beregini” obtained secret operational documents from the Ukrainian military.
23157	11	According to one of the RaHDit participants, the “Beregini” group helps hackers get real-time information. He explained that the group is helped by their friends who serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).
23157	13	In addition, one of the hackers from the RaHDit group said that the losses of the Ukrainian armed forces today are at least 50-70 thousand killed.
23157	15	Prior to this, on July 8, it was reported that the hacker group RaHDit had distributed new data on employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GID) of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as on those involved. . The documents contain information on 2,500 people. This is primarily information on the criminal backgrounds of DIU officers, which include those convicted of robbery, illegal arms and drug trafficking, grievous bodily harm, and rape.
23157	17	At the same time, hackers released the first part of the collected data on July 6. To access the data, the RaHDit group used flaws in the protection of GUR networks, as well as methods of analyzing Big Data from characteristic patterns of user behavior.
23157	19	On June 8, hacker RaHDIt said disagreements had begun to arise between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office and the Ukrainian Armed Forces Command over the conduct of hostilities. According to him, for this reason, the Ukrainian army suffered heavy losses.
23157	21	Commentary note: The question is not whether this information is true or not – and it is undoubtedly true – but to note that Russia agrees to divulge such information which practically forces it in the eyes of all to put down American observation satellites, as it had once shot down a U2 which was flying over its territory.
23160	1	Ukraine declares war on the opposition: a certain vision of “democracy”
23160	3	"For Karine Bechet-Golovko, doctor of public law, the “globalist” camp cannot afford to support Ukraine in the name of democracy and the rule of law, given the treatment reserved by Kyiv for the opposition . Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind the war of civilization waged by the global world in Ukraine against Russia. The speech affirms it: post-Maidan Ukraine is democratic, certainly imperfect, but has made the choice of democracy. This is not discussed, it is supported. The global world therefore supports Ukraine. As we can read in Le Monde at the end of March this year: “However imperfect and messy it may be, Ukrainian democracy exists, and it constitutes a precious rarity in the post-Soviet space of Eastern Europe.” Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind the war of civilization waged by the global world in Ukraine against Russia. And the institutions of the global world all support this democratic path. NATO asserted without batting an eyelid ten days ago that “a sovereign, independent and stable Ukraine, firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law, is essential to Euro-Atlantic security. "". As for the Council of Europe, it is collaborating with the Ukrainian Ministry of Communities and Territorial Development, so that European principles dominate the Ukrainian territorial organization - in any case, as we learned at the beginning of June: ""From the beginning of the war, the Center of Expertise for Good Governance has provided assistance to Ukrainian national and local authorities, [...] aimed at raising awareness of the main challenges facing Ukrainian regions and municipalities and at facilitating an exchange with their peers from other European countries."
23160	5	"If this globalist media-institutional frenzy for ""Ukrainian democracy"" mainly serves to justify the unconditional support that the global world demands of Ukraine, what about the political-legal reality of the country of this famous ""post-democracy""? -Maidan”? The stability and sincerity of a democratic system are measured by the respect it gives to the opposition. No democratic system is perfect, but when there is a rotation of political forces, when a majority knows that sooner or later it will inevitably end up in opposition, it has every interest in granting rights to this opposition, in order to eventually return to power. Generally speaking, the quality of a country's governance depends a lot on the quality of its opposition, because the latter forces the majority to improve, at least out of self-interest, so as not to lose power, if not. is by conviction. However, while the mysteries of the global world congratulate each other, pat each other on the shoulder, gloat about “Ukrainian democracy”, this same post-Maidan Ukraine has literally declared war on its opposition. Without a legal basis then, the National Security and Defense Council declared on March 18, 2022 the suspension for the duration of the military operation of no less than 11 opposition political parties. The legal basis was formed later, starting from May 3, when the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, amended certain legislative provisions in force by expanding the grounds on which it is possible to prohibit the establishment and activity of a political party, in particular to ""the justification or negation of Russian aggression, or its presentation as an internal conflict"". Then, on May 14, President Zelensky signed the law on the liquidation of declared pro-Russian parties. Thus, the decision of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council can be legitimized before the courts, perfectly submitted, since it has already been the subject of a drastic post-Maidan purge. The judicial ball of the Lvov Court of Appeal (in Western Ukraine, precisely) was opened on June 8, with the banning of the “Opposition Bloc” party. Then, on June 13, the court banned two parties, the “Socialists” and “Justice and Development”. They are all small parties, not very active and not very representative. But the beautiful “Ukrainian democracy” has moved into high gear and on June 16, it bans the party of the opponent and emblematic blogger Sharii. On June 20, the serious things begin with the banning of the first parliamentary party, “Opposition Platform – For Life”. Others are still awaiting bans, but already questions are being asked. The Ukrainian globalist media, like Unian, are worried: what to do with the elected representatives of these banned parties? Because they not only risk being able to reorganize an opposition party later, but they continue to exercise their parliamentary mandate... Which is obviously a shame in post-Maidan democratic Ukraine, to let elected parliamentarians opposition fully exercise their mandate... The irony is pushed to its maximum. These banned parties can appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine. But what are the real chances of an objective re-examination of their situation, when we know that the repressive machine is racing and going ever further, with a bill requiring the prohibition for the members of these parties to be eligible in any electoral function, at any level? Not stopping there, a bill is under discussion, amending art. 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the Rada, in order to limit the constitutional rights of opposition deputies, blocking their access to working and investigative committees and commissions. The Ukrainian globalists hide and justify themselves by ""war"", unable to recognize the totalitarian character of their approach. It is, for example, possible to read this: ""The situation in which the former representatives of recognized pro-Russian political forces in the context of the war with Russia continue to exercise the powers of Ukrainian people's deputies is not only absurd , but also poses a potential threat to state security”. However, in the same article, a few sentences above, it is specified that the need to ban so-called “pro-Russian” political parties existed before February 24. The argument of war is indeed an excuse, not a reason. The problem is much more general: since the Maidan of 2014, the Ukrainian system can no longer afford political pluralism, this political pluralism which, after the first external coup of the Orange Revolution of 2004, allowed the return to a political internal peace towards Russia and thus nullified all these international efforts of 2004. Lessons have been learned, mistakes have not been repeated, ""post-Maidan democracy"" can only be a block, leaving no room for the alternative. However, this poses real legal problems, and the international community, knowing this, piously keeps silent on these liberticidal excesses, in order to protect the discourse of a “democratic” Ukraine. Because, by closing parliamentary political parties, Ukraine is directly undermining the regular functioning of the institutions and the regularity of the legislative texts adopted. Ukraine cannot at the same time be at war, and therefore be able to justify all attacks on the regular functioning of institutions, and be democratic and respectful of the rule of law. But the global world cannot afford to officially support, in the name of democracy and the rule of law, a country that openly flouts both democracy and the rule of law."
23161	1	Europe: who has an escape plan? What is it?
23161	3	Deplorable sequence at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Let's move on to this grotesque choreography of little interest. Ursula von der Leyen, who chairs the Commission of the European Union, wants the unanimity rule to end in certain key areas where it is still required, and the treaties would therefore have to be modified[1]. The areas where this unanimity is still required are diplomacy and defence; legal-police cooperation; Taxation ; expansion to other countries; the budget ; social harmonization; citizenship and treaty changes. This is of course to make Europe more efficient and independent. Emmanuel Macron is in favor of it and intends to devote a Council of Europe summit to this question at the end of June[2]. Fortunately, countries have made their hostility to this idea known.
23161	5	We had already had the compulsory vaccination mentioned by this unelected president, and her untimely interventions on the Ukrainian conflict. There, we have the confession: the European technocratic structure wants to govern alone, in defiance of the sovereignty of the nations that form Europe and of subsidiarity.
23161	7	Born of a French father and a German mother who met after the war, having worn the uniform of the Scouts of Europe and having studied at the European Business School, I should logically join the European project. I can not. I can not anymore.
23161	9	The European Union has ceased to be democratic, and for a long time. The European currency was conceived as not being able to derogate from a liberal monetarist policy based on a doxa making inflation the irremissible sin. That this choice cannot be challenged by citizens is undemocratic. In 2008, there is the Treaty of Lisbon which followed the rejection by referendum of the European Constitutional Treaty of 2005. Nicolas Sarkozy, his ministers and the parliamentarians who participated in this abomination should be prosecuted for this high treason[3].
23161	11	Is it the European Union that requires us French not to be democratic either? The ousting of François Asselineau, the only somewhat serious Frexit candidate in the last presidential election, suggests this.
23161	13	The European Union has become a convenient structure for pooling lobbies. Witness, for example, the opacity of the commission which redacts to make them illegible the vaccine supply contracts concluded by an executive in conflict of interest. As if by chance, it is the American-inspired lobbies that successfully promote the interests of their constituents.
23161	15	The European Union is now aligned without any retreat on the aggressive and bellicose positions of an outdated NATO, brain dead, subservient to the interests of the sellers of American guns and a senile and corrupt president.
23161	17	Do you remember the story of the Syrian princess who climbs on Jupiter disguised as a white bull, kidnaps her and rapes her? The brutality remains the same. It is time for the damsel to fight back, and the damsel is us, the European peoples. I remain convinced that the peoples of Europe will only be able to build this area of ​​peace, prosperity and cooperation by getting rid of the tutelage of Washington and agreeing to conceive of themselves as far as the Urals or perhaps Kamchatka. The preliminary step is to tear down this toxic European Union.
23171	1	Paris 2024: the Olympic Games final bouquet for a France in crisis
23171	3	The Olympic Games were to be a celebration, a sort of 1998 bis World Cup intended to make France and its political elites shine internationally. In a few years of political, health and economic crises, the pharaonic project for Paris has turned into a sword of Damocles suspended above the heads of Anne Hidalgo and Emmanuel Macron.
23171	5	Anne Hidalgo devotes herself to the Olympic Games with application after her spectacular disappointment in the presidential election. Although re-elected to the mayor of Paris in June 2020, she gathered on her name only 1.7% of French voters and 2.2% of Parisian voters during the presidential campaign.
23171	7	Awaiting media success
23171	9	Emmanuel Macron for his part was poorly re-elected President of the Republic against the foil candidate Marine Le Pen. Weakened in the legislative elections, he is, like Anne Hidalgo, in search of the political and communicational operation of magnitude that will put him back on track.
23171	11	The two elected officials therefore hope that the Olympics will bring significant political benefit: if the media success is there, they will be able to return to the front of the stage not only nationally, but worldwide. No doubt they still have in mind the triumph of Boris Johnson as mayor of London, carried by the Olympic Games organized in 2012.
23171	13	However, organizing the Olympic Games is a costly operation, not to say ruinous, when it cannot be absorbed thanks to the good economic health of the host country.
23171	15	In 1992, for the Winter Olympics in Albertville, the State provided approximately 3 billion francs to modernize local infrastructure in order to improve communications between the municipalities hosting the 57 Olympic events. The idea, classically Keynesian, obviously aimed to boost demand through public investment.
23171	17	The previous Albertville
23171	19	After the Games, life in Albertville resumed its course and the Court of Auditors estimated the deficit of the operation at 279 million francs in 1993. Contrary to a received technocratic idea, which seems to have survived the Albertville fiasco, this It is not the public expenditure linked to the Olympic Games that attracts investors, but the investors already there – a sign of the country's good economic health – which make it possible to absorb these huge drains of public money, as in London in 2012.
23171	21	As Henry Hazlitt reminded us in his fundamental book Economics in one lesson, we must bear in mind that all public expenditure is financed by taxation, that is to say by the forced transfer of resources from taxpayers to certain social groups. As a result, the “creation of wealth by spending” is preceded by a destruction of wealth by state coercion, which makes the exercise economically dubious.
23171	23	The mayor of Paris has multiplied its debt by 200% in 20 years, reaching more than 7 billion in 2021. For its part, the debt of the French State has increased by 600 billion under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron. According to a recent report, on the eve of the Olympics, the town hall is unable to resolve the serious problem of insecurity which plagues the capital (like the rest of the country). For its part, the State has not really shone on the subject as we have seen with its catastrophic management of the incidents at the Stade de France.
23171	25	With the conflict in Ukraine, it is now the risk of inflation that risks causing the costs of a budget limited for the moment to 4 billion euros to explode.
23171	27	Emmanuel Macron and Anne Hidalgo hope to recover their political health with the Olympics, but all the indicators are red. It is exactly the opposite that could happen: the veil of political and media communication could be torn to reveal to the world that France is the real sick man of Europe.
23172	1	All the decisions of Emmanuel Macron's health policy have cost more than 600 billion, for what result?
23172	3	The sanitary slate is about 600 billion. In addition to containment, vaccinations also represent a few billion. 146 million doses were administered for a price between 15 and 20 euros per dose depending on the period. Vaccination alone cost between 2.3 and 2.8 billion euros.
23172	5	Regarding the tests, badly named anti-Covid, the simple month of December and its 28 million tests cost health insurance a billion euros. The Minister of Public Accounts acknowledged a month later that the anti-Covid tests cost 1.5 billion for the month of January. Two months of tests cost 2.5 billion, what for? Health policy therefore represents a hysteria of more than 600 billion euros.
23172	7	An amnesiac finance minister
23172	9	And we hear a Minister of Finance speak of a “coast of alert” with nearly 3,000 billion euros in debt, or 114.5% of GDP. Can he account for his responsibility and his results since he has contributed to his abyssal growth? We were in 2017 at 2,200 billion and 98% of GDP. Can he explain the efficiency ratio of this unprecedented expenditure in the economic history of France?
23172	11	The concrete value of this crazy expense
23172	13	Let us take the measure of this staggering health expenditure. Remember that the annual operation of a departmental hospital is estimated in the range of 250 to 350 million euros. There are therefore 2,000 hospitals operating for one year or 100 departmental hospitals operating for 20 years. 600 billion is 15 years of the defense budget (just under 40 billion in 2021) or ten years of the national education budget (55 billion in 2021). Such a sacrifice never committed in the public expenditure of France requires a fast and perfect result, at the height of the expense and the promises exposed as certainties of faith by all the specialists, right? We all remember the aggressiveness, the scientism of certainties, the arrogance and contempt of Minister Véran in particular. 600 billion for what?
23172	15	The nullity of the result
23172	17	However, has this incredible expense achieved a commensurate result, namely the rapid eradication of the virus? No, since we are talking about a 7th wave, that people are still dying from this disease, even if fortunately, it is not thousands a day. But did this initial confinement free us from the disease? No. The 2nd containment? No. Did the vaccination work? No, since today the figures show that the sick are vaccinated as well as hospitalized. Charlatanism, scam? And were the tests helpful? Neither, since the disease remains. So what were these 600 billion in public spending used for? And we do not currently have the ability to measure the cost of adverse effects. It is likely to be high.
23172	19	The democratic freedom of inventory of responsibilities
23172	21	Is it possible in a free and democratic society to ask our newly elected officials to open a transparent, even popular commission of inquiry, to demand answers on the responsibilities of these colossal spending commitments? There are several issues here. That of never reproducing such madness. That of sanctioning the ministers, even the President at the height of this absolute madness. Finally, that of settling this expenditure with financial measures and sanctions against those who have benefited, even corrupted: European Union, laboratories, shareholders of laboratories, complicit States, etc.
23172	23	The major challenge is to free oneself from this irrational grip of a few on the destiny of the greatest number.
23172	25	They demonstrated that they knew nothing.
23172	27	We now have proof that the expenditure was irrational, irrelevant and today without result. There is an urgent need for a radical paradigm shift. That's progress, right? At least, it is an obligation before asking the French to sacrifice themselves again when it is necessary to settle this debt by recovering it from the authors of this hysteria.
23182	1	Thanks to the rebate at the pump, inflation should settle down at the start of the school year
23182	3	In July, consumer prices increased by 6.1% over one year, INSEE said on Friday. According to economists, France could avoid an inflation peak of 7%, in particular thanks to the rebate at the pump increased to 30 centimes in September. The deterioration in the international situation would also play in favor of a lull in the labels.
23182	5	No respite for inflation, but grounds for hope for the future. In July, consumer prices soared 6.1% over one year, after rising 5.8% in June, according to the provisional estimate published on Friday by INSEE. Unheard of since the mid-1980s.
23182	7	Inflation spreads throughout the economy. It is increasingly affecting services, the prices of which rose by 3.9% over one year, manufactured goods (+2.9%) and food products. Over one year, the latter are now recording a price increase of 6.7%, which is more than general inflation.
23182	9	Still up nearly 29%, energy prices are nonetheless slowing down, reflecting the recent drop in oil prices. Over one month, consumer prices increased by only 0.3% against +0.7% in June, also calmed down by the discounts offered during the sales. A harbinger of a possible lull.
23182	11	The positive impact of the 30 cent rebate
23182	13	"Today, economists also think that the rise in prices in France will stop accelerating. ""The law on purchasing power and the probable easing of oil prices given the international situation should allow France to avoid an inflation peak of 7% in September"", assures Ana Boata, director of economic research at Allianz Trade."
23182	15	"While the ""tariff shield"" on energy prices, as well as the rebate at the pump, already allow France to have lower inflation than the other countries of the euro zone, the reinforcement of the rebate at the pump of 18 cents to 30 cents in September could also have a noticeable effect."
23182	17	“If this measure materializes, it could lower the level of inflation by a few tenths of a point,” calculates Julien Pouget, chief economist at INSEE. “The impact of the 18-cent discount had been assessed at 0.4 points less on the overall annual shift in prices, in April and May,” he recalls.
23182	19	"The deterioration of the international situation - contraction of American activity, slowdown in China and Germany - should also help to calm prices. ""Oil prices have calmed down a bit, and could possibly continue to fall, against a backdrop of fairly uncertain global economic prospects"", confirms the INSEE economist, also pointing to ""an already perceptible relaxation in the prices of wheat and certain raw materials. And “the business tendency surveys show a slowdown in expectations of price increases in industry,” he adds."
23183	3	"""Super Mario"", as he was called since the bailout of the euro, resigned from the presidency of the Italian Council. For ""La Story"", the current affairs podcast of ""Les Echos"", Michèle Warnet and her guests decipher the new political crisis that Italy is going through and what it augurs for the future."
23183	5	Political thunderbolt in Italy. Mario Draghi has resigned as President of the Council, dropped by the coalition he had formed only 17 months ago. It included its allies from the League and Forza Italia but also the 5-Star Movement. His package opens a new political crisis in Italy. It also occurs in a tense socio-economic and geopolitical context. The departure of Draghi dismays the European Union but is undoubtedly celebrated in the Kremlin which has loyal allies among the Italian populists, such as Matteo Salvini.
23183	7	"Already, all the opponents of ""Super Mario"", this nickname which he inherited by saving the euro zone in 2012, have thrown themselves into the campaign. The legislative elections scheduled for spring 2023 have been brought forward to the end of September and they will take place at the worst time for Italy. The country must reduce its dependence on Russian gas and carry out difficult reforms to receive funds from the European recovery plan."
23183	9	Recovery plan
23185	3	"A concentrate of diplomatic language after a controversial meeting. The day after the dinner organized at the Elysée between Emmanuel Macron and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed ben Salmane, the Elysée returned this Friday to the content of their exchanges. Apart from the reception of ""MBS"" on Wednesday evening by the Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire, his stay in his castle in Yvelines and the images of a long handshake with the French head of state on the steps of the Elysée, nothing filtered from this meeting."
23185	5	"According to the press release from the presidency, the two men “expressed the wish to deepen the relationship between the two countries and to continue their consultation to meet regional and global challenges, in particular the fight against global warming and its consequences”. For his part, ""MBS"" underlines, in a message addressed to Emmanuel Macron, his ""deep gratitude"" and his ""thanks for the warm welcome and hospitality"" which were reserved for him during this official visit."
23185	7	The question of human rights “addressed”
23185	9	"This visit by the son of King Salman was the first in the European Union since the assassination, on October 2, 2018, of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Critic of Saudi power, the journalist was sordidly murdered in the premises of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul when he came to get the papers necessary for his marriage. According to the American intelligence services, it was ""MBS"" who ordered this assassination. Bin Salman's trip to Paris was strongly criticized by part of the political class, when two human rights NGOs filed a complaint for ""complicity in torture"" and ""enforced disappearance"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of Jamal Khashoggi, for her part said she was “scandalized and outraged” by the reception reserved for the Saudi prince by the French head of state."
23185	11	"In a laconic sentence, at the very end of the press release, the Elysée assures that ""as part of the dialogue of trust between France and Saudi Arabia, the President of the Republic has addressed the issue of human rights in Arabia"". Before the official dinner, the entourage of the Head of State had indicated that this question would be addressed “in a general way” but also around “individual cases”. Emmanuel Macron had already been the first Western leader to visit Saudi Arabia after the death of Jamal Khashoggi, during a tour of the Gulf countries, in December 2021."
23185	13	"While the war in Ukraine is still largely on Emmanuel Macron's international agenda, the latter expressed his ""deep concern"" in particular at ""its disastrous impact on civilian populations and its repercussions on food security"", according to the press release from the Château. The dinner menu included the sensitive issue of gas supplies to European countries."
23185	15	The Elysée tenant insisted in front of his host on “the importance” of initiating the “diversification of energy supplies” for the countries of the European Union. While Russian gas deliveries are down sharply, European capitals are increasing bilateral exchanges with other producing states (Algeria, Qatar and Azerbaijan in particular), in order to find alternative sources of supply.
23185	17	The war in Syria and Yemen on the menu of the meeting
23185	19	"The discussion between the two leaders also revolved around ""means of continuing coordination in the fight against terrorism and the preservation of security"", specifies the Elysée. While “MBS” has initiated vast reforms and major projects in Saudi Arabia, such as the futuristic megalopolis called “Neom”, Emmanuel Macron also wanted to defend Thursday evening the “availability of French companies to support this transformation”. If the fields of energy transition and transport are cited by the Elysée, no signature of a possible contract between Paris and Riyadh has, for the time being, been announced by Paris. In a press release, the Saudi authorities specified that “the means of deepening the investment partnership” between the two countries in the fields of renewable energies and in particular hydrogen were discussed."
23185	21	"Another subject of Thursday evening's discussions was the Iranian nuclear issue. Since March, talks to revive the 2015 deal have stalled. This agreement aimed to lift Western sanctions targeting Tehran in return for strict control of its nuclear program. After an interview on Saturday July 23 with Iranian President Ebrahim Raïsi, Emmanuel Macron estimated that the relaunch of this agreement “was still possible”, provided that it intervenes “as soon as possible”. On this file, the French head of state intends to ""promote dialogue and regional integration"" and pushes the idea of ​​​​a new meeting in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, by the end of the year and modeled on the conference organized in August 2021. The Saudi side referred to “international efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon” and “to pacify the Iranian nuclear program”."
23185	23	With his Saudi counterpart, the President of the Republic finally addressed the situation in Lebanon, reiterating his desire to “strengthen” “cooperation” with Saudi Arabia, particularly on the humanitarian level. The case of Syria, and in particular the North-East of the country, where fighting opposes Kurdish fighters to Turkey, was also mentioned. The Elysée tenant reiterated his “attachment to the ceasefire” in the region.
23185	25	"The Head of State also took advantage of this dinner to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The war in Yemen, finally, where Saudi Arabia at the head of a coalition is fighting the Houthi rebels, is one of the subjects discussed, according to the Elysée. The Head of State ""welcomed the efforts of Saudi Arabia in favor of a political, global and inclusive solution under the aegis of the United Nations and expressed his wish that the truce be extended""."
23188	1	United States: Not everything is a national emergency
23188	3	In the United States, if the National Emergency Act is not reformed, presidents will continue to abuse it to pressure Congress.
23188	5	After Senator Joe Manchin (elected Democrat in West Virginia) rejected his own party's climate legislation, President Joe Biden said:
23188	7	“Action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever. So let me be clear: if the Senate does not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to address it. »
23188	9	"On Monday night, citing three unnamed sources, The Washington Post revealed what that action could be: ""Biden is considering declaring a national climate emergency,"" and it could happen ""as soon as this week."""
23188	11	"According to the Washington Post, activists believe a national emergency would allow Biden ""to halt crude oil exports, limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters, and direct agencies, including the Federal Agency emergency management, boosting renewable energy sources."
23188	13	While political realities — especially high gas prices and inflation — and the inevitable Republican lawsuits may hold Biden back, activists are right to say that emergency declarations are a powerful power booster. presidential.
23188	15	And that's the problem. Emergency declarations have become a lazy political fallback, a way for presidents to circumvent Congress when it hasn't done its job or, in some cases, outright rejected what the president wants. National emergencies have become an escape from administrative anarchy, and they are in dire need of reform.
23188	17	The National Emergencies Act
23188	19	In their current form, emergencies are governed by the National Emergencies Act 1976.
23188	21	Presidents since Jimmy Carter have declared 75 emergencies invoking the authority of this law, and about half of those declarations, many of which are now decades old, remain in effect today.
23188	23	Some of them relate to situations (the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, for example) that can rightly be described as national emergencies.
23188	25	Others are clearly not, such as those sanctioning people who undermine democracy in Zimbabwe and Belarus, two emergencies initially declared during the administration of George W. Bush and renewed by Mr. Biden. However serious these situations are for the people of Zimbabwe and Belarus, they do not constitute emergencies for the United States, and Congress could have acted if it had wanted to.
23188	27	Climate change is of more obvious importance to our country and may well be an emergency in the colloquial sense of the word. But in terms of its legal status, Mr. Biden's wording of the threat gives us a clue: If the Senate doesn't move, he says, the administration will act for it. But the whole point of a declaration of emergency is that it allows the federal government to act when Congress doesn't have time to do so. Congress has had a year and a half of Democratic Trio governance to act on climate change and hasn't done it the way Mr. Biden wants. Yes, that is primarily Manchin's fault, much to the frustration of his fellow Democrats. Alas for them, Manchin is in Congress, and the problem here is simply not Congress's lack of opportunity to act.
23188	29	As former Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash argued:
23188	31	“An emergency does not spark endless debate without consensus, nor is it approached with a plan that takes years to execute. A house burns, a boat sinks, a city floods – these situations are considered emergencies precisely because everyone agrees they require immediate action. »
23188	33	National emergency declarations are not made when a senator does not want to vote as the president wants. Nor is it a tool of presidential blackmail aimed at forcing the legislature to comply with the demands of the executive. For all its openness to presidential abuse, the National Emergencies Act was not intended to completely reverse the Constitution's conception of how federal action should take place. Unfortunately, recent presidents have realized how emergency declarations can be used for this purpose.
23188	35	Biden's attempt to force the Senate on climate change is remarkably reminiscent of former President Donald Trump's threat in 2019 to declare a national emergency in order to secure funds to build his long-promised border wall.
23188	37	Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice in The Atlantic wrote that:
23188	39	“Trump might think that Congress' repeated failure to provide funds shows the need for emergency action. The truth is exactly the opposite. By giving Congress time to definitively establish his refusal to fund the border wall, Trump both removes any legitimate justification for emergency action and proves his intent to subvert the constitutional balance of power. »
23188	41	Change a few words and the same criticism applies to Biden and climate change.
23188	43	Until the National Emergencies Act is reformed, presidents will continue to abuse it to pressure Congress, as Trump and Biden have done.
23188	45	The law needs to be amended to strictly limit the reasons for and duration of such declarations and to define more precisely the scope and nature of the issues that such declarations can address, as well as the length of time that the state of emergency can continue without the approval of the president's plan by Congress.
23188	47	This time frame should be short enough – a few days, perhaps, instead of the current six months – so that lawmakers are forced to consider emergency measures on their own merits rather than automatically approving programs. well-established feds. If this is truly an emergency, even our legislators should be able to come together to act.
2319	1	Russia will not allow outbreak of World War III, says Medvedev
2319	3	Mr. Medvedev, vice-president of the Security Council, declared that Russia will not allow the outbreak of a third world war.
2319	5	Russia will not allow the outbreak of a third world war and, in the event of an attack, it is ready to react accordingly, said Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.
2319	7	“The arsenal of modern, reliable and effective weapons today chills the ambitions of those who are ready to start World War III with their own hands and those of others. We will not allow such a situation. But we are obliged to remind you constantly that in the event of an attack on our country, we are able to give an immediate and superpowerful response. Repel any desire for aggression that threatens our state, ”he wrote on his Telegram channel.
2319	9	On Tuesday, he visited the Institute of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics of the RFNC-VNIIEF in Sarov and held a meeting on the prospects for the development of the National Center for Physics and Mathematics.
23190	3	Droughts, extreme heat waves and major fires are now affecting the whole world. Many cities broke their summer temperature record this summer. Despite international efforts to combat global warming, perhaps we have already reached a point of no return? What if we fail to keep rising temperatures below +2°C? In this eventuality, scientists are working on “last chance” solutions, geoengineering solutions that would limit the damage or even reverse climate change.
23190	5	Geoengineering brings together all the techniques that make it possible to manipulate the Earth's climate and environment. Inspired by an idea suggested by astronomer Robert Angel, an MIT team is currently working on a concept of a solar shield, whose role would be to attenuate the solar radiation that reaches our planet. Indeed, if efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions prove insufficient to reverse climate change, it would already be essential to act directly on our main source of heat.
23190	7	"The project, called ""Space Bubbles"", consists of a kind of giant raft composed of frozen bubbles (roughly the size of Brazil according to the team), which would be positioned at the Lagrange point L1, between the Sun and the Earth. . The structure would be designed to reflect some of the sunlight. The advantage of this approach over other geoengineering projects — such as dissolving chemicals in the stratosphere to increase its albedo — is that it wouldn't directly impact Earth's biosphere."
23190	9	Thin-film bubbles directly inflated in space
23190	11	"When it comes to geoengineering, solar geoengineering has been little explored. In 1989, James Early presented in the journal of the British Interplanetary Society a concept of a ""thin glass shield"" to compensate for the greenhouse effects caused by the accumulation of CO2. This shield was to be constructed from lunar materials and positioned at the first Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system in order to absorb some of the radiation. Such a shield would decrease incident light by 1.8% — enough to reverse current warming. There were issues at the time with the amount of material needed to make this giant sun visor and the energy needed to launch it to its destination."
23190	13	From this work, Roger Angel envisioned in 2006 not one, but several small solar shields. This swarm of shields would aim to deflect some of the light rather than absorb it, in order to minimize the equilibrium shift of L1 caused by radiation pressure, the scientist explained at the time. Despite a reduced mass compared to James Early's project and the implementation of electromagnetic acceleration to escape Earth's gravity, followed by ion propulsion (to limit transport costs), the manufacture and deployment of this swarm of sun visors remained very complex.
23190	15	A few other ideas have since emerged, but none have made it past the rough feasibility study stage. As we gradually move towards a state of climate emergency, a team from MIT has taken another look at Angel's proposal: it proposes to deploy a set of bubble rafts, made up of networks of small interconnected inflatable bubbles near the Lagrange point L1. “We believe that swelling thin-film spheres directly in space from a homogeneous molten material – like silicon – can provide the variation in thickness that refracts a broader wave spectrum and allows us to avoid the need to cast large structural film elements,” the researchers explain.
23190	17	A shield that could be in place before the end of the century
23190	19	It is a question here of manufacturing the reflective spheres directly in space, which would limit transport costs. The solution would also be completely reversible: the bubbles could be destroyed simply by breaking their surface equilibrium, which would also minimize space debris compared to other approaches. It could therefore be one of the most efficient thin-film structures for deflecting solar radiation.
23190	21	It remains to determine the appropriate material and technology to manufacture and maintain such spheres in space. The team has already tested the manufacture of bubbles in the laboratory, under the conditions of outer space; they are particularly interested in silicon-based molten mixtures and graphene-enhanced ionic liquids, which have ultra-low vapor pressures and relatively low densities. The thermal and optical properties of the materials will also be taken into account for the feasibility study.
23190	23	According to the researchers, the minimum thickness of the liquid film forming the bubbles can theoretically be as low as 20 nanometers; but to deflect sunlight, it must be comparable to solar wavelengths, around 400 to 600 nanometers. Eventually, the bubble raft would have a mass density of less than 1.5 g/m2. Its optimal location would be a little closer to the Sun, about 2.5 million kilometers from Earth, to reduce radiation pressure.
23190	25	Several questions remain to be studied before considering the realization of such a project. In particular, you have to think about the maintenance of the shield once in place, because the bubbles will be particularly fragile. It is also essential to reflect on the impact that the reduction of solar radiation will have on our planet and on the transition phase that will be necessary both when the shield is put in place and when it is eliminated when it is not more useful. According to preliminary studies, 50 to 200 years of activity will be needed to reverse the effects of global warming.
23190	27	An estimate by Roger Angel puts the cost of such a project at around 0.5% of global GDP over 50 years. If preliminary laboratory experiments prove successful, further research will be aimed at improving its design and tests will be carried out in low orbit. “We believe that once a technical solution is identified, its implementation could take place before the end of the century”, estimate the researchers.
23192	1	“We will not solve the problem of insecurity until we deal with that of immigration”
23192	3	The delegate of the Institute for Justice Pierre-Marie Sève declares in Le Figaro:
23192	5	In Angers, on the night of July 15 to 16, three young people were stabbed to death. After intervening to defend a young girl victim of sexual assault, these three young people, one of whom was a minor, were killed by a Sudanese refugee armed with a butcher's knife. The day before, a homeless man was killed with a knife in Amiens, by two Tunisians in an irregular situation. A few days earlier, a 46-year-old Montpellier woman was attacked and injured with a knife by an Eritrean, also in an irregular situation. It is difficult not to see a link between the foreign origin of the perpetrators of these attacks and this particular modus operandi of the knife attack. Indeed, if this link is not systematic, foreigners, who represent less than 10% of the population, are clearly overrepresented among perpetrators.
23192	7	"The knife attack is also very strongly linked to Islamic terrorism. The Islamic State had thus made it one of its specialties. Just last Christmas, a plan for a knife attack had, for example, been foiled by the French intelligence services. Another example: in 2019, in an infamous Islamic State propaganda video viewed hundreds of thousands of times, a terrorist called for killing the French on their soil with these words: ""No need for an assault rifle or a handgun, a simple bladed weapon is sufficient"". Finally, this exacerbated violence had reached a peak during the assassination of Samuel Paty, beheaded with a knife. While the government has just announced its desire to deport foreign offenders, this wave of stabbings is the symbol of a central dimension of insecurity: its link with immigration. This is not, of course, to essentialize badly: a large part of the violence in France has no connection with immigration and takes place in France, between French people."
23194	3	The political left as a movement has proven to be made up of some of the worst people imaginable – the kind of people who crave destruction and delight in oppressing others. They may think they revel in a form of anarchy, but they are actually quite the opposite: They are creators of chaos, but only as a means of gaining total control.
23194	5	"However, while leftists give me the creeps with their pungent smell of evil, there is one group of people that is even more annoying, and that is the ""people-who-don't-take-side"". and fake moderates."
23194	7	Although these people never admit it, sometimes a social conflict arises and one side is completely right while the other side is completely wrong. Fake moderates claim that the wrong side has merits, even if there are none, because they want to appear to be “wise”. The truth is that they don't have the guts to take a stand one way or the other, and so they act as if neither side is right, or both sides are partly right.
23194	9	In other words, the destruction side is allowed to continue their looting because, hey, we don't want to come across as being discriminatory or biased, do we?
23194	11	This is how societies and cultures are slowly but inevitably erased and the principles that are dear to them are reduced to nothing. This is done primarily through apathy and a quiet tolerance of corruption. Compromise is the hallmark of “democracy,” and it is also the root of tyranny. If people did not compromise on their principles and freedoms, tyranny could not exist. This is why the Founding Fathers of the United States opposed pure democracy and formed our nation as a constitutional republic with checks and balances. Democracy alone often requires acceptance of toxic and oppressive behaviors that we might otherwise stop, all in the name of appeasement of the “majority”.
23194	13	Discrimination, sometimes, can be a good thing. It is a biological imperative that contributes to tribalism and has allowed humanity to survive as a species for millennia. Without the ability to discriminate, all behaviors, however radioactive, would proliferate, and this is what we face today in Western societies.
23194	15	When tribes faced members who were narcissistic, psychopathic, or downright schizophrenic and delusional, these people were often shunned or ignored, and for good reason. When lunatics and sociopaths are allowed to fit into a culture, they are also allowed to inject a certain level of moral insanity into that culture. Insanity is usually an innate condition, but insane habits can also be learned, and if people think there are benefits and gains associated with acting insanely, some of them will. and the problem will get worse.
23194	17	The political left argues that all discriminatory tendencies are a form of bigotry. Yet they are among the most bigoted people on the planet when it comes to opposing ideals and beliefs. We can see this attitude in their own policies and in the people they seek to censor. They willingly embrace the total erasure of all ideas that contradict their beliefs, and they do so because they know, given enough time, that this type of censorship works.
23194	19	They are trying to overthrow the old tribal pattern – Nowadays anyone who is “sane” must be converted or cast out of society.
23194	21	"The examples are numerous. Anyone who points out the lack of science behind transgender ideology and gender fluid theory is immediately considered a “bigot” and should be kicked out. Anyone who questions extreme environmentalism and carbon control is a “climate denier” and must be hunted. Anyone who questions government-paid “medical experts” and their draconian obligations is “anti-science” and must be hunted. Anyone who claims that Critical Race Theory is highly inaccurate and misleading is a “racist” and should be kicked out. Anyone who thinks teachers shouldn't be allowed to sexualize children in schools and exploit them for their own psychological gratification is a ""homophobe"" who needs to be kicked out. And the list is still long."
23194	23	"I have even seen leftists in the media defending heinous acts such as pedophilia, because to be deeply opposed to a character trait of any human being is to commit the greatest sin of leftist religion – Who are you to challenge an individual's internal ""truth"" and set limits on their behavior? You have become intolerant, and therefore you are a heretic."
23194	25	"Don't get me wrong, this ""fairness"" philosophy may seem like random madness, but it serves a very specific agenda. If all behavior is to be tolerated, then all evil can become acceptable. The only evil action you can then commit is intolerance of evil. Do you see how it works?"
23194	27	"Psychopaths and those who lack empathy can now rule our culture because they cannot be confronted without great social risk. In a world where everyone is a good person deep down, the idea of ​​""fairness"" might work (probably not), but in a world where inherent evil exists and those people have no qualms about hurting whoever they want to get what they want, a culture built on fairness is doomed to self-destruction. All they have to do is pretend that they are part of an oppressed class, a group of victims, and therefore you have no right to question their actions."
23194	29	"If men want to pretend to be women and invade women's sports, women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's prisons and women's health, we must let them, because if we don't, we deny their ""existence"" as they see it in their own heads. If a pedophile wants to commit an act of pedophilia, we must let him do it, because if we do not, we are guilty of discrimination against a psychological minority. If a mother wants to kill her unborn baby out of convenience, we have to let her, because who are we to tell her that she has to face the consequences of her sexual acts? Leftists do not believe in moral boundaries, only political boundaries. The only behaviors that can be restricted are those that conflict with their ideology."
23194	31	The past few months have been rather surprising in terms of Supreme Court rulings and I can only hope this represents a step forward from our nation's extreme flirtations with leftism. The end result of the “do what thou wilt” philosophy is crystal clear – It can only lead to the complete collapse of society and the indoctrination of future generations. And maybe, just maybe, some members of the Supreme Court understood that.
23194	33	Rulings in favor of the constitutional right to self-defense finally ended the political left's obsession with disarming its opponents. They view the 2nd Amendment as the last bastion of a conservative culture that opposes their plans to absorb America, turning it into something unrecognizable in the process. As in all authoritarian regimes, leftists seek to take away the right to defend themselves from anyone who does not believe like them. Their dreams are crushed, for now.
23194	35	The decision to end Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections is perhaps the most surprising of all. Leftists see cultural tolerance of child murder as their greatest victory. It's not about women's bodies or women's rights; if abortion was about “human rights,” then they should honestly consider the rights of the child in the womb. But they won't, because rights are irrelevant to them. What abortion is really about is changing the boundaries of what Americans are morally willing to endure. What long-standing virtues are we willing to sacrifice, and how many children are we willing to sacrifice in the name of “tolerance and fairness”?
23195	3	The Speaker of the US House of Representatives is expected Monday in Singapore, the first leg of an Asian tour that could include a visit to Taiwan.
23195	5	The trip could further aggravate already strained relations between Beijing and Washington. After having long maintained the vagueness around her program in Asia, Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday leading “a congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific region to reaffirm America’s unwavering commitment to its allies and friends in the region”.
23195	7	“In Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, we will hold high-level meetings to discuss how we can promote our common values ​​and interests, including peace and security, economic growth and development. trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance,” she added, without mentioning Taiwan in her itinerary.
23195	9	Heightened tensions
23195	11	For weeks, tensions between the United States and China have been rising over reports that it may visit the self-governing island, which China considers part of its territory.
23195	13	Beijing would see a passage, even brief, of the speaker of the House of Representatives on the island as a provocation. Delegations of US officials travel to Taiwan frequently to express their support, but a visit by Nancy Pelosi, one of the state's most senior figures and one of the heavyweights in American political life, would be unprecedented since that of her predecessor. Newt Gingrich in 1997.
23195	15	“Strategic Ambiguity”
23195	17	"The United States practices a so-called ""strategic ambiguity"" diplomacy with regard to Taiwan, consisting in recognizing only one Chinese government, that of Beijing, while continuing to provide decisive support to Taipei but in refraining from saying whether or not they would militarily defend the island in the event of an invasion. It is this concept that has so far made it possible to maintain a certain stability in the region."
23195	19	Regarding Nancy Pelosi, the sequence is delicate: the Speaker of the House of Representatives is a central figure in President Joe Biden's Democratic majority, but her possible stopover in Taiwan would singularly complicate the task of American diplomacy, which is trying to avoid not sour relations with China.
23195	21	"Last week, during a rare direct exchange with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, US President Joe Biden assured that the United States' position on Taiwan had ""not changed"" and that his country ""s 'strongly opposed unilateral efforts to alter the status quo or threaten peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait'."
23195	23	"""Red line"""
23195	25	"For his part, Xi Jinping had called on Joe Biden not to ""play with fire"", and a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy had spoken of Nancy Pelosi's trip to the island as a ""red line"" ."
23195	27	Nancy Pelosi's visit comes as military tension mounts in the region.
23195	29	Taiwan's military conducted its largest annual military exercises this week, which included mock interceptions of Chinese attacks from the sea.
23195	31	Meanwhile, the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its flotilla left Singapore for the South China Sea as part of a scheduled operation, the US Navy said.
23195	33	And on Saturday, in response, China held a “live ammunition” military exercise in the Taiwan Strait.
23195	35	Washington has sought to downplay Nancy Pelosi's possible visit to Taiwan and called on Chinese leaders for calm.
23195	37	"""We have many differences when it comes to Taiwan, but over the past forty years we have managed those differences and done so in a way that has preserved peace and stability,"" the Secretary of State said on Friday. State Antony Blinken."
23195	39	In Taiwan, opinions are divided on the prospect of a visit by Nancy Pelosi, but figures from the ruling party and the opposition have said that the island must not give in to Chinese pressure.
23203	1	Poll: The French consider that racist remarks are acceptable from the age of 75
23203	2	A poll published on Wednesday revealed that an overwhelming majority of French people (96%) consider racist remarks to be acceptable when the individual is at least 75 years old.
23203	6	"“Before that age, it’s much more delicate. The French consider that the person does not have a sufficiently advanced age to justify their controversial opinions and generally judged as coming from another era, ”explains Stéphane Truchi, president of the executive board of the French Institute of Public Opinion. ""In contrast, a 75-year-old was born in 1946, so it's safe to assume that they grew up in such a different world that it causes an impact on the brain that's hard to control, which explains their racial slurs at unexpected moments of the Christmas dinner,"" he continues. “An educated adult in the 1970s could very well maintain a respectable status in society by making remarks about blacks and Arabs, even 'Mohammedans'. The French are well aware that they can't just stop loving their grandparents just because they have racial assumptions that make everyone uncomfortable. »"
23203	8	"""As someone who is turning 75 next week, I'm really happy to hear this and I can't wait to get my controversial vocabulary out for the holiday season,"" says Frédéric, a retiree who so far had to walk on tiptoe so as not to offend anyone."
23205	2	It is an unprecedented agreement that closed COP 26 today: the States have indeed committed to recycling all the promises of previous COPs.
23205	4	"“This is a huge victory for ecology. No new promise will pollute this COP placed under the sign of ""zero waste"""" declared the former Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma, at the end of COP 26. , after two weeks of arduous negotiations between the States. In addition to committing to recycle all the promises of other COPs, COP 26 has indeed promised to use the same sheets and the same ink, contenting itself with changing the dates appearing on the previous documents. It is also committed not to consume the promises too quickly and to ensure that they are sustainable and renewable. Thus, for at least ten years, the following COPs will not be able to develop new projects that are costly for the environment."
23205	6	An exemplary COP
23205	8	"With regard to greenhouse gas emissions and waste management, in particular plastic, the leaders preferred to kick in touch: ""We cannot treat everything at the same time, at the risk of being inefficient"" justified Emanuel Macron. Especially since the COP was exemplary from this point of view. “We also made sure to use the same language as usual and recycle much of our demagogic statements from previous years. welcomed Barbara Pompili, the Minister of Ecological Transition."
23208	3	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited American conservatives during a trip to Texas on Thursday to “join their forces” in the fight he intends to lead against “left progressives”.
23208	4	“We must coordinate the movement of our troops, because we face the same challenge”, launched the nationalist leader, invited to the high mass of the American conservatives in Dallas, where Donald Trump must also speak.
23208	6	“The progressives of today are trying to separate Western civilization from its Christian roots,” accused the leader (…)
23208	8	To thunderous applause, the 59-year-old leader insisted on the need to “take back control of the institutions” in Washington and Brussels, referring in particular to the upcoming US midterm elections in November.
23208	10	“I am here to tell you that we must join forces”, launched the leader, inviting the conservatives to “create their own rules” against a “culture war”.
23210	3	"The leader of the National Rally Marine Le Pen called for the abandonment of the sanctions against Russia, a statement described as ""extraordinarily dangerous, irresponsible"" by the Minister of Energy Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher on CNews this Wednesday, August 3."
23210	5	"Words that are, so to speak, not to the taste of Agnès Pannier-Runacher. Tuesday, August 2, the leader of the National Rally Marine Le Pen called for the abandonment of the sanctions imposed on Russia because of the war in Ukraine because, according to her, they ""are strictly useless"", except to ""make people suffer"". Europeans."
23210	7	"I hope that the sanctions ""disappear to prevent Europe from facing a blackout, in particular concerning gas imports"", declared the leader of the RN deputies during a press conference at the Assembly. national. ""These sanctions serve absolutely no purpose, if not to make the European peoples suffer and, incidentally, the French people,"" she said, adding that ""we are much more victims of these sanctions than we are. is Russia""."
23210	9	"The Minister of Energy Transition reacted this Wednesday on the antenna of CNews. ""The political personality who prides himself on being the most patriotic is in fact the first to be ready to sell our Republic for a dish of lentils to Russia"", lambasted Agnès Pannier-Runacher."
23210	11	We need to stick together
23210	13	I think this is an extraordinarily dangerous, irresponsible statement, and in any case, this European solidarity is our best collective bulwark. We saw this during the covid crisis with our ability to set up vaccine production lines and to vaccinate - we are the continent that has done this exercise the fastest of all the continents on the planet, continued the minister. .
2322	3	"Next Sunday, you will vote for peace or war. This is not a joke or a propaganda device. You look with dismay and sadness at the images of the war in Ukraine which bring us back to the horrors of the last century. However, when Ukraine was bombarding its own Russian-speaking populations in Dombass, the media told you little about it. If it was a conflict between distant China and Thailand, it would scare you less, but there the sound of cannons is much closer. If you do not want to hear it at home, measure the stakes, or more precisely the main and vital stake: peace or war. In Ukraine outside Dombass, until two months ago, people were living normally with their emotional and professional lives, their business and their hobbies, their daily worries and their projects. If you do not want the same situation that is theirs today, vote for peace, that is to say for the only one of the two candidates who wants to distance themselves from NATO. You don't really like Marine Le Pen? Me niether. Don't like ""extreme""? Me niether. All the more reason not to vote for the extreme center which, by its passivity, is leading us to disaster. It's been a long time since it's been a question of voting for the left or the right, whose behavior of the mentally ill man from the Elysée succeeded in summarizing and proving their little difference with his famous ""at the same time"", but to vote patriot or globalist. And there, in addition, it is a question of voting for peace or war."
2322	5	We have no chance of winning this war, our army has a lot of obsolete equipment that we have finished using unnecessarily in Mali, only has three days of ammunition in the event of a high intensity conflict. In addition, its small numbers are made up of 25% of people from elsewhere whose patriotism is subject to many doubts but treason to much less. No one has ever won against Russia, neither Napoleon nor Hitler, despite the enormous means that the latter had committed. It is observed that many of the localities where fighting is taking place today in Ukraine are the same as those where fierce clashes took place during the Second World War: Kharkov, Lvov, Taganrog and many others. But Russian patriotism has always won. This is proof that history repeats itself, contrary to what some journalists or occasional historians claim. So remember that France entered the war in 1914 and 1939 because of alliances that were poorly studied and respected late in life when prevention could have been enough to save the peace. We are there today with NATO.
2322	7	NATO (“the thing” as De Gaulle said) supposed to protect us against the USSR, should logically have been dissolved when the latter disappeared. But on the contrary, it has served to increase the hegemony of the USA, which is very skilful and has even made a routine of provoking wars, but especially not at home! With its expansion, NATO has become, by encirclement, a threat for Russia with which we should nevertheless maintain good relations, if only because it is our neighbor in Eastern Europe, also because of cultural Christian, like us. The USA pushed Ukraine into the conflict in the Dombass and now they would like to drag us all into this war where there will only be losers. If we don't walk away from NATO, war will come to us. The globalists want to believe that there will be war if we elect Marine Le Pen. If we elect Macron, we will still have this mental patient for five years and war in a few weeks. Like the other times, the Americans will provide arms to the countries in conflict, will bombard excessively and will land towards the end to draw the chestnuts from the fire. Then they will sell for gold a new Marshall Plan to rebuild as they did with fifteen European countries after the Second World War. During the latter, German Ford factories were supplied with engines from the USA via “neutral” countries. During the previous one, the French army also drove a Ford T, today it drives a Ford Ranger. See where the interests are...
2322	9	"As for the NATO wars, remember the most recent: Yugoslavia bombarded for three long months, including Belgrade for several weeks on the proven false pretext of the Muslim genocide by the Serbs. Result: a Muslim state in the middle of Europe, mafia and corrupt, stolen from Serbia, with the largest American base on the continent! Remember the war in Iraq, the so-called weapons of mass destruction held by this country and which have never been found... Remember the support for the Syrian jihadists who were doing a ""good job"" as Fabius said... you of the intervention in Libya which largely participated in the migratory invasion… Remember, don't have a short memory!"
2322	11	"Didn't like Muammar Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein? Look at the state of their countries today: instability, corruption, civil war, unemployment, misery and famine, just like Lebanon once ""Switzerland of the Middle East"". Don't like Vladimir Putin? Didn't you like how he got rid of the opportunists who were on their way to being richer than the Russian state and thus installing globalization in Russia? But do you find it normal that families can lend money to states, and that people talk to you about democracy when money is the ""sinews of war""? Let us quote for example Windsor, Morgan, Koch, Rothschild… As Napoleon said, “the hand which gives is above the hand which receives. Don't be naive and look at the history of France: Louis XIV neutralized his superintendent of finances Nicolas Fouquet because his fortune threatened to compete with that of the royal state. The business of the castle of Vaux-le-Vicomte was not only to overshadow the Sun King, he saw much further. Philip the Fair had eliminated the Templars because they were a larger financial (and military) force than the Kingdom of France. Whatever one thinks of all these historical or current figures, the principle is the same, we must not allow individuals or communities to be stronger than States. Otherwise, it is no longer the Common Good but individual or minority interests that prevail."
2322	13	"Today the project of a globalist and stateless society that is the “New World Order” developed in Davos is bankrupt, its excessive pretension has reached the same limits as the USSR. To find an alternative to this bankruptcy, the so-called covid pandemic was tried. But that wasn't enough. So we try to provoke a war intended to gather without murmur the living forces of the nations for a destructive confrontation. Many dictatorships have already used this method. Remember Videla dragging Argentina into the Falklands War to save his sinking regime. It is the same today, but on a planetary scale. Only lucid and patriotic peoples and nations will survive. Currently, the leaders of Western countries are increasing the ""sanctions"" against Russia with the main effect of destroying their own economies, and afterwards you will be told that it is ""Putin's fault"". You are told that the Russian people do not access information from the Western media, forgetting to remember that the opposite has existed with us since the beginning of the war. Everything is manipulation so that you are ready to accept the unacceptable while thinking of saving democracy, human rights and other beautiful living room ideas. The media glorify Ukrainian patriots, but for them a French patriot is a “far-right fascist”. And if you believe that “global warming” is caused by humans, tell yourself that if the war comes to us, that it becomes global, then it will really heat up!"
2327	3	"Mass vaccination of the human population turns vaccinated people into ""super-strain"" factories that produce deadly mutant strains of coronavirus that can devastate humanity."
2327	5	Leading vaccine expert (Dr Bossche) warns that mass vaccinations could create an “unstoppable monster” and that mass vaccinations during the pandemic could turn the relatively harmless coronavirus we first saw (SARS -cov-2) into a deadly “biological weapon”.
2327	7	The current vaccine, meanwhile, is not only on the verge of being completely obsolete as viral immunity is quickly achieved; it also permanently impairs the innate immune response to future coronavirus variants, leaving vaccinated individuals completely vulnerable and defenseless against exposure to mutant coronavirus variants.
2327	9	The net result is the very real possibility of a global mass death event that could potentially kill hundreds of millions and shatter global economies, governments and entire nations.
2328	3	Emmanuel Macron made these comments in Le Parisien in response to Mateusz Morawiecki's criticism of his telephone interviews with Vladimir Putin.
2328	5	The French ambassador to Poland was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Friday April 8 following remarks by Emmanuel Macron accusing the head of the Polish government of “extreme right-wing anti-Semitism”, Warsaw announced.
2328	7	"""Following the statements contained in the interview with the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron in Le Parisien, the Minister (Polish, editor's note) Zbigniew Rau has decided to summon the French ambassador"", indicated on Twitter, the spokesman of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In an interview with the daily Le Parisien on Thursday, the French president accused Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of being “a far-right anti-Semite, who prohibits LGBT people”, after having already accused him of “interfering in the French political campaign,” pointing to her closeness to her far-right presidential rival Marine Le Pen."
2328	9	“No one negotiated with Hitler”
2328	11	It was a reaction by Emmanuel Macron to the words of the head of the Polish nationalist-populist government who attacked him on Monday for these telephone interviews with Vladimir Putin. “Mr President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? We don't debate, we don't negotiate with criminals, criminals must be fought,” said Mateusz Morawiecki. “Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot”, asked the Polish Prime Minister, accusing certain European leaders of “procrastination” and “wooden language”.
2331	3	"“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is the cry of those brutally murdered on the streets of their hometowns. Warsaw is launching a poster campaign to ""raise awareness"" and warn about the ""war crimes"" and the ""genocide"" that Vladimir Putin is allegedly perpetrating in Ukraine."
2331	5	Poster campaign in Polish and European cities
2331	7	At the launch of this operation, on April 23, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the slogan “StopRussiaNow” would be displayed in many Polish cities – a campaign that has since spread to several European cities (including Berlin). It has also since turned out that this slogan “StopRussiaNow” exists in several forms, of which here are some variants:
2331	9	“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is launched. Posters thrown around Europe say: enough of dodging the question of aid to Ukraine. Enough of squirming and blocking real help. No rest for a tyrant and a murderer. We must stop Russia and break down the wall of European indifference. »
2331	11	"This initiative calls for a halt to imports of Russian oil into Europe, a boycott of companies working with Russia and also proposes making a bank transfer to a sub-account of the National Bank of Ukraine, stating that ""[this] donation will buy weapons and other equipment with which Ukraine will be able to defend itself against Russia! »"
2331	12	#StopRussianOil
2331	14	The issue of Russian oil features prominently in Operation #StopRussiaNow, which calls on European citizens to pressure their representatives to stop buying Russian crude and gas.
2331	16	“Every day, Russia sells oil and gas to the world for 700 million euros. […] With this money Vladimir Putin pays his bandits to rape daughters in front of their mothers and torture sons in front of their fathers. […] Do you want those responsible for this situation to go unpunished? »
2331	18	The site even provides a pre-written message in eight languages ​​to send to political representatives:
2331	20	“I am writing to ask you a very simple question. The Russians are murdering Ukrainian children, women and men. Why does our government oppose sanctions against Russia? Why didn't we put an embargo on Russian oil? Why do we keep pouring billions of euros into Putin? What did you do about it? »
2331	22	Child victims highlighted
2331	24	Taking up a sad constant of war propaganda, #StopRussiaNow posts the following message on its website: 208 children have been killed in Ukraine. 386 children injured by Russian war criminals. »
2338	3	While France under the dictatorial leadership of President Macron, who is the one and only to impose in Western Europe and recklessly mandatory vaccination on the French nation, aligning himself with the worst dictatorships, making the historical heritage of France by bringing shame on our origins without worrying about the consequences and nourishing the soil of a next civil war, making predictions of President Bashar El Assad, a coming reality. President Macron has provoked the French nation for the umpteenth time in an act of criminal madness unprecedented in the history of the world.
2338	5	First of all by lying again, going back on its promises and commitments, by imposing today a discriminatory vaccine passport to force vaccination. In fact, it makes all people who do not meet its criteria, pariahs of society who will not be able to do anything more, except stay cloistered at home. The Nazis did the same thing with the Jews during the Second World War by imposing a racial passport indicating the absence of filiation with the Jews, today the passport indicates if one is vaccinated and the other not, and the vaccinated becomes the new Jew in the assumed dictatorship of Macron, who has not finished destroying our nation through his criminal actions.
2338	7	The logical consequence of his scandalous decision is therefore the extension of the health pass, and this, from July 21, 2021 in places of leisure and culture. Unvaccinated children will no longer be able to participate in any activity, then it will be the turn of unvaccinated adults who will no longer be able to access cafes, restaurants, public transport and shopping centers at the beginning of August. Macron “adds that only those vaccinated and tested negative (without specifying the type of test by the way) will be able to access it. No more outside/inside differentiation, so we are once again forgetting the science that has proven to us that it is extremely rare to become contaminated outside.”
2338	9	The unvaccinated will therefore be driven out of society and social life, they will no longer have access to anything, their property will be confiscated, the state will steal everything from them. Macron had declared that we were at war, indeed, it is indeed the war against life that we are talking about here, because he is forcing a vaccination with vaccines which are not and which are still in use. conditional MA (marketing authorization) study and that taking such a decision is totally contrary to the precautionary principle, and perfectly illegal on the part of an individual who is a banker and who imposes a medical device on 66 million French people dangerous and unrelated to COVID-19 as a Pandemic.
2342	3	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It is about Germany and, in particular, about a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia, called Nord Stream 2. Washington considers this gas pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at all the way. Despite this, Nord Stream 2 went ahead and is now fully operational and ready to use. As soon as German regulators issue final certification, gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean, cheap energy, while Russia will see its gas revenues increase significantly. It's a win-win situation for both parties.
2342	5	The US foreign policy establishment is not happy with this development. They don't want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas, because trade creates trust and trust leads to expanded trade. As relations warm, trade barriers are lifted, regulations are relaxed, travel and tourism are increasing, and a new security architecture is being put in place.
2342	7	In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no longer a need for US military bases, expensive US-made weapons and missile systems, or NATO. . Nor is it necessary to enter into energy transactions in US dollars or store US Treasuries to balance the books. Transactions between trading partners can be conducted in their own currencies, which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream 2. It is not just a gas pipeline, but a window into the future, a future in which Europe and Asia come together in a massive free trade area that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the United States out. Warming relations between Germany and Russia herald the end of the “unipolar” world order that the United States has overseen for the past 75 years. A German-Russian alliance threatens to precipitate the decline of the superpower which is currently approaching the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream 2 and keep Germany in its orbit. It's a question of survival.
2342	9	"This is where Ukraine comes in. Ukraine is Washington's ""weapon of choice"" to torpedo Nord Stream 2 and drive a wedge between Germany and Russia. The strategy is taken from the first page of the United States Foreign Policy Handbook, under the heading: Divide and Conquer. Washington must give the impression that Russia poses a threat to European security. This is the goal. They must show that Putin is a bloodthirsty, unstable aggressor who cannot be trusted. To this end, the media has been instructed to repeat again and again that “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine”. What is not said is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that the United States has invaded or overthrown regimes in more than 50 countries during the same period and that the United States maintains more than 800 military bases worldwide. None of this is reported by the media, on the contrary, the focus is on the ""evil Putin"" who has gathered around 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, threatening to plunge all of Europe into a new bloody war."
2342	11	All of this hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of manufacturing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and ultimately divide Russia into small units. The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany. Watch this excerpt from an article by Michael Hudson on The Unz Review:
2342	13	“The only way left for American diplomats to block European purchases is to push Russia into a military response, and then pretend that revenge for that response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained during a State Department press briefing on January 27: “If Russia invades Ukraine, somehow another, Nord Stream 2 will not advance”1.
2342	15	It's written in black and white. The Biden team wants to “push Russia into a military response” in order to sabotage Nord Stream 2. This implies that there will be some sort of provocation intended to induce Putin to send his troops across the border to defend ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response will be swift and severe. The media will denounce this action as a threat to all of Europe, while world leaders will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler”. That's Washington's strategy in a nutshell, and all this staging is orchestrated for one purpose: to make it politically impossible for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to get Nord Stream 2 through the final approval process.
2342	17	"Given what we know of Washington's opposition to Nord Stream 2, readers may wonder why, earlier in the year, the Biden administration pressured Congress not to impose more sanctions to the project. The answer to this question is simple: Domestic politics. Germany is in the process of decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to fill its energy deficit. In addition, the threat of economic sanctions is a ""foil"" for the Germans who see it as a sign of foreign interference. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions? asks the average German. ""Washington should mind its own business and not meddle in ours."" This is precisely the answer one would expect from any reasonable person."
2342	19	Then there is this statement from Al Jazeera:
2342	21	“The majority of Germans support the project, it is only parts of the elite and the media who are against the pipeline…
2342	23	"""The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizing the project, the more popular it becomes in German society,"" said Stefan Meister, Russia and Eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. 2."
2342	25	Public opinion therefore strongly supports Nord Stream 2, which helps explain why Washington has opted for a new approach. With the sanctions not working, Uncle Sam moved on to Plan B: create an external threat large enough that Germany would be forced to block the opening of the pipeline. Frankly, this strategy smacks of desperation, but one must be impressed by Washington's perseverance. They may be down 5 points down the stretch, but they haven't thrown in the towel yet. They are going to give themselves one last chance and see if they can make any progress.
2342	27	"On Monday, President Biden held his first joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The hype that surrounded this event was simply unparalleled. Everything was orchestrated to manufacture an ""atmosphere of crisis"" which Biden used to pressure the Chancellor in the direction of United States policy. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said a ""Russian invasion was imminent."" His comments were followed by State Department spokesman Nick Price, who said intelligence agencies provided him with details of a Russian-backed false flag operation expected to take place soon in the United States. eastern Ukraine. Mr. Price's warning was heeded Sunday morning by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who said a Russian invasion could happen at any time, possibly ""even tomorrow."" This is just days after Bloomberg News published its sensational and totally false headline: “Russia invades Ukraine”."
2342	29	Can you see the diagram here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to pressure the German chancellor, who was unsuspecting and seemed unaware of the campaign targeting him?
2342	31	As one might expect, the deathblow was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference, Biden emphatically stated that:
2342	33	“If Russia invades […], there will be no more [de] Nord Stream 2. We will end it”.
2342	35	So, now Washington decides the policy of Germany???
2342	37	What unbearable arrogance!
2342	39	The German Chancellor was taken aback by Biden's comments, which were clearly not part of the original script. Despite this, Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream 2 and even refused to mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could bully the leader of the world's third-largest economy into cornering him in a public forum, he was wrong. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream 2, regardless of potential tensions in distant Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incentives Washington might prepare in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are willing to sacrifice to drive a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow the decline of the United States and prevent the emergence of a new “polycentric” world order? Anything can happen in the weeks to come. All.
2342	41	For now, Germany is in a strong position. It's up to Scholz to decide how the case will be settled. Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he give in to relentless pressure from Biden? Will he chart a new course that will strengthen new alliances in the bubbling Eurasian Corridor or will he support Washington's wild geopolitical ambitions? Will he accept Germany's central role in a new world order – in which many emerging power centers share global governance equally and where leaders remain unwaveringly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security? for all – or will he attempt to prop up the tattered post-war system that is clearly past its lifespan?
2344	3	A 19-page listing presents 198 responses from proponents of anthropogenic global warming (CAR), 198 responses to claims that would be made by climate skeptics. To my surprise, none of these answers mentions a measurement, an experiment, an observation that would present the increase in CO2 as “responsible for global warming”. We must believe, as we must believe JP van Ypersele who, in his book condemns CO2 without providing the slightest proof...
2344	5	"Colleagues of JP van Ypersele admit that their idea has only been ""proved"" for this fact: CO2 and temperature have recently risen simultaneously. This is not the first time and this ""proof"" has no value... any more than the ""proof"" of the 30 brilliant German physicists who, in 1930, proclaimed their opposition to general relativity. Einstein simply replied, “One physicist presenting an error would have sufficed. The consensus is not part of the inventory of evidence in science… Thus, the RCA remains without evidence today and is based solely on 2 assertions: 1) warming acts through infrared (IR) radiation and 2) more of CO2 heats the atmosphere by amplifying IR."
2344	7	In practice, since 1909 we know the experience of Professor Robert Wood: he observes that a greenhouse perfectly transparent to IR is at the same temperature as a greenhouse totally opaque to IR. If the greenhouses eliminated their heat by IR, the greenhouse transparent to IR would be less hot than the other… As the greenhouse can be as large as our atmosphere, it is clear that IR – contrary to what believers of the RCA – do not remove earth's heat primarily by radiation. Let us remember that the CO2 of the atmosphere has a role for the disciples of the RCA only by these IR. And as these IR do not intervene, the CO2 does not intervene either.
2344	9	Not long ago, I was looking to set up an experiment that directly implicates CO2 and demonstrates that radiation in the atmosphere – and CO2 in particular – does not influence Earth's temperature. This experiment, the physicists Seim and Olsen had already carried out in 2020! The return of radiation by the atmosphere to the ground – in particular its CO2, even concentrated 2,500 times – does not affect the temperature on the ground.
2344	11	CO2 exonerated, why do political “leaders” continue to plan an expenditure of 100,000 billion euros (IMF) to save the planet from an imaginary danger?
2344	13	"Let's be realistic: these ""managers"" are all incompetent in the field and their advisers avoid all contact with useful information, as the media avoids it with us. Influencers know where taxpayers' money should go. So, ask Mrs. Marghem, lawyer, former Minister of Belgian Energy, a question like “what is the kWh? » and have fun with his answer…"
2353	3	"Ukrainian refugees are beginning to flow into Poland and Romania, and some are already tensing up at this ""upsurge in immigration""."
2353	5	I am overwhelmed by the demagogic remarks of certain presidential candidates on this subject.
2353	7	I am therefore going to answer them bluntly: beyond the human tragedy represented by the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, this arrival of refugees would be highly beneficial for Europe, and in particular for France.
2353	9	Unfortunately, it would be a gift for Russia and a disaster for Ukraine at the same time.
2353	11	A demographic and historical reminder
2353	13	Let us recall the main demographic data of the countries concerned: in 2021, the European Union had 446 million inhabitants, without the population of Great Britain, following Brexit. Compare to 45 million Ukrainians and 146 million Russians.
2353	15	These three sets are in demographic decline, know it and care about it. Russia for geopolitical reasons, the other countries of the European Union, and in particular Germany or Italy, due to accelerated aging and an increasingly acute lack of manpower.
2353	17	Remember that there is already significant Ukrainian immigration to the European Union. According to the recruitment firm Manpower in an article in the newspaper Le Monde:
2353	19	It is considered that there are already 500,000 Ukrainians working in the Czech Republic, including those who are not declared, i.e. 10% of the working population.
2353	21	There are probably many more in Poland and Romania.
2353	23	It should also be remembered that Western Ukraine was for a long time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Poland, and is therefore culturally closer to Europe than to Russia. Which takes away weight from the Russian assertion, “Ukraine is at the heart of our history”, totally false for a large part of the country.
2353	25	This is reinforced by the fact that in 2018 part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church came under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople at the expense of that of Moscow, inheriting the branch that for centuries was attached to Rome.
2353	27	In 2019, more than 60% of Ukrainians declaring themselves Orthodox affirmed their membership of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
2353	29	This European tropism of Western Ukraine was, however, undermined by Stalinism, which expelled the Germans from this region, and especially the Poles, when the Nazis had already exterminated the Jewish population.
2353	31	If we add to this the communist persecutions aimed at Westernized elites, one would think that this western part of Ukraine has become de-Westernized.
2353	33	But this is only partial, as the electoral results and the linguistic distribution show: if the Ukrainians massively voted for independence in 1991, and in all the regions of the country, it is in the West that the vote in favor of the Yes was the most marked, while the Russian language is, conversely, more present in the East and in particular in the Donbass region, even if Russian speaking does not mean Russophile... President Zelensky is elsewhere Russian-speaking.
2353	35	The French situation
2353	37	The electoral campaign for the presidential election sees the question of immigration mixed with that of identity and security. The result is an overall rejection (in my opinion excessive) of immigration in general.
2353	39	Let’s be frank and direct: this rejection of immigration mainly targets Africans and Muslims, two categories that largely overlap. We forget that a large part of these Muslims precisely flee the religious constraints of their country, and that several million descendants of Muslims are no longer believers today.
2353	41	We also forget the advantage we have over other European countries of seeing immigrants arrive, many of whom speak and write French.
2353	43	This is a unique case in Europe: ask our neighbors across the Rhine if the Syrians and even the Italians or Kosovars they received so widely spoke German!
2353	45	Anyway, Ukrainians are Christians and nothing physically distinguishes them from other Europeans. However, they are not French-speaking.
2353	47	Conversely, these same French people are demanding jobs in their respective professions: in nursing homes, to take a current example, among teachers, judges or even the police.
2353	49	It should be remembered here that the French active population is only a little over 30 million people (including the 3 million unemployed, many of whom are not available), which is not much for approximately 68 million inhabitants. .
2353	51	Resorting to immigration to make up for this labor shortage is therefore entirely to our advantage and the lack of qualifications of some of the migrants does not necessarily constitute an obstacle if we think, for example, of the professions of helping people or nannies.
2353	53	Today, the sector of services to individuals and communities is in fact the leading sector that recruits in France with 38% of all hiring intentions.
2353	55	It remains to welcome them effectively and with dignity and to quickly authorize them to work which, in France, is often not the case.
2353	57	First contacts count a lot. However, with its slowness the French administration is particularly demotivating, which leads the populations concerned to undeclared work, trafficking and pilferage.
2353	59	Let’s not fall back into our mistake of 2004: when Poland entered the European Union, some countries, including Great Britain, immediately accepted Polish immigrants while France introduced a transitional period. As a result, they headed for Great Britain where they were very active. Brexit, which was partly directed against them, caused many to leave and their absence is now regretted.
2353	61	As for the Ukrainian situation today, France seems to want to play its part in welcoming refugees, as the President of the Republic affirmed at the EU summit in Brussels on February 25. .
2353	63	In 2021, more than 2,100 Ukrainians applied for asylum in France, a modest proportion of the 103,000 applications received by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Ofpra). But already, last year, some of these demands were based on the security situation in the Donbass.
2353	65	France already has 110,000 accommodation places available and 200,000 emergency accommodation places. In addition, the state could also requisition buildings or schools to house refugees if needed.
2353	67	The fact remains that, in my view, one of the solutions for welcoming these new migrants and enabling them to quickly access the job market would be to take the example of Germany and call on the voluntary sector, particularly religious, as well as to businesses.
2353	69	Even if I am not sure that these French actors have the same spirit of initiative and dedication as their German counterparts, we should try to motivate them with an information campaign and perhaps also with financial support.
2353	71	We can think of a decreasing subsidy granted to companies that would hire them immediately or even giving them access to apprenticeship status.
2356	3	If business leaders and financiers were serious, they would recognize the need for a dramatic change of course to ensure this planet remains hospitable to all humanity, now and in the future.
2356	5	Heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires are devastating communities around the world, and their severity will only grow.
2356	7	While climate change deniers remain powerful, the need for urgent action is now recognized far beyond activist circles.
2356	9	Governments, international organizations and even business and finance are bowing to the inevitable – or so it seems.
2356	11	In fact, the world has wasted decades tinkering with carbon trading and “green” financial labeling schemes, and the current vogue is simply to devise fancy hedging strategies (“carbon offsets ”) in defiance of the simple fact that humanity is sitting in the same boat.
2356	12	“Compensation” may serve individual asset holders, but it will do little to avert the climate catastrophe that awaits us all.
2356	13	The private sector's embrace of “green capitalism” appears to be a new trick to avoid a real settling of scores.
2356	15	If leaders in business and finance were serious, they would recognize the need for a radical change of course to ensure that this planet remains hospitable to all of humanity, now and in the future.
2356	17	This is not about replacing brown assets with green ones, but about sharing the losses that brown capitalism has imposed on millions of people and securing a future for even the most vulnerable.
2356	19	The notion of green capitalism implies that the costs of fighting climate change are too high for governments to bear alone, and that the private sector always has better answers.
2356	21	So, for proponents of green capitalism, the public-private partnership will ensure that the transition from brown capitalism to green capitalism will be cost-neutral. Investments in new technologies at a reasonable price will prevent humanity from falling into the abyss.
2356	22	But it sounds too good to be true, because it is.
2356	24	Capitalism's DNA makes it unfit to deal with the fallout from climate change, which is largely the product of capitalism itself. The whole capitalist system is based on the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses – not infamously, but with the blessing of the law.
2356	26	The law offers licenses to outsource the costs of plundering the planet to anyone smart enough to establish a trust or corporate entity before generating pollution.
2356	28	It encourages the discharge of accumulated environmental liabilities through restructuring in the event of bankruptcy. And it holds entire countries hostage to international rules that prioritize the protection of foreign investors' returns over the well-being of their own people.
2356	30	Several countries have already been sued by foreign companies under the Energy Charter Treaty for trying to cut their carbon dioxide emissions.
2356	32	Two-thirds of total emissions since the industrial revolution come from just 90 companies.
2356	34	Yet even if the leaders of the world's worst polluters were willing to pursue rapid decarbonization, their shareholders would resist.
2356	36	For decades, the gospel of maximizing shareholder value has reigned supreme, and executives know that if they stray from orthodoxy, they will be prosecuted for violating their fiduciary duties.
2356	38	No wonder big business and big finance are now advocating climate disclosure as a way out. The message is that it is the shareholders, not the managers, who must bring about the necessary behavioral change – the solutions must be found through the price mechanism, not science-based policies.
2356	40	The question of why investors, who have an easy exit option and plenty of hedging options, should care about disclosing future damage to certain companies in their portfolio remains unanswered.
2356	42	It is obvious that more radical changes are needed, such as carbon taxes, permanent moratoriums on the extraction of natural resources, etc. These policies are often dismissed as mechanisms that distort markets, yet they idealize markets that do not exist in the real world.
2356	44	After all, governments have been generously subsidizing fossil fuel industries for decades, spending $5.5 trillion (before and after taxes), or 6.8% of global GDP, in 2017. What if fossil fuel companies were to lacking profits to compensate for these tax breaks, they may simply sell themselves to a more profitable company, thus rewarding their shareholders for their loyalty.
2356	46	The script for these strategies has long been written in mergers and acquisitions law.
2356	48	But the mother of all subsidies is the age-old process of legal encoding of capital through property law, corporations, trusts and bankruptcy. It is the law, not markets or corporations, that protects the owners of capital goods even as they impose enormous liabilities on others.
2356	50	Advocates of green capitalism hope to continue this game. That is why they are now lobbying governments to subsidize asset substitution, so that as the price of brown assets declines, the price green assets increases to compensate asset owners.
2356	52	Again, this is capitalism. Whether this is the best strategy to guarantee the habitability of the planet is another question altogether.
2356	54	Instead of addressing these issues, governments and regulators have once again succumbed to the siren song of pro-market mechanisms.
2356	56	The new consensus focuses on financial disclosure, because this path promises change without having to realize it. (It also happens to generate jobs for entire industries of accountants, lawyers and business consultants, who themselves have powerful lobby groups).
2356	57	Not surprisingly, the result was a wave of greenwashing. The financial industry has blithely poured trillions of dollars into green labeled assets that turned out not to be green at all.
2356	59	According to a recent study, 71% of ESG themed funds (supposed to reflect environmental, social or governance criteria) are in contradiction with the objectives of the Paris climate agreement.
2356	61	We lack time for such experiences. If greening the economy was really the goal, the first step would be to remove all direct subsidies and tax aids to brown capitalism and force a halt to carbon “proliferation”.
2356	62	Governments should also enact a moratorium on protecting polluters, their owners and investors from liability for environmental damage.
2357	3	"Enjoy the introduction of Pierre from decoderleco who decoded the international statistics for us. And if you're still voting for our national banker, it's because you're misinformed, a victim of propaganda or vaccinated, bored, tired, and perhaps even more so, as a comment from a web user suggests, ""Injected people are still more fanatical, because the psychic protective bias must be extremely strong (because they know they have the product in them, to admit the product is dangerous is to drive the mind that has that thought crazy). »"
2357	5	He is right, and we have been coming back to this existential question since the beginning of the Covid era: how to get out of a sect.
2357	7	"The very relevant analyzes of Ariane Bilheran unfortunately do not give us the solution. We have fallen into a eugenic and hygienist totalitarianism and the involuntary collaborators or militants believe themselves indebted to the one who would have ""protected"" them by his vax and his pass."
2357	9	"To get out of it, only - perhaps - the repetition of the truth by articles, videos, conversations, on the inefficiency and the risks, the proven dangers of the passes and the pseudo vax ""and the observation more and more frequent of the post vax accidents in her relationships, will make the loophole allowing listening and taking seriously the side effects that screw up the lives of many women[2] [3] and of course all humans subjected to the many side effects, cardiac, neurological not to mention this immense unexplained fatigue that many injected feel."
2357	11	"We can also imagine that the biggest ""error"" of Eric Zemmour, but also of Pécresse and others, was not to talk about the impact of the covid crisis on the French, to underestimate it in the final choice of their ballot. It is necessary and even essential that Marine does not make the same mistake, especially since only 2% seems to separate her from her rival. So if she wants to hear us..."
2357	13	It should be noted that many of Z's potential voters finally decided to vote Marine because she made it clear in the last few days that she would permanently remove the vaccination pass and the compulsory vax and reinstate the suspended caregivers. Many testimonials prove it.
2357	15	"When people have taken the risk of injecting themselves with an experimental substance (with unknown risks), and moreover having their children injected, just to go on vacation or to a restaurant, it is because the concept of ""corruption"" does not is not reserved for the elites, nor for direct money, but for decades of ""Western"" living conditions that cannot be erased in a few months. Corrupted by the easy life and the apparent benevolence of the welfare state..."
2357	17	We must not underestimate the predominant share in the minds of voters of this covid and its pseudo current dangers, and its consequences on their choice of vote, which is further evidenced by the still too widespread wearing of the mask - not only useless but dangerous- at present.
2357	19	Almost everywhere the covid has disappeared and effective treatments have been proven in Algeria, India and equatorial Africa.
2357	21	But the media and lying doctors on TV sets have spread their venom. While waiting for them to pay, it is the naive ones who get bitten and vote for the enemy of the yellow vests.[4]
2357	23	The covidists are afraid of dying NOW, so the great replacement, and even the retirement age, the SMIG, the future of the children and of France, and even the purchasing power, it is no longer their problem. And yet they vote… It would have been necessary to speak their language to them, to think about it to find the words so well found for the rest.
2357	25	"The vax would not be forbidden to them and the other people are not dangerous, etc… We would continue to protect them… Some still are afraid of the wind during meetings in the street or at the office. You have to hear them, and talk to them. And don't sing ""talk to me about something else"", but rather how your friends and neighbors are doing and try to analyze with them the loss of periods in young girls or the heart attacks that have become really frequent among young athletes... Stress has good back..."
2358	1	For a racial approach to immigration
2358	3	Everywhere in the media are celebrated all these exotic tribes and their respective specificities.
2358	4	We are indignant that in China gigantic displacements of the Han population come to overwhelm these brave Muslim Uighurs, adorned with all the virtues.
2358	5	Concerning Africa, it is fashionable to fall in adoration in front of these multitudes of ethnic groups, each with its language, its customs, its religion. Everyone agrees that they must be respected and protected.
2358	6	As for the natives of Amazonia, they are simply deities.
2358	8	All these people are characterized by an approach to society that is ethnic (which can even be described as micro-ethnic for some, as they are fragmented), tribal and even clan-based for many of them.
2358	9	Anyone who would even dare to insinuate from near or far that many of these tribes are alike as two drops of water, would be immediately excommunicated by the left, accused of being racist and xenophobic.
2358	11	These ethno-tribal-clan social structures have existed for millennia and must be respected, promoted and sanctified. They embody Homo sapiens in all its original purity and, incidentally, allow university professors to have a job and students to do theses instead of pointing to Pôle Emploi.
2358	13	These people very rarely have an identity document. They don't need it, they recognize each other at a glance. With a simple look, an Utu knows whether he should cut a Tutsi with a machete or greet one of his brothers. Even in racially homogeneous countries like China, ethnic differences are obvious to everyone.
2358	15	The Africans and North Africans present on our territory categorize humans into four categories: Whites, Chinese, Arabs and Blacks. This distinction is obvious to them, and no one would have the absurd idea of ​​questioning it. Within their respective communities, Blacks and North Africans are just as naturally subdivided into nationalities, tribes and villages of origin. All this is perfectly normal in their eyes.
2358	17	In Europe, a few hours flight from France, there is a country artificially created by the UN, the United States and the EU, which is called Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many have forgotten it, but this golem was born on the corpse of the former Yugoslavia in 1992. Sick minds there wanted to play the sorcerer's apprentice by forcing three ethnic groups (Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims ) to share the same territory. A quick scan of the map shows the level of insanity of these two-penny demiurges.
2358	19	This pseudo-country is nothing more or less than a protectorate, with a kind of governor appointed by the UN, under the control of EUFOR, a European military force of around 14,000 soldiers.
2358	20	Thirty years after its creation, this monster is a failure. Secessionist currents are stronger than ever and interethnic antagonisms at their peak. The most fundamentalist versions of Islam thrive there, and the entire journalistic mafia continues to ignore the fact that terrorist training camps abound in the territory.
2358	22	The incredible Jean Quatremer, yet sold body and soul to Europe, declared on Arte that this project was doomed to failure because YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE TOGETHER.
2358	23	If Jean Quatremer, leftist, Europeanist and immigrationist is forced to admit it, he who once called rednecks all the French who had dared to vote against the Maastricht Treaty, we can take his word for it.
2358	25	Quatremer explains to us learnedly without flinching that it is all the same unthinkable to forcibly cohabit within the same country three white ethnic groups, who all speak more or less Serbo-Croatian and two of whom are Christians!
2358	26	All this is indisputable. It is necessary to take into account all the specificities and the various wishes of these populations.
2358	28	Uighurs, Bantus, Fulani, Australian Aborigines, Utus, Tutsis, Serbs, Croats, Kosovars, Berbers, we all recognize the right of them to affirm their ethnic and/or racial specificities, to assert them and even to be proud of them. .
2358	30	Well, what we celebrate for the peoples of the whole world, we deny to the French.
2360	3	In his interview with Le Parisien, Emmanuel Macron announced that he intended to “piss off” the non-vaccinated. At our microphone, he continued his reasoning: “To really piss off the unvaccinated, I decided to make the vaccination pass compulsory to access vaccination centers”. Thus, more than life, the President of the Republic will make vaccination impossible for the non-vaccinated.
2360	5	“And to make sure no irresponsible person approaches a vaccination center, I will place 2 MMA fighters at the entrance, each armed with a taser and a hungry dog. And not vaccinated the dog! Since they want natural medicine, they will treat rabies with rapeseed oil granules! said Emmanuel Macron before breaking into a laugh that shook the windows around us
2363	3	MOSCOW — In a televised address to the Russian people, Vladimir Putin announced that he had sent soldiers into the center of the Earth in order to “rid the earth’s inner core of Nazism. »
2363	5	“My parents fought against the German Nazis, and I will fight against hot spot volcanism,” the President of the Russian Federation said this afternoon before performing a judo hold on the globe. placed on his desk.
2363	7	"“This lava scum – what am I saying, this neo-Nazi lava scum – must be removed from geological power as soon as possible in order to facilitate the movement of our dear Eurasian tectonic plate”, continued the dictator who says he is eager to s to take over the planet's asthenosphere ""in order to liberate the iron, nickel and other minerals which are under the fascist yoke. »"
2363	9	According to the French intelligence services, the Russian soldiers have already started to penetrate the earth's crust, and they fear that if the lava does not surrender, the Russians will use drilling machines which vibrate so strongly that it tickles.
2363	11	"""The Russian president has always had a particular hatred for all kinds of geological strata, so I wouldn't be surprised if he went so far as to attack the central core of the Earth,"" explains Anne-Sophie Krafft, a French geologist."
2374	3	A major economic crisis, partly linked to the calamitous choices of the pandemic, is looming, bristling with inflation, energy rationing, uprisings and even international conflict. Covid, in all of this, weighs nothing.
2374	5	"The era is one of certified panic, of pythia labeled ""science"" and of risky predictions elevated to the rank of truth... Health, demography, climate, as Aider feared, man submitted to technology, as he said, yesteryear, to the Divine Creator. The future all mapped out, on the other hand, struggles to conform to the models... Our prodigies of leaders have rushed into the breach: basing their decisions on a scientifically validated future is a matter of providence."
2374	7	Unaware? Yes, without a doubt, but above all opportunists. They have their chicken guts 2.0, their deep learning coffee grounds. It remains to sort through the mass of forecasts in order to retain the one that serves their cause. Incidentally, everyone forgets or pretends to forget that error is part of the evolutionary process of science, but there is no question of stooping to the slightest skepticism, this skepticism which led Einstein to revolutionize physics: politics does not know subtlety.
2374	9	In the past, God ruled everything here below, but those times have passed: Nietzsche announced it to us 150 years ago, not doubting for a moment that new religions would replace their elders. Scientism killed Catholicism and we lost spirituality and eternal life in the process. Too bad… We still laugh at Dionysius the Little and the millennials, but are we really doing better?
2374	11	The Science God warned us in November 2020. We were heading towards 400,000 deaths. The president relayed the information and no one really flinched so we're doing it again, more discreetly: hear, hear, the epidemic will start again. You do not believe in it ? You doubt science. You are a pitiful obscurantist. A clarification: I practice in a covid center. I record the data on the dedicated professional sites on a daily basis. The disease exists and it has raged. It killed, mainly, within the population of very old and very tired men and, marginally, among the youngest, which distinguishes it from the seasonal flu.
2374	13	Mortality data ranks it among the pandemics of 1957 (Asian flu) and 1969 (Hong Kong flu). These would have claimed 4 million victims, but remember that then, for example among others, China and the USSR communicated in their own way... The counts have probably evolved over the past half-century. So, beware of comparisons, or even worse, as I read on a Mediapart article supposed to criticize the work of epidemiologist Laurent Toubiana, beware of comparisons of real data with estimates from simulations. Again and again them!
2374	15	Without sharing all of its moderate and widely argued positions, like my colleague, I think that the picture drawn up is not in harmony with reality. I remain convinced, considering the tensions and the very nature of the vaccine, that it should have been reserved for populations at risk. I remind you that certain prodigies (I include the President who has made us generations of refractories, with his claimed desire to annoy them) have dealt a severe blow to the vaccine cause, to which I am attached.
2374	17	At the origin of the health panic, the PCR, which generated a phenomenal financial mismanagement. Externality, through, according to our criteria of ignorant taxpayers, but does reckless spending only have an influence on the technocratic decision? State clerks brag all the more ostensibly as they gobble up billions in abysmal debts. They alone know how to make good use of what the paying pig gets in exchange for his sweat. Sweating is good enough for him.
2374	19	Acting reasonably exceeds his abilities, so the technocrat has the magnanimity to take charge of the expense side. In addition to these exciting wastes, the basic enarque was able, thanks to the PCR, to drool on the various platforms: he aligned the indexes and the neologisms, the incidence rates, the positivity rates and all this data with questionable values. Percentage forms the bulk of contemporary political discourse. Taxes, immigration, health, security, there is only that. The covid figures therefore made it possible to stun the béotiens and gently lead them to panic...
2374	21	At the start of the pandemic, everyone was destabilized and everything would have calmed down, but the rulers have, alas, taken charge of the situation. All the usual weapons in their arsenal were there, so how could you resist? They delimited the borders, designated the clans and they were able to divide, manipulate, push to the confrontation, distinguishing the friends from the enemies, the frightened braves from the ignoble obscurantists… Routine.
2374	23	The epidemic was going to destroy us, the services would be overwhelmed and the corpses would pile up unless… we submit to their injunctions. If one stooped to pay attention to these low-ceilinged obscurantists of conspiratorial antivax, it would be hell so some followed. What worked once should never happen again. We'll see: it's undeniable that people have been coughing and shivering in the cottages these past few days. Resuscitations, the only criterion I keep an eye on, are totally deserted (concerning covid, of course). There is a fifteen-day lag, so be patient.
2374	25	I find it hard to admit that in the absence of cases, of deaths, famous or not, of real patients, the population gives in to this panic which benefits all those who feed on the back of the beast, authorities, media, doctors on the plateaus, manufacturers of PCR, fans of work stoppages, financial aid from the State... Two camps are in confrontation: the bets are off.
2377	1	Emmanuel Macron will meet with global warming to ask him to immediately stop his aggression
2377	3	The president wishes once again to favor diplomacy to resolve the current crisis.
2377	5	The failure of negotiations to avoid conflict in Ukraine did not alter Emmanuel Macron's faith; it is indeed through dialogue that the Head of State hopes to resolve the new crisis that is hitting Europe” we will do everything to avoid an open war against global warming. We must avoid a decline that would directly affect the equity portfolio of the most fragile CAC 40 companies,” he said in a press release.
2377	7	The French president knows that he is walking on eggshells and that he will not be able to use too vindictive a tone during the negotiations “we must above all not humiliate global warming. Peace will not be built like that. “hammered the president to his European counterparts.
2379	3	"The volume of plastic will triple by 2060 in terms of use and waste. This is what the new report of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides on ""Global Plastics Outlook - Scenarios for Action to 2060"" published on Friday 3 June. Global use of plastics is expected to increase from 460 million tonnes (Mt) in 2019 to 1,231 Mt in 2060, while the volume of plastic waste produced is expected to jump from 353 (Mt) in 2019 to 1,014 Mt in 2060."
2379	5	Packaging is largely responsible for this. If they are not landfilled (which will concern 507 Mt of waste in 2060 if the trend is maintained), incinerated (for 179 Mt in 2060) or recycled (for 302 Mt in 2060), most of this waste ends up time in nature (for 153 Mt in 2060). As a result, annual plastic releases into the environment are expected to almost double, increasing from an average of 22 Mt in 2019 to 44 Mt in 2060. The stocks of plastics accumulated in the world's rivers and oceans are expected to increase by 140 Mt in 2019 to 493 Mt in 2060, a threefold increase.
2379	7	Whether for macroplastics (greater than 5 millimeters) or microplastics (less than 5 millimeters), the environmental consequences of this massive pollution are significant. Animals often become entangled in or ingest plastic debris, resulting in significant injury or even death, according to a 2018 WWF report. But human health is also increasingly affected: Decomposed plastic particles can end up in our organs and disrupt their functioning in the long term.
2385	1	“Geopolitics is changing”: expert Delyagin predicts a new scenario of the world order
2385	3	The balance of geopolitical forces is actively changing, as a result, political blocs are transforming their own roles and relationships with each other. If earlier EU member countries for the Russian Federation were the main “supplier” of innovation, today they have become a source of “real madness” — in an interview with the publication “Economy Today”, said Russian politician and economist Mikhail Delyagin.
2385	5	The gradual deterioration of relations between Russia and the countries of the European Union, caused by the reluctance of the latter to take decisions on their own, without the supervision of the United States, reached a critical point with the beginning of a special military operation, obliged to deploy the Kremlin on the territory which has become extremely dangerous, Ukraine.
2385	7	The large-scale punitive measures of economic restrictions against Russia included six voluminous sanctions packages, which had an extremely negative impact, first of all, on the economies of the member countries of the EU itself, rapidly moving towards recession.
2385	9	“Currently, there is an acute internal crisis in the countries of the European Union. The countries of the modern Western system have dug a hole for themselves, causing an energy and food crisis, causing massive influxes of migrants, the consequences of which are known”, – comments the expert.
2385	11	According to the expert, the social crisis caused by a major problem with migrants, will be another serious catalyst for the imminent collapse of Europe. Then the United States will follow, where an obvious election crisis, caused by the failure of Biden's policies and the rapid drop in his level of support, adds to a large number of problems.
2385	13	In the conditions when the countries of the Western system will desperately try to fight the above problems, Russia will be able to profitably use the chance to strengthen its own position of authority in the conditions of a new arrangement of geopolitical forces .
2385	15	“We are witnessing an absolute change in the development vector of the economy. The old economic system is obsolete — it was developed 3 centuries ago by financial speculators, in general, it is an area of ​​​​exchange of various types of goods. Basically, attention is paid to the tools of reproduction of material goods for each person personally - now everyone will be for himself, ”- believes Delyagin.
2385	17	Recall that a number of Western countries imposed large-scale anti-Russian economic restrictions which, contrary to the authors' expectations, proved unable to deal a significant blow to the Russian economy.
2386	1	Moldova risks losing its independence because of Western contests – ex-president Dodon
2386	3	The external course of the EU shows the exuberant rise of Russophobic sentiments and geopolitical hysteria. Today, a great challenge is issued by Europe and traditional values ​​— such a statement on the vast social networks published the former leader of Moldova Igor Dodon.
2386	5	"Ukraine's sensational European Union candidacy, according to the politician, was ""an inexpensive gift"" given to ""nezalezhnaya"" [independent Ukraine] for one purpose: to lure Kyiv deeply into insidious geopolitical productions under the shrewd leadership of Western European elites. And Ukraine in this scenario will be assigned the role itself unrepresentative."
2386	7	“In fact, we have become candidates for new political and military experiences, following the sad example of Ukraine. And the haste with which we took the candidates, as well as Ukraine, in the absence of reforms and a political regime of the ruling party, becoming dictatorial and rough violating the foundations of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms of citizens, confirmed that Moldova will play the role of a pawn on the geopolitical chessboard of the West”, – quotes RuBaltic.Ru.
2386	9	At the same time, Chisinau's thirst to become an active participant in the great Western game, will turn to the country with consequences of catastrophic magnitude, warns Dodon.
2386	11	“Due to the Russophobic policy carried out jointly with the West, we will not only lose profitable economic relations with our partners in the east, but also risk being left without part of our territories. As a result, Moldova as an independent state may disappear”, – underlined the former head of the country.
2386	13	Short-sighted and extremely dangerous, the current course of the Moldovan authorities is built on an aggressive and irresponsible basis, which in the near future will hit the innocent population of the country, — said the ex-president.
2386	15	“Statements by the country's leaders that EU candidate status obliges Moldova to adhere to anti-Russian sanctions are lies. For example, NATO member Turkey, which gained candidate status decades ago, has refused to back Western sanctions against Russia because they run counter to national interests. The war of the West with Russia is not our war”, – said the politician.
2386	17	The Moldovan authorities have forgotten the need for neutrality and the fundamental principles of sovereignty for a self-respecting state: the political course of Chisinau, according to Dodon, should be based solely on taking into account its own national interests, which are based on a mutually beneficial dialogue with the West and the East.
2386	19	Previously, Dodon had declared the extremely dire state of Moldova, noting that the country was barely poised on the brink of a global social, economic and energy crisis.
2386	21	Note, according to experts, today the Republic is desperately trying to “manage the two worlds”, finding itself at a very disadvantageous position, with great difficulty and fear of choosing another political course of action.
