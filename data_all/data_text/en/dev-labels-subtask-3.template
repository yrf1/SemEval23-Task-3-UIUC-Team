813452859	1	EU Profits From Trading With UK While London Loses Money – Political Campaigner
813452859	3	With the Parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan set to be held next month; President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has criticised the UK’s preparations for their departure from the EU.
813452859	4	But is there any chance that May's deal will make it through parliament and if it fails, how could this ongoing political deadlock finally come to an end?
813452859	5	Sputnik spoke with political campaigner Michael Swadling for more…
813452859	6	Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of getting her deal through Parliament on the 14th January?
813452859	7	Michael Swadling: I guess her only chance is if Labour decides that they want to dishonour democracy and effectively keep us in the EU.

813452859	9	There is a chance; as unfortunately there are many MPs who don't respect the vote and may just turn on it, but short of that I don't see any way the Conservatives would vote for it, and the majority is slender as it is, as the DUP is bitterly against it, and I can't see the Lib Dems voting for it, so it will only be if there are enough, what I can describe as remoaner MPs, that the deal won't be dead in the water.
813452859	10	Sputnik: What could be a solution to the political chaos if the Prime Minister's deal is not approved?
813452859	11	Michael Swadling: The EU withdrawal act is in place; we'll leave and revert to WTO terms and that works, that's fine.
813452859	12	I often use the example of an iPhone to people; that's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China, uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms, this isn't a fantasy, stuck in a port somewhere, there isn't a massive tariff, this is the world that really exists today.
813452859	13	When we exit the EU on WTO terms; that will be fine for whatever trading we do with the EU, just as well as it does for our trade in China.READ MORE: UK Finance Chief Bashed for Failing to Unlock Money for No-Deal Brexit — Reports
813452859	14	Sputnik: Do you think that the EU needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU?
813452859	15	Michael Swadling: The EU makes a profit on its trade with the UK; the UK makes a loss on its trade with the EU.
813452859	16	They have a financial incentive to ensure that good trading relations continue far more than we do.

813494037	3	The spectacular fireworks that lit up the London sky on Monday night caused a stir on social media over the display's pro-EU message, at a time when the nation is divided over its looming withdrawal from the bloc.
813494037	4	London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced mounting criticism after the capital's New Year's Eve fireworks display, which celebrated ties with the European Union, left a bad taste in the mouths of some Brits.
813494037	5	The 135-metre-high London Eye was lit up in blue while its tubs turned yellow, with the giant Ferris wheel resembling the star-studded flag of the European Union.Sadiq Khan called his fireworks display a "message of support" to EU citizens living in London.
813494037	6	"Our one million EU citizens are Londoners, they make a huge contribution, and no matter the outcome of Brexit — they will always be welcome", he said.
813494037	7	To the one million EU citizens who have made our city your home: you are Londoners, you make a huge contribution and you are welcome here.
813494037	8	I'm proud that tonight we will welcome in the new year with a message of support to you.

813494037	10	However, a host of Londoners rushed to Twitter to accuse their mayor of "politicising" the celebrations — with some are even calling for his resignation.
813494037	11	I cannot believe this event has been politicised.
813494037	12	This man has no shame.
813494037	13	Just resign.

813494037	15	Thanks a lot Sadiq Khan you ruined the fireworks display by talking about Europe, need I remind you about Brexit.
813494037	16	You have started of the new year by talking about relationships with the European Union.

813494037	29	The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 via a nationwide referendum, with 51.9 per cent voting in favour of pulling out of the bloc, while 48.1 per cent wanted to remain.
813494037	30	The withdrawal is scheduled for the end of March; the Article 50 deadline.
813494037	31	The Remain sentiment dominated London, with nearly 60 percent of voters wanting Britain to stay in the European Union.
813494037	32	Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Remainer himself, earlier called for a second referendum on Brexit.
813494037	33	"The government's abject failure — and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a 'no deal' Brexit — means that giving people a fresh say is now the right — and only — approach left for our country," he said in September.
813547724	1	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the UK should not 'underestimate its strength' after Brexit
813547724	3	Post-Brexit Britain should use its power to defend democracy around the world, Jeremy Hunt will say today.
813547724	4	The Foreign Secretary will insist the UK should not 'underestimate' its strength.
813547724	5	'We are not a superpower and we do not have an empire,' he will say in a speech in Singapore.
813547724	6	'But we do have the fifth-biggest economy in the world, the third-biggest overseas aid budget, the second-biggest military budget in Nato, one of the two biggest financial centres, the world's language, highly effective intelligence services and a world-class diplomatic network.
813547724	7	'We also have immense reserves of soft power, with three of the world's top ten universities, 450,000 international students, 39million visits by tourists in 2017, and a global audience for our media, especially the BBC, measured in the hundreds of millions.'
813547724	8	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit.
813547724	9	He is pictured in Myanmar before Christmas
813547724	10	Mr Hunt will point to Britain's links with the Commonwealth, the United States and Europe, saying: 'Those connections are why Britain's post-Brexit role should be to act as an invisible chain linking together the democracies of the world ... who share our values and support our belief in free trade, the rule of law and open societies.
813547724	11	'We should begin by being realistic about our global position.
813547724	12	That means not overestimating our strength but not underestimating it either.'
813547724	13	Mr Hunt will highlight worrying figures showing that 71 countries saw reversals of political and civil liberties in 2017.
813547724	14	He will sign a 'strategic partnership' with Singapore covering areas including defence and education.
813552066	1	You insult us, ambassador: Woody Johnson flagrantly abused special relationship, says PETER OBORNE
813552066	3	With three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through Parliament.
813552066	4	Next week, MPs will reassemble at Westminster — and the following week, they will vote on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.
813552066	5	If they vote it down, Britain will be plunged into the greatest constitutional crisis in more than 100 years.
813552066	6	Mrs May might even resign and a new prime minister take over.
813552066	7	The stakes could not be higher.
813552066	8	U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit
813552066	9	Into this national crisis of epic proportions has just waded the clodhopping U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson.
813552066	10	On Monday, Mr Johnson foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May’s premiership.
813552066	11	He informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit.
813552066	12	Lethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain’s closest ally and strategic partner — with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II.
813552066	13	This brutal attack by Donald Trump’s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her — and Britain’s — future.
813552066	14	All the more so since he held out the carrot of a ‘quick, very massive bilateral trade deal’ .

813552066	19	Ambassador to U.K. Woody Johnson as he leaves the latter's residence in London
813552066	20	Notorious
813552066	21	Furthermore, Mr Johnson’s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James’s.
813552066	22	The first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics.
813552066	23	Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest.
813552066	24	By implication, Mr Johnson has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘losers’ whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account.
813552066	25	There is no defence of Mr Johnson’s conduct.
813552066	26	And no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement.
813552066	27	Mr Johnson, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy.
813552066	28	This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party.
813552066	29	Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush’s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run.
813552066	30	The switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism.
813552066	31	But then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as Johnson to important ambassadorial jobs.
813552066	32	Take Lana Marks, the President’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
813552066	33	She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities.
813552066	34	In common with an embarrassing number of Trump’s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump’s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members’ resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website.
813552066	35	Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump’s presidential campaign.
813552066	36	Everything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump.
813552066	37	And, in December, Trump’s administration put forward as America’s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy.
813552066	38	Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals
813552066	39	Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers.
813552066	40	In truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions.
813552066	41	Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. ambassador to London.
813552066	42	Woody Johnson cannot be classed in their company.
813552066	43	This scion of the industrial company Johnson & Johnson — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division.
813552066	44	Outcry
813552066	45	Twelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm’s involvement in tax avoidance schemes.
813552066	46	Johnson said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful.
813552066	47	However, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest.
813552066	48	In Britain, such a record could have debarred Johnson from further involvement in public life.
813552066	49	And the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry.
813552066	50	But then, it’s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody Johnson did with Mrs May on New Year’s Eve.
813552066	51	Of course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House.
813552066	52	Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President
813552066	53	He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump’s America.
813552066	54	Or on the progress of Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President.
813552066	55	Squirming
813552066	56	He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President.
813552066	57	Above all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
813552066	58	I should point out that Mr Johnson did say that Britain’s future was ‘extremely positive, extremely bright’.
813552066	59	But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister.
813552066	60	Professional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP.
813552066	61	I can’t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody Johnson.
813552066	62	So when Trump’s crony Johnson turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage.
813552066	63	The fact is that Johnson is out of his depth.
813552066	64	Like his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S.
813552066	65	If the President won’t rein him in — and I’m not holding my breath — Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act.
813552066	66	And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.

813602345	1	New year ushered in with fireworks and European solidarity
813602345	3	The words “London is open” rang in the new year as the capital welcomed 2019 with a dazzling riverside fireworks display.
813602345	4	The phrase was spoken in seven languages around two minutes past midnight as the city skyline filled with lights in the largest annual display in Europe.

813602345	12	The display lit up London (Yui Mok/PA)
813602345	13	“I think the Government’s made a mess of negotiations with the European Union,” Mr Khan continued.
813602345	14	“Bearing in mind Parliament can’t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government,” he said.
813602345	15	He vowed that London would remain the same after March 29 2019, and said the fireworks display was about “showing the world, while they’re watching us, that we’re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic”.
813602345	16	Some 100,000 ticket-holders lined the banks of the Thames to watch 70,000 projectiles made up of eight tonnes of fireworks fire into the sky from three barges and the London Eye.

813602345	18	Mr Khan continued: “We, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world, one of the reason we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans.”
813602345	19	“I think diversity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that diversity.
813602345	20	“I hope that members of Parliament, members of the Government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March.”
813603860	1	Labour activists 'could QUIT the party over Corbyn's Brexit referendum stance'
813603860	3	Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
813603860	4	The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
813603860	5	Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
813603860	6	But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
813603860	7	There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
813603860	8	The research underlined the scale of the challenge Jeremy Corbyn faces from Labour members, with thousands considering quitting, nearly a quarter believing he is a Brexiteer, and nearly three quarters wanting a new referendum
813603860	9	Attending a rail fare protest in central London today, Mr Corbyn again dodged as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists on Brexit
813603860	10	The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
813603860	11	Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
813603860	12	Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said:'Our survey of Labour's grassroots clearly shows that Corbyn's apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labour's members want, and it doesn't reflect the views of most Labour voters either.''
813603860	13	Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, Mr Corbyn said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
813603860	14	'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
813603860	15	'This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.
813603860	16	It's finally going to take place the second week of January.
813603860	17	That is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago.
813603860	18	This Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May's deal.
813603860	19	'Well both of those options are completely unacceptable.'
813603860	20	The work was carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project.
813603860	21	Some 29 per cent of Labour's rank-and-file members said they oppose the stance that the party has taken on Brexit - and 56 per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting.
813603860	22	That proportion would be equivalent to around 88,000 members, according to the project's analysis.
813603860	23	If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some 88 per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, 3 per cent said they would leave with Theresa May's deal and 5 per cent would support leaving with no deal.
813603860	24	If the choice was between the Prime Minister's deal and leaving the EU without an agreement, some 27 per cent of Labour members said they would boycott the vote altogether, although 46 per cent said they would take Mrs May's deal.
813603860	25	Some 89 per cent of Labour members - compared with 65 per cent of current Labour voters and only 45 per cent of all voters - are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.
813603860	26	While just 35 per cent of the electorate as a whole believe that warnings of short-term disruption with potential problems for food and medicine supplies in a no-deal Brexit are realistic, that figure rises to 82 per cent of Labour members and 58 per cent of Labour voters.
813603860	27	Prof Bale said: 'Our survey suggests Labour's membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end.
813603860	28	Theresa May (pictured delivering her New Year message) has been battling to get her Brexit deal through Parliament
813603860	29	'It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party's members on either count, are in the same camp.
813603860	30	'Labour's grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.
813603860	31	'As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour's leader to get off the fence.'
813603860	32	Labour MP Phil Wilson said: 'An overwhelming majority of Labour's voters, as well as its members, want the public to have the final say on Brexit and to stay in the European Union.
813603860	33	'But the leadership has too often hidden behind myths that Labour is almost evenly divided on this issue when the clear evidence from this and other polls shows that it is the leadership which is increasingly out of step with its supporters.'
813603860	34	The Sedgefield MP added: 'Labour's leadership now has a huge opportunity to be at the front of a popular campaign against the Government's Brexit deal and make sure the public are given the right to have the final say in the form of a People's Vote.
813603860	35	'I urge Jeremy to seize this chance to change the course of history, before it's too late.'
813603860	36	YouGov surveyed 1,034 Labour Party members between December 17 and 21 2018.
813603860	37	The pollster also surveyed a representative sample of 1,675 British adults on December 18-19.
813623212	1	'Wishful thinking': Tory MPs dismiss May's hopes for change of heart on Brexit deal
813623212	3	Jeremy Hunt insisted Theresa May can still salvage her Brexit deal today - despite Tory MPs branding her hopes of getting it through Parliament 'wishful thinking'.
813623212	4	The Foreign Secretary said he believed the PM will 'find a way' to win the looming Commons vote by getting assurances with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop is only temporary.
813623212	5	But senior Conservatives said they were detecting no sign of a shift in opinion over the Christmas break, warning that 'nothing has changed'.
813623212	6	Brexit hostilities have been resumed with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.
813623212	7	The moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.
813623212	8	The premier used her New Year message to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'.
813623212	9	She said passing the deal would mean the UK can thrive and 'start a new chapter with optimism and hope'.
813623212	10	Mr Hunt added his voice to the pleas today, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'.
813623212	11	On a trip to Singarpore today, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added his voice to the pleas to Tory MPs, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'

813623212	13	Senior Tories Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood are among those who have renewed their vow to oppose the Brexit deal
813623212	14	Speaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.
813623212	15	'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.
813623212	16	'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.
813623212	17	'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.
813623212	18	'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'
813623212	19	Mr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.
813623212	20	'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.
813623212	21	'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.
813623212	22	'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'
813623212	23	He also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.
813623212	24	Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.
813623212	25	Mrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.
813623212	26	But the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.
813623212	27	The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.
813623212	28	However, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.
813623212	29	Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.
813623212	30	Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.
813623212	31	And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.

813623212	41	Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.
813623212	42	'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.
813623212	43	'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'
813623212	44	Sir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.
813623212	45	'Parliament exists to make our laws.
813623212	46	This Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'
813623212	47	Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.
813623212	48	'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.
813623212	49	'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.
813623212	50	They would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'
813623212	51	Another senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'
813623212	52	They added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...
813623212	53	'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'
813623212	54	Mr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.
813623212	55	He said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.
813623212	56	'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.
813623212	57	'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'
813623212	58	Mr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.

813714967	3	This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com
813714967	4	Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff
813714967	5	Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
813714967	6	Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff
813714967	8	Migrants from France arriving in Dover, England, this week (SPLASH)
813714967	9	It is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.
813714967	10	Britain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.
813714967	11	Now the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.
813714967	12	The problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).
813714967	13	Ireland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as “The Troubles,” which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.
813714967	14	It has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the “Brexiteers” (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier-free border.
813714967	15	So that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.
813714967	16	So there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:
813714967	17	“Crashing out of the EU” – a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	18	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan.
813714967	19	Killing the whole Brexit thing.
813714967	20	Kicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.
813714967	21	There is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	22	In my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.
813714967	23	I had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two-year notice on March 29, 2017.
813714967	24	However, in the last few months, an E.U.
813714967	25	court has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two-year negotiation.
813714967	26	So that is an option.
813714967	27	However, if Britain’s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.
813714967	28	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.
813714967	29	The whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.
813714967	30	regulations, E.U.
813714967	31	taxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
813714967	32	In the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.
813714967	33	This plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.
813714967	34	However, few people like Theresa May’s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.
813714967	35	That brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.
813714967	36	It is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.
813714967	37	would agree to extend the March 29 date.
813714967	38	That would give time for more debate.
813714967	39	Some people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.
813714967	40	The problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.
813714967	41	Would it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?
813714967	42	Or would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?
813714967	43	So really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to “fudge,” or to kick the can down the road.

813714967	45	Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
813714967	46	A big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.
813714967	47	There are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants €15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.
813714967	48	At the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.
813714967	49	However, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.
813714967	50	This is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.
813714967	51	It is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.
813714967	52	border force has been patrolling the waters.
813714967	53	But political pressure has forced Britain’s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.
813714967	54	Many of the migrants are from Iran.
813714967	55	This is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa-free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.
813714967	56	More than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.
813714967	57	The trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross-currents can make the trip much longer.
813714967	58	The trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.
813714967	59	If a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.
813714967	60	When a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.
813714967	61	Iranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran’s human rights record.
813714967	62	For that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.

813949697	1	Police training up for deployment to NI in case of no-deal Brexit
813949697	3	Almost 1,000 police officers are being trained up for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of violence stemming from a no-deal Brexit.
813949697	4	Chiefs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland had asked for the reinforcements to handle any problems that may arise from a hard border.
813949697	5	It is thought large numbers of officers from Britain on the streets could anger Irish republicans.
813949697	6	But additional officers are thought to be necessary to cover the possibility of violence with a no-deal Brexit.
813949697	7	Cars burn during Nationalist rioting in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast, Northern Ireland on July 12, 2010.
813949697	8	The rioting started after the police forced the Protestant Orangemen's traditional 12 July parade against the wishes of a group of Nationalist residents
813949697	9	The training will mean officers are pulled from their regular duties, according to The Guardian.
813949697	10	News of the continued no-deal Brexit preparations came on another difficult day for Theresa May.
813949697	11	What is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?
813949697	12	The so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.
813949697	13	This is what it means: What is the backstop?
813949697	14	The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal.
813949697	15	The divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition if that deal is not in place.If effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market..
813949697	16	This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.
813949697	17	It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.
813949697	18	Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it?
813949697	19	Because Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.
813949697	20	This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal.
813949697	21	But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.
813949697	22	Why do critics hate it?
813949697	23	Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.
813949697	24	Getting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.
813949697	25	Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom..
813949697	26	What concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?
813949697	27	During the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.
813949697	28	Importantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea - even if some goods still need to be checked.
813949697	29	The Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments - meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.
813949697	30	It also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal - promises it says can be enforced in court.
813949697	31	What did the legal advice say about it?
813949697	32	Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.
813949697	33	This would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.
813949697	34	The DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.
813949697	35	After a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.''
813949697	36	Mr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.
813949697	37	However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.
813949697	38	Mr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.
813949697	39	He said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'
813949697	40	Mr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.
813949697	41	The remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.
813949697	42	Mr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.
813949697	43	A spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the leaders of the remaining 27 countries 'have been very clear' that what is on the table 'will not be renegotiated'.
813949697	44	At a press conference in Brussels, Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held before the Commons has its say on the deal in the week of January 14.
813949697	45	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	46	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	47	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: 'For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
813949697	48	She said Mr Juncker is 'always willing to listen to Mrs May's views on the backstop', but when asked what else he can do to help her deal get through Parliament, she rebuffed any chance of altering the backstop as it currently stands.
813949697	49	And Mrs May's deal drew criticism from Tory former minister Ben Gummer, who co-authored the Conservative manifesto at the last election.
813949697	50	Mr Gummer, who lost his Ipswich seat at the 2017 election, said it would leave the country poorer for generations.
813949697	51	He told the BBC: 'I think it is probably unique in modern parliamentary history, because Members of Parliament are being asked to walk through the division lobbies to make the country, and their constituents, permanently poorer and less secure.
813949697	52	'Not just in one generation, but in two or three.'
813949697	53	Mr Gummer said if Parliament failed to find a route through the Brexit situation, a new referendum should be held.
813949697	54	The comments came as Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be 'considerable' in the agricultural sector.

813949697	57	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal, Dublin warns
813949697	58	Irish agriculture minister Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit
813949697	59	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc, the country's agriculture minister warned today.
813949697	60	Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit - with beef, dairy and fishing among the most vulnerable sectors.
813949697	61	The warning came as Brussels again appeared to dismiss Theresa May's plea for fresh concessions to help her get the Brexit package through the Commons later this month.
813949697	62	An EU commission spokeswoman also said there were no plans for any further negotiations with the UK - despite the PM insisting talks are ongoing.
813949697	63	The latest standoff has sent the chances of a no-deal Brexit spiralling, as Mrs May looks down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14.
813949697	64	Killing off the plan could throw the government into chaos, with the UK set to crash out of the bloc by default at the end of March unless politicians can agree another course.
813949697	65	Irish PM Leo Varadkar is seen as having been one of the main obstacles to sealing a deal, after he insisted on a 'backstop' to guarantee no hard border with Northern Ireland.
813949697	66	The DUP has condemned the proposals because they risk splitting the UK, while Brexiteers say it will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere.
813949697	67	However, the intervention by Mr Creed today underlines the threat of disruption Ireland faces if there is no Brexit deal.
813949697	68	Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) is looking down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14
813949697	69	Speaking about the need for support from the EU in the event of no deal, he told the Irish Independent: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
813949697	70	'Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
813949697	71	Nearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain, according to 2016 government figures.
813949697	72	The country is also considered a vital 'land bridge' to the European continent
813949697	73	'There is a high level of awareness of Ireland's unique exposure to the UK food market,' Mr Creed said.
813949697	74	'I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.'
813949697	75	But, he added: 'In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.
813949697	76	If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April.
813949697	77	Dublin outlined its no deal contingency plans before the Christmas break.
813949697	78	They include schemes for port overhauls, a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island's integrated electricity network.
813949697	79	Up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required.
813949697	80	At a press conference in Brussels this morning Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held with the UK before the Commons vote.
813949697	81	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	82	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	83	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, and confirmed Brussels is ready to start preparations on a new trade deal 'immediately after the signature' on the deal from the UK Government.
813949697	84	She added: 'For now no further meetings are foreseen between the commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
813953273	1	RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The capital sees its first stabbings of the year
813953273	3	Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang from gatecrashing a party in Mayfair
813953273	4	The Page One headline in the Evening Standard said it all: ‘First Stab Victims Of The New Year.’ Welcome to 2019.
813953273	5	Call me old-fashioned, but when I worked on the Standard, admittedly in prehistoric times, the front page was more likely to feature the first baby born in one of London’s maternity hospitals.
813953273	6	On Wednesday, the photographs were of a security guard and a young mother knifed to death within a few miles of each other.
813953273	7	Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang dressed in designer clothes from gatecrashing a sordid sex party at an exclusive address in Mayfair.
813953273	8	Charlotte Huggins was murdered in her own home in Camberwell, South London.
813953273	9	Both victims were 33 years old.
813953273	10	Elsewhere, a man was stabbed in the street in Blackheath and was said to be critically ill in hospital.
813953273	11	Mr Simionov had only been in Britain for two months, moving here from Romania with his fiancee in search of a better life.He died at the scene, in Park Lane, after being attacked by up to ten men — including, allegedly, the 26-year-old son of Finsbury Park firebrand Captain Hook, the Islamist hate preacher currently serving life for terrorism offences in an American supermax jail.
813953273	12	His son, Imran Mostafa Kamel, was remanded on firearms charges yesterday and remains a suspect in the murder..
813953273	13	Two other security guards and a woman aged 29 were also stabbed and were treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries.
813953273	14	Flowers left on the pavement outside the entrance of the party in Mayfair, where security guard Simionov was stabbed to death
813953273	15	Park Lane, like the rest of central London, was teeming with drunken revellers seeing in the New Year.
813953273	16	The manager of a local garage said he had called the police to a crowd fighting and menacing his customers a couple of hours before the fatal stabbing.
813953273	17	He said they came and went around 3am.
813953273	18	To be fair, police resources are always stretched at New Year.
813953273	19	But routine foot patrols are thin on the ground at the best of times.
813953273	20	I was at a black tie ball in Park Lane shortly before Christmas.
813953273	21	When I left after midnight there was no sign of a copper anywhere.
813953273	22	Pounding the beat has long since slipped down the Met’s list of priorities.
813953273	23	These days they tend to respond to crime after the event, rather than seeking to prevent it.
813953273	24	That’s not to question the bravery of individual officers, as exemplified by the British Transport Police who tackled the Islamist nutjob who stabbed three people, including a police sergeant, at Manchester’s Victoria station this week.
813953273	25	But a visible police presence may have deterred the gang who killed Tudor Simionov.Sadiq Khan arrives for a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix Park, Dublin
813953273	27	No doubt London’s two-bob chancer of a Mayor Sadiq Khan would blame the absence of police on the streets on ‘austerity’ or the ‘Tory cuts’.
813953273	28	Maybe if he hadn’t splurged £2.3 million of taxpayers’ money on a vainglorious New Year fireworks display, he could have diverted more money to the Met to put extra bobbies on the beat.
813953273	29	Some of this largesse was frittered away turning the London Eye into a blue and yellow EU flag, as part of a cynical, self-serving propaganda stunt aimed at bolstering the Stop Brexit campaign and burnishing the image of the Mayor himself.
813953273	30	I wonder if Tudor Simionov was aware of Khan’s New Year message boasting that London would remain open after Brexit, broadcast in a number of foreign languages, including Romanian.
813953273	31	No one has ever suggested London won’t stay open when we leave the EU.
813953273	32	This was pure political posturing, at our expense.
813953273	33	The majority of Londoners may have backed Remain, but the really significant statistic is that more voted Leave (1.5 million) than voted for Khan (1.3 million).
813953273	34	What’s most likely to deter immigrants from coming here is not Khan slandering Leave voters as knuckle-scraping, racist bigots, but the news that someone can be stabbed to death on one of London’s busiest, best-known and most upmarket streets within two months of arriving in the country seeking a better future.
813953273	35	Under Khan, there has been an explosion of violent crime.
813953273	36	In addition to the New Year stabbings, a woman was shot in a nightclub in Hackney on the same night.
813953273	37	A day earlier, 39 people were arrested in Hammersmith on suspicion of attempted murder after another stabbing at a party.
813953273	38	We are all now familiar with the fact that last year London’s murder rate overtook New York.
813953273	39	There were 134 violent deaths in 2018, an increase of 15 per cent.
813953273	40	And if that chilling reality doesn’t put people off moving here from overseas, then perhaps they may be dissuaded by the paralysis on London’s roads and the exorbitant cost of housing — two key problems Khan has exacerbated, rather than solved
813953273	41	He promised 80,000 new homes a year, yet in the 12 months to last April built just over 5,300.
813953273	42	London’s economy may be steaming ahead (no thanks to Khan) but public services are deteriorating.The streets are dirtier, rubbish piles up uncollected late at night, public transport is horribly overcrowded and traffic is gridlocked as a deliberate consequence of the Mayor’s policies.
813953273	43	Rough sleepers and aggressive beggars are a permanent fixture in the West End.
813953273	44	Yet while innocent blood runs in the gutters, and police budgets are restrained, Khan indulges in fatuous propaganda stunts, whether floating a Donald Trump blimp over London or turning a traditional New Year’s party into a pro-EU festival of political hubris.
813953273	45	And instead of being able to celebrate an optimistic start to 2019, London’s evening paper has a splash headline marking the first stabbings of the year.
813953273	46	The first of many more to come, no doubt.
813953273	47	Makes you proud to be British.
813953435	1	Majority of Tory voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's deal
813953435	3	Conservative voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, a major survey reveals today.
813953435	4	In a rare glimmer of hope for the Prime Minister, the poll finds that Tory voters back her deal by 46 per cent to 38.
813953435	5	While a majority of voters across all parties (53 per cent) said Mrs May had failed to get a good deal – they also believed any alternative leader would have fared 'just as badly' in negotiations with the EU.
813953435	6	Tory voters back Theresa May's deal by 46 per cent to 38, according to a new survey
813953435	7	But an accompanying survey of Conservative Party members paints a far gloomier picture, with activists opposed to the deal negotiated by their own leader by 59 per cent to 38.
813953435	8	The research, co-ordinated by Professor Tim Bale of London's Queen Mary University, also reveals that Tory members are convinced a no-deal Brexit would be better than Mrs May's plan.
813953435	9	More than half of members polled (57 per cent) said their first preference was to leave with no deal.
813953435	10	Dublin 'mega-money' warning over Brexit Ireland last night warned Brussels it will demand 'mega-money' in the form of aid if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
813953435	11	Ireland's agriculture minister said a no-deal Brexit would have a crippling effect on his country's agriculture sector – which depends heavily on trade with the UK.
813953435	12	He said his country's farmers had been hit by the devaluation of sterling since Brexit, but said: 'A hard Brexit would make that look like a teddy bears' picnic.'
813953435	13	He added: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
813953435	14	Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
813953435	15	EU diplomats fear this could spark claims by other countries likely to be hit by a no-deal Brexit.
813953435	16	The figure is more than double the 25 per cent of the population as a whole who would plump for no deal.
813953435	17	The hardline stance of most Tory members will dismay Mrs May's allies, who had hoped that activists would use the Christmas break to pressure their rebellious MPs to fall into line.
813953435	18	But having the support of Tory voters – who will decide the party's electoral fate – does provide a crumb of comfort.
813953435	19	Downing Street will also be encouraged by a finding that 40 per cent of members said their second preference was to leave with Mrs May's deal, suggesting they could live with the compromise.
813953435	20	And the study found that if Mrs May's deal was pitted directly against the option of Remain in a second referendum, Tory members would grudgingly back her plan by 57 per cent to 18.
813953435	21	The PM was forced to postpone a vote on her Brexit deal last month after Tory whips warned she faced a crushing defeat, with more than 100 of her own MPs threatening to vote against.
813953435	22	The crunch vote is now due to be held on or around January 15.
813953435	23	But there are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart.
813953435	24	A senior source acknowledged that, with just ten days to go before the vote, the situation was 'still looking pretty challenging'.
813953435	25	Professor Bale said the findings indicated that activists were 'if anything, even less impressed than MPs' with her deal.
813953435	26	Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said the new polling made it clear Mrs May's deal was unacceptable to the party.
813953435	27	There are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart, according to a new survey
813953435	28	'If No 10 thought the Christmas and New Year break would make a difference then they have been proved wrong,' he said.
813953435	29	'The pressure coming from members is to kill off this deal, not support it.'
813953435	30	With 83 per cent of members opposed to a second referendum, it suggests any future leadership candidate proposing one would lose.
813953435	31	The research was produced by the Party Members Project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
813992175	1	Dreadful Brexit Deal: All EU States Could Ask UK For Trading Concessions - Prof
813992175	3	Barely two days have passed since the New Year and the remoaners are doing what they do best.
813992175	4	Fear mongering.
813992175	5	Unfortunately the British Parliament appears to be infested with them, as there is speculation that the government will begin a publicity campaign, aiming to warn of potential adverse effects of a no deal departure.
813992175	6	But would this outcome be as bad as so often claimed in the mainstream media?
813992175	7	And would it be preferable to Prime Minister Theresa May’s much maligned Chequers plan?
813992175	8	Sputnik spoke with UKIP founder Alan Sked for more insight on the issue.
813992175	9	Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of passing her Brexit deal?
813992175	10	And why is it so bad?
813992175	11	Alan Sked: It’s very difficult for her to pass it because it is very bad, as we have to pay the EU thirty nine billion pounds and we don’t get very much in return.
813992175	12	It sets up a two year transition period, during which we, in effect; remain members of the EU, but we don’t have any say in decision maker’s decisions that they take, we’d just have to accept whatever rules and regulations they pass without being able to influence or veto them.
813992175	13	© AFP 2018 / PRAKASH SINGH Indian Migrants Will Not Face Problems Until the Brexit Process is Over - Minister
813992175	14	Then there’s another thing that says; if we don’t get a free trade agreement by the end of the transition period, we’d enter a thing called the backstop that comes into play to safeguard the Irish border, which means that Britain and Northern Ireland become part of the single market and customs union.
813992175	15	We couldn’t get out of it; it goes on indefinitely and we’ve got no means of unilaterally exiting, we’d have to get the permission of the EU to come out, and if we want that permission, we’d have to get that permission from the twenty seven different countries, and each one of them could ask for trading concessions in order to get their permission, so it’s a dreadful deal.
813992175	16	Sputnik: Are WTO rules now the solution to the ongoing political deadlock?
813992175	17	Alan Sked: WTO’s a perfect solution.
813992175	18	We trade with America, China, India and most of the world under WTO rules already and different parts trade with each other on these rules.
813992175	19	The EU trades with America, China, India and different places on WTO rules; we’re set up to trade with large parts of the world already in that way so it won’t make very much difference.
813992175	20	I’d be very happy with WTO rules.

814251296	1	UK Govt to Perform No Deal Brexit Dress Rehearsal with 150 Trucks
814251296	3	The British government is going to wargame the impact of leaving the European Union on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on Monday, chartering dozens of articulated lorries to simulate the impact of traffic near the port of Dover.
814251296	4	After years of ignoring the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union fully and without a deal keeping it tied to the rules and regulations of the bloc, the British government is now apparently rushing to make preparations.
814251296	5	One of these is a trial by the Department of Transport to examine using the former Manston airport in Kent as a lorry park in case of congestion around the Port of Dover, one of the main points of cross-Channel traffic with Europe.
814251296	6	Up to 150 large trucks will be parked and released from the airfield at 0800 and 1100 Monday morning to test the utility of the site to relieve pressure on Kentish roads including the M20, which can become extremely busy when there are delays at the ferry port.
814251296	7	An email from the Department for Transport send to Cliffsend Parish Council reported by Kent Online said of the test: “The use of Manston airfield as an HGV holding facility is one of the traffic management measures as part of the current draft plan to alleviate congestion on Kent roads in the event of any disruption at the border.

814251296	9	“This also now includes if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, should there be any disruption… Staff will be positioned along the whole route throughout the trial to monitor flows.
814251296	10	If required at any time, flows from Manston can be halted as needed.”
814251296	11	The plan is a variant of Kent Police’s Operation Stack, which uses the M20 as a giant lorry park while leaving one lane open for other traffic in the case of the Port of Dover being closed to traffic.It was activated dozens of times in 2015 when industrial action and  illegal migrantscongregating at the Port of Calais — from which much of Dover’s traffic flows from and to — effectively halted the flow of ships and Eurotunnel freight trains.

814251296	13	The delays were so bad the British government even drew up plans to deploy the British Army to help control traffic in the south of England as instability in northern France prevented the free flow of trade.
814251296	14	As well as managing traffic in Kent to prepare for a potential resumption of border checks on trucks, the government has also handed out a number of contracts to reopen ferry routes to other ports, many of which have seen their services closed in recent years.
814251296	15	One of those is Ramsgate, which is now being dredged to take ships carrying 3,000 lorries a day after Brexit.

814403543	3	Prime Minister Theresa May may again push back the final House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement in face of continued opposition by Brexiteer MPs, according to sources speaking to The Telegraph.
814403543	4	MPs return to the House of Commons to debate the agreement next week and Mrs May’s aides are said to be drawing up a plan to make approval of the deal conditional on obtaining further reassurances from the European Union over the Irish backstop, according to the conservative broadsheet.
814403543	5	The vote was postponed in December in face of certain defeat relating to objections from Brexit-supporting MPs that the backstop could lock Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the bloc and threaten the Union.
814403543	6	With the vote pencilled in for the week beginning January 15th, Downing Street still has not come closer to assuaging those concerns, according to insiders, particularly for the 10 Northern Irish DUP MPs that May’s Conservative government rely on.
814403543	7	The prime minister’s advisors are considering making approval of the deal “subject to” May’s Government obtaining assurances that the Irish backstop will be temporary.
814403543	8	Former Downing Street director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa told The Telegraph, “Getting conditional approval isn’t enough for the Government to go ahead but it may be enough to show the EU there is a majority if they can move a little further.”
814403543	9	She added that it could allow the Government to “return for a third go at the meaningful vote, with a proven recipe for a majority” at a later date — despite there being less than three months until the UK formally leaves the EU.

814403543	11	Chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has said that Brexiteers have not gone soft over the Christmas break and still remain resistant to supporting the agreement, saying that more than 100 Tory MPs alone are expected to rebel and vote it down.
814403543	12	“During the recess I read reports that I could be open to supporting the Withdrawal Agreement and that I was even ‘a work in progress.’ It was at this time that it was reported that MPs when outside the Westminster bubble could be persuaded to back the deal.
814403543	13	“This never seemed likely and in my own case was wishful thinking, the backstop on its own is an intolerable failure of the negotiations,” Mr Rees-Mogg wrote in the Sunday Express.

814403543	15	Mrs May has doubled down on the scare tactics to push MPs into backing her Withdrawal Agreement, writing in the Mail on Sunday that critics of her deal were risking democracy and the economy.
814403543	16	“The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table,” she wrote adding that both Remain MPs pushing for a second referendum and Brexiteers wanting to honour the referendum result by making a clean break from the EU without a long transition tied to the bloc’s rules “must realise the risks they are running with our democracy and the livelihoods of our constituents.”
814403543	17	Meanwhile, a march organised by the pro-Remain People’s Vote, which calls for a second referendum, was revealed by The Telegraph to have only had a third of the attendees it claimed to while a petition calling for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March 29th, 2019, has gained more than 300,000 signatures.
814403783	1	MPs Threaten Government Shutdown to Stop No Deal Brexit
814403783	3	A group of Remainer MPs will attempt to stop a no deal Brexit by starving the Treasury of funds which could lead to “total paralysis” of the Government.
814403783	4	The MPs are set to vote on two amendments to the Finance Bill, which grants funds to the Treasury to spend on implementing no deal arrangements, on Tuesday.
814403783	5	Labour’s Yvette Cooper MP, who leads the group that includes former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin, and Nick Boles, said, “Our amendment would block some of the Treasury’s no-deal powers unless parliament has explicitly voted for no deal or unless the government has requested an extension of article 50.”
814403783	6	“We’ll be looking to table similar safeguards to all government legislation,” Ms Cooper added, with the Sunday Times reporting that the plans also have the backing of select committee leaders Hillary Benn, Rachel Reeves, Harriet Harman — all from the Labour Party –Frank Field (formerly of Labour), and Sarah Wollaston (Conservative).
814403783	7	Two members of Prime Minster Theresa May’s team told The Times on Saturday that the plan could lead to the “total paralysis” of Government.
814403783	8	A senior Government source added that Ms Cooper’s amendments would be “the first of many” attempts to stop a no deal Brexit should MPs vote down Mrs May’s unpopular EU Withdrawal Agreement in the week beginning January 15th.
814403783	9	There was no mention of a "deal" on the ballot paper.
814403783	10	The British public were given the binary choice of Leave or Remain.
814403783	11	Fantastic point from @PeterBoneUK on #Ridge this morning!#LeaveMeansLeave pic.twitter.com/yt5kEL7Mw9 — Leave Means Leave (@LeaveMnsLeave) January 6, 2019
814403783	12	May’s withdrawal agreement has found opposition from Brexiteers resulting in the prime minister postponing the House of Commons vote before Christmas in face of certain defeat — mainly over the issue of the Irish backstop which could see Northern Ireland locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc after the transition period, should London and Brussels not strike a deal, in order to stop a so-called ‘hard border’ with EU member state Republic of Ireland.
814403783	13	While the establishment media has taken to referring to the plot as a “Trump-style” government shutdown, the comparison misses a fundamental point: President Donald Trump’s shutdown is intended to push the American government to fulfil the will of the American people by securing the U.S.’s southern border, while Cooper’s team seeks to shut down the British government to frustrate the will of the people.
814403783	14	Both the Labour and Conservative parties’ 2017 General Election manifestos ran on pledges to respect the referendum vote and leave the EU; while Mrs May has been pushing MPs to accept her Withdrawal Agreement, a ‘no deal’ Brexit — the default legal position if the lower house votes down May’s agreement — is fulfilling the referendum result as Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.
814403783	15	“The only way you’re going to get on and deliver Brexit is what’s called a ‘no deal’ Brexit.
814403783	16	And then at the end of March we’ll be out of the EU and we will have left.
814403783	17	“There was no question, that I remember, on the referendum about a ‘deal’ or not; it was ‘leave’ or ‘remain.’ And the way you leave is to come out on the 29th of March.”
814403875	1	Brexit vote will ‘definitely’ happen, UK’s May says, as new poll shows most Britons would now vote to remain
814403875	3	British Prime Minister Theresa May said a vote on her Brexit deal will "definitely" happen next week, even as a new poll shows a majority of Britons would vote to remain in the European Union if there was a second referendum.
814403875	4	"We're going to be in uncharted territory if this deal does not go through," May warned in an interview with the BBC.
814403875	5	The British leader said that since the vote was pulled at the last minute in December, she's been consulting with EU leaders and British colleagues to get new assurances in three key areas, the details of which will be laid out in the coming days.
814403875	6	Those three areas include specific measures for Northern Ireland, a greater role for parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future U.K.-EU relations, and further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish backstop.

814403875	8	"When MPs come to look at this vote, they need to ask themselves: Does this deal deliver on the referendum?
814403875	9	Yes, it does.
814403875	10	Does it protect our jobs and security?
814403875	11	Yes, it does.
814403875	12	Does it provide certainty for businesses and citizens for the future?
814403875	13	Yes, it does," May explained.
814403875	14	Under forceful questioning from the BBC, May said that there should not be a second referendum.
814403875	15	A new YouGov survey showed that if a second referendum were held now, 54 percent of British citizens would be in favor of remaining in the European Union.
814403875	16	The poll, which was commissioned by People's Vote, an organization pushing for a new referendum, also found 41 percent thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote rather than leaving it in lawmakers' hands.
814403875	17	A deal setting out the terms of the United Kingdom's divorce from the EU has been agreed to between the prime minister and the EU, but it must pass a vote in Britain's Parliament before it is formally adopted.
814403875	18	Lawmakers are expected to vote on it either January 14 or 15.
814403875	19	The U.K. is due to leave the EU on March 29.
814403875	20	"Don't' let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good," May said.
814403875	21	"I want to see this deal go through."
814404002	1	Delingpole: Another Kamikaze Plot by MPs to Destroy Brexit with ‘Trump-Style’ Shutdown
814404002	3	‘An all-party group of senior MPs’ are plotting to sabotage Brexit by ‘starving the [British] government of cash and creating a Donald Trump-style shutdown’.
814404002	4	Do any of these gimps appreciate what a terrible look this is for representative democracy?
814404002	5	According to the Sunday Times, this group includes “former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper”, along with former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Wetwin and Nick Boles.
814404002	6	The idea is to vote on “two amendments to the Finance Bill that would lead to a gridlock in Whitehall unless Theresa May wins approval from parliament for a deal with Brussels.”
814404002	7	No, I have no idea either whether this plan is likely to succeed.
814404002	8	It could be just another of those “sounds big, means zilch” scoops that political editors come up with on a Sunday when there’s not much real news out there.
814404002	9	Or, for all I know, it could be the beginning of end of Brexit.
814404002	10	But either way, the standout point remains: parliament – the body of MPs whose ostensible purpose is to represent the interests of the British people – has gone AWOL.
814404002	11	Not just AWOL, actually, but completely barmy.
814404002	12	In order to advance its narrow, short-term aim of keeping Britain more or less within the European Union, parliament has decided to sever once and for all its relationship of trust with the electorate.
814404002	13	If these loser MPs weren’t so blinkered by their Remainer obsessions, they’d realise that the consequences for this will be far more serious and damaging than anything that might by caused by a “No Deal” – aka ‘hard’, aka ‘real’, aka ‘full English’ – Brexit.
814404002	14	Has there ever been a time in British history when parliament was so out of tune with the will of the people?Has there ever been a greater democratic deficit than when 17.4 million people voted for Brexit only to watch their parliamentary representatives so flagrantly, unapologetically and contemptuously seek to overrule them?
814404002	15	This isn’t just poor judgement.
814404002	16	It’s insanity.
814404002	17	Allister Heath made the case well before Christmas in a piece for the Telegraph titled ‘Hardline Remainers are becoming ever more extreme as time is running out.’
814404002	18	He likened the frantic desperation of Remainers to that of kamikaze pilots:
814404002	19	The intensity of their attacks is well beyond anything the Brexiteers can muster, which is why it feels like the pro-Remain counter-revolutionaries are winning.
814404002	20	To such true believers, nothing is taboo anymore, almost everything – careers, power, the Tory government, the capitalist order, even – is worth giving up to stop us from leaving the EU, especially without a formal deal.They have worked themselves up into such a frenzy that, shamefully, some would now prefer a neo-communist government to any meaningful Brexit.
814404002	21	There is a name for such preposterous loss of proportionality: it’s called Brexit Derangement Syndrome…
814404002	22	One of the many reasons the Remainers lost the Referendum was that they were quite unable to make a positive case for Britain remaining shackled to the crumbling, anti-democratic, arrogant, elitist, corrupt, sclerotic, mendacious, socialistic EU empire.
814404002	23	That’s what Projects Fear 1.0 and 2.0 were about: “Never mind the facts – here is some scary stuff we just made up to frighten you.”
814404002	24	Our only hope, I think, is to hold our nerve and never forget that whatever gibberish comes out of the mouths of our MPs – even ones we once thought we could rely on, like Brexiteer-turned-Mayite-sell-out Michael Gove – is just the delusional ramblings of a cowardly, self-serving, career-safe, unprincipled, spineless governing elite long, long past its sell-by date.
814404002	25	A poll last week by YouGov found that 57 per cent of Conservative Party members would prefer a no deal Brexit, whereas just 23 per cent would opt for Theresa May’s Brexit in name only “deal”.
814404002	26	Across Britain, outside the Remainer metropolitan strongholds, the people are still resolutely pro-Brexit.
814404002	27	You’d scarcely guess this from the mainstream media, even from those publications which originally came out for Brexit but which now are either rejecting it – eg the Daily Mail – or supporting it in name only – eg the Sunday Times.
814404002	28	We need to differentiate the signal from the noise.
814404002	29	The noise is all remain.
814404002	30	The signal is that Brexit – full, unapologetic Brexit – is still what most of us want.
814404002	31	Whether we’re going to get it, no one can predict.
814404002	32	But let’s not take at face value anything the pro-Remain Establishment – both MPs and media – tells us in the guise of dispassionate expertise.
814404002	33	They’re a bunch of shifty, cheating liars who are trying to sell their country down the river.
814404002	34	And one day, I hope, they will be made to pay for their treachery.
814427361	1	British PM warns of 'uncharted territory' if Brexit deal rejected
814427361	3	British Prime Minister Theresa May has reiterated that a delayed parliamentary vote on her widely maligned Brexit deal will go ahead later this month and warned the UK would enter "uncharted territory" should it be rejected by MPs.IIn an interview with the BBC on Sunday, May pledged to set out new measures to address the contentious Northern Irish "backstop" clause in her withdrawal plans in a bid to win over sceptical legislators.She also promised a greater role for the British Parliament in negotiations over future trade relations with the European Union.."If the deal is not voted on at this vote that's coming up then we are going to be in uncharted territory and I don't think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in parliament," May told the BBC.
814427361	4	Parliamentary opposition
814427361	5	The UK is poised to leave the EU on March 29, two years after it triggered Article 50, the exit clause in the EU's constitution, and kick-started arduous negotiations with European leaders over a divorce deal.
814427361	6	Last month, May pulled a vote on the brokered withdrawal agreement, settled on in November after more than a year of back-and-forth negotiations between London and Brussels, acknowledging it would have been roundly rejected by the UK's lower chamber House of Commons.
814427361	7	She later announced the vote would go forward in the week beginning January 14.
814427361	8	181214120018250
814427361	9	But parliamentary opposition to her deal remains fierce, with the main sticking point being the safety net "backstop" measure - which would guarantee no hard border is erected on the island of Ireland in the event that post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the bloc prove unsuccessful.
814427361	10	Critics of the backstop, which proposes that the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU "unless and until" the bloc agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border, argue it could tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely.
814427361	11	In an effort to assuage MPs concerns, May has lobbied her European counterparts and officials in Brussels to make concessions on the clause.
814427361	12	The EU, for its part, has insisted that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated but has made clear the backstop is meant only as a temporary measure of last resort.
814427361	13	DUP digs its heels in
814427361	14	The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which May's ruling Conservative Party relies on to command a majority in parliament, has urged the British leader to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its "poison" backstop provision on Ireland's post-Brexit border, however.
814427361	15	"The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the Withdrawal Agreement so toxic," DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement on Sunday.
814427361	16	"The coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff," he added.
814427361	17	The main opposition Labour Party has also pledged to vote down May's deal in parliament and threatened to initiate a no-confidence vote in her leadership should MPs refuse to back her plan.
814427361	18	181208084355355
814427361	19	Analysts said May's comments to the BBC did little to conceal the fact the British leader has no "gamechanger" amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement capable of swinging the parliamentary arithmetic in her favour.
814427361	20	"We are pretty much where we were before Christmas, with the proviso that there's less time left.
814427361	21	I don't see how the deal passes at the moment ... the interesting thing will be how much it loses by at the first attempt," Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London, told Al Jazeera.
814427361	22	"There are some MPs who are looking for an excuse to back the deal and so, something tokenistic and declaratory from the EU on the backstop clause would work for them, but I don't understand how that would work for the DUP, and that's where the action is," he added.
814427361	23	"Peeling off five of 10 Conservative Party MPs is neither here nor there, but if you get the DUP in line, May will give lots of parliamentarians an excuse to say, 'Well, OK, if they're happy with it I can't really justify going around moaning about the Irish backstop.'"
814427361	24	No-deal departure fears
814427361	25	Amid the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Britain's high-drama Brexit process, fears that the country could exit the 28-member EU bloc without a deal on the terms of its departure have continued to escalate.
814427361	26	181218142414510
814427361	27	The UK's central bank has warned that Britain's gross domestic product could shrink by up to eight percent in such a scenario.
814427361	28	The government, for its part, has forecast a potential economic slump of more than nine percent in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.
814427361	29	In a letter published by UK newspaper the Mail on Sunday, May warned critics of her departure plan risk damaging Britain's democracy and weakening its economy by opposing her deal.
814427361	30	She also alleged her deal was the only one that respects the UK's 2016 referendum result, in which 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU.
814427361	31	Growing calls for referendum rerun
814427361	32	But a new survey published by polling firm YouGov on Sunday suggested more Britons now want to remain a member of the bloc than leave it, however.
814427361	33	181201182945771
814427361	34	According to the research, which was commissioned by pro-second referendum campaign group the People's Vote, 46 percent of voters would opt to remain while 39 percent would vote to leave in the event of a rerun of the 2016 ballot.
814427361	35	When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favour of remaining.
814427361	36	The survey of more than 25,000 voters also showed that 41 percent of Britons thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote versus 36 percent who believe it should be up to parliament.
814427361	37	Removing those who are undecided, the split was 53 percent in favour of another referendum and 47 percent against.
814427361	38	Menon, however, argued the prospect of a second referendum being held remained slim.
814427361	39	"It's very hard to achieve - there isn't a majority in parliament for it … [and] it would require a significant extension of Article 50," Menon said.
814427361	40	"It's also impossible to say whether public opinion is in favour of a second referendum or not because answers to that question have varied basically as a function of the question that's being asked," he added.
814427361	41	"The polls split very clearly depending on the question you ask."

814435435	1	EXPOSED: Anti-Brexit March One Third the Size Organisers Claimed
814435435	3	The anti-Brexit People’s Vote march was just one-third of the size organisers claimed, it has been revealed.
814435435	4	The group, which pushes for a second referendum, claimed that 700,000 people marched on London on October 20th, 2018, but Scotland Yard confirmed to The Telegraph that the estimate is closer to 250,000.
814435435	5	“The Greater London Authority (GLA) has included an estimated attendance figure of 250,000 in a debrief document,” Scotland Yard said in a statement to the conservative newspaper following a Freedom of Information request.
814435435	6	“Please note this is not a Metropolitan Police Service estimate as we have not recorded an estimated attendance figure for the march,” the police force added.
814435435	7	The People’s Vote, launched in April 2018 by Remainer MPs Chuka Umunna (Labour), Anna Soubry (Conservative), and Caroline Lucas (Green), is supported by many of the key players in the Tony Blair-backed Remain continuity campaign Open Britain and pushed for a “public vote” on the final Brexit deal — i.e., a second referendum.
814435435	8	Labour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the march and hailed it a “historic moment in our democracy,” oversees the GLA.
814435435	9	The People’s Vote claims its wildly inaccurate estimations were “based on intelligence from both volunteers and professional stewards.”

814435435	11	Leave Means Leave co-chairman Richard Tice said of the revelation, “As we knew at the time, People’s Vote lied about its march size, [and it] appears [the] GLA covered up the truth.

814435435	14	Former UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage said, “People’s Vote lied about the number of supporters at their rally in London.
814435435	15	Hardly surprising, the pro-EU lobby have been lying to us for over 50 years.”
814435435	16	Meanwhile, a petition pushing for the UK to leave the EU in a clean break has reached more than 300,000 signatures.
814435435	17	MPs are set to return to Parliament next week to debate Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with a vote slated for the week beginning January 14th.
814435435	18	Dubbed “the worst deal in history” by Mr Farage, should it be voted down the legal default is a no-deal Brexit where the UK would leave on March 29th without a deal.
814435435	19	The UK would then trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms — the same as she trades with the rest of the world — and can immediately begin signing new, ambitious bilateral trade agreements with countries like the United States without having to be locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc during a near-two year transition period.
814630609	1	Government Sparking ‘Apocalyptic Fears’ over Clean Break from EU
814630609	3	Leading Brexit campaigners have said that the Government is sparking “apocalyptic fears” over the prospect of MPs voting against the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement and the UK making a clean break from the EU.
814630609	4	Writing in a paper published Monday entitled ’30 Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms’, Conservative peer Peter Lilley of Global Britain and Councillor Brendan Chilton of Labour Leave said that to break the House of Commons deadlock over the Irish backstop in Theresa May’s deal the United Kingdom should push for a Canada-style free trade deal.
814630609	5	However, if the EU is unwilling to renegotiate such terms, the Government should leave without a formal agreement — “No Deal” — and revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which Britain is already a member.
814630609	6	Lord Lilley and Cllr Chilton point out that leaving on “WTO+++” terms would mean not only saving £39 billion from the divorce bill envisaged in Mrs May’s deal, but also end the “corrosive economic and political uncertainty” of the two-year transition period, resolve the Irish border issue “by administrative measures without need for a backstop – as all parties have promised in the event of ‘no deal'”, and continue to trade with the EU on zero-tariff rates for up to a decade whilst negotiating a “Canada+++” trade agreement, as permitted under WTO Article 24.
814630609	7	REPORT: May Could Postpone Final Brexit Agreement Commons Vote Again https://t.co/WqOys2SpFn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 6, 2019
814630609	8	The Brexiteers debunked scare stories perpetuated by Remain politicians and establishment media by explaining that in the event of a WTO exit Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC )and the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs MRC (DEFRA) will not need to carry checks on all goods at the border, but only on goods if there is a perceived risk — with HMRC saying it will “prioritise flow over compliance” to prevent long queues at ports.
814630609	9	“Remain campaigners talk of chaos, catastrophe and Armageddon,” the authors wrote, and compared the “apocalyptic fears about leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement” to the hysteria which surrounded the Millenium Bug.
814630609	10	Economist Roger Bootle also wrote in The Telegraph on Sunday that the scare stories surrounding the Brexit debate echo those of europhiles who pushed for Britain to join the Eurozone 30 years ago, when then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, big business, and the mainstream media forecast economic disaster.
814630609	11	“Does this ring a bell?” Mr Bootle wrote.
814630609	12	“It should – an alarm bell.
814630609	13	Now we stand on the brink of another momentous decision.

814630609	15	Mr Chilton and Lord Lilley also criticised broadcasters for “cast[ing] aside their Ofcom obligations to balance and impartiality” by using loaded, anti-Brexit phrases to describe a WTO exit without a Withdrawal Agreement as “falling off a cliff-edge” or “crashing out”.
814630609	16	“In addition, this time the Government is clearly determined to play up the supposed horrors of leaving with no Withdrawal Agreement in the hope of persuading MPs to vote for the EU’s unloved draft ‘deal’.
814630609	17	“The government is in the bizarre position of preparing to leave on WTO terms, while pretending that its preparations will be unsuccessful,” they added.
814630609	18	Members of Parliament are returning to the House of Commons this week to begin debating Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with one Cabinet source saying “no-one at the moment thinks she will win the vote.”

814777937	1	The Far Right Is Trying to Co-opt the Yellow Vests
814777937	3	This weekend in Manchester, England, Yellow Vest protesters decorated their vests with logos of the far-right English Defense League.
814777937	4	In Edmonton, Canada, the Yellow Vest protesters were joined by members of the anti-Muslim group Wolves of Odin.
814777937	5	The Yellow Vest movement, which began as a nebulous economic protest in France, has found a new life with far-right groups abroad.
814777937	6	In Canada, the movement has spawned regular protests with a strong anti-immigrant message.
814777937	7	In the U.K., pro-Brexit factions have worn yellow vests to harass their rivals.
814777937	8	Participants in the Canadian and British demonstrations have also mixed the French movement with an unhinged American conspiracy theory.
814777937	9	The result is an international movement riddled with extremists, all feeding off the more popular French protests.
814777937	10	The original French Yellow Vest (“Gilets Jaunes”) demonstrations were not without their own far-right element.
814777937	11	Some of the movement’s earliest marches saw reports of racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, the New Republic reported.
814777937	12	A notorious anti-Semite was photographed as the face of the protests before journalists later recognized him.
814777937	13	A December poll found the movement had the highest favorability ratings with supporters of the far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
814777937	14	But the movement had a broader appeal.
814777937	15	The protests kicked off in November, sparked by a bundle of populist issues, including a new fuel tax and rising income inequality.
814777937	16	Liberal, leftist, and anarchist elements joined the protests.
814777937	17	A popular meme about the protests illustrated the movement’s allure to the political right and left, and to authoritarians and anarchists, alike.
814777937	18	This omnidirectional anger at French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist policies earned the Yellow Vest movement favorable polling in France—and admiration abroad.
814777937	19	Footage of the protests became popular on far-right and conspiracy Facebook pages in the U.S., where Americans highlighted some protesters’ anti-immigrant sentiments and promoted a hoax about Parisians chanting “we want Trump.” (President Donald Trump later repeated the false claim on Twitter.)
814777937	20	Pro-Yellow Vest memes are popular on Reddit’s biggest Trump page, r/the_donald.
814777937	21	In the U.K. and Canada, in particular, those far-right elements have taken their Yellow Vest admiration offline and onto the streets.
814777937	22	In London and Manchester this weekend, far-right Yellow Vesters rallied in favor of Brexit.
814777937	23	Some of the 40 attendees at the Manchester rally wore vests decorated with slogans by the English Defense League, a far-right Islamophobic group.
814777937	24	“If they want a war we’ll give them a war, let’s give them a fucking war,” one far-right Yellow Vest organizer shouted during a livestream of the London demonstration.
814777937	25	Last month, that same organizer was among a group of Yellow Vest demonstrators who accosted an anti-Brexit politician, calling her a “traitor.” Neo-Nazis previously used term to describe Jo Cox, an anti-Brexit politician who was murdered ahead of the 2016 Brexit vote.
814777937	26	“ U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	27	”
814777937	28	Meanwhile, the far-right group Wolves of Odin have been a persistent presence at Canadian Yellow Vest demonstrations every weekend, the Star Edmonton reported.
814777937	29	Some Canadian Yellow Vesters have denounced the Wolves of Odin, and leftist groups have used the Yellow Vest movement to push their own agendas in Canada and the U.K.
814777937	30	But the protests’ far-right elements remain highly visible.
814777937	31	Evan Balgord, director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network told the Star that the largest Facebook page for Canada’s Yellow Vest movement (which boasts more than 100,000 members) is rife with racism.
814777937	32	“If you go through it at any given moment, you’re going to find anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, you’re going to find death threats, you’re going to find other calls to violence, racism directed to Muslims—and it doesn’t take very long,” Balgord told the Star.
814777937	33	“I found my first death threat in five minutes.”
814777937	34	A brief scroll of the page on Monday afternoon surfaced anti-Muslim and anti-gay posts, as well as conspiracy theories about the New World Order.
814777937	35	U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	36	The organizer of this weekend’s London Yellow Vest demonstration wore a vest with a QAnon slogan on it, the BBC’s Mike Wendling reported.
814777937	37	QAnon is an American conspiracy theory that falsely claims Trump’s rivals are involved in bizarre crimes, namely child sex-trafficking and cannibalism.
814777937	38	Despite the theory’s obvious falsehoods, failed predictions, and origins in the U.S., it has attracted international fans who believe QAnon’s claims about global crime rings and imminent mass arrests.
814777937	39	The theory has a growing Canadian fanbase, The Daily Beast previously reported, and Canadian Yellow Vest protesters have carried QAnon signs since at least mid-December.
814777937	40	Although QAnon is led by an anonymous forum user who claims to be a Trump insider, its followers have increasingly expanded on the conspiracy theory, making it difficult for even its original author to control.
814777937	41	“I really feel like we're heading for a Q movement where Q isn't necessary,” Mike Rothschild, a writer documenting QAnon’s evolution remarked on Twitter this weekend.
814777937	42	That leaderless conspiracy movement could end up looking a lot like elements of the U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest movements: nebulous in structure, but undeniably far-right.
814777937	43	A Friday picture of a Canadian Yellow Vest protester showed the movement’s possible future.
814777937	44	Far from the economic populist platform of France, the demonstrator’s vest was decorated with a jumble of Trumpian and conspiratorial language.
814777937	45	“Q,” the vest read.
814777937	46	“No Trudeau.
814777937	47	CBC = Fake News.”

815412286	3	A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security “in foreign hands.”
815412286	4	The letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May’s controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as “our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA” and urges MPs to vote against the deal.
815412286	5	BRITISH PM THERESA SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
815412286	6	The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens,” the letter says.
815412286	7	“The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.”
815412286	8	The deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May’s Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged.
815412286	9	The so-called “backstop” to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U.
815412286	10	permanently.
815412286	11	Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U.
815412286	12	“a veto over our ability to exit.”
815412286	13	Dearlove and Guthrie say that the deal “threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships.” According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is “the exact opposition of the people’s instruction to take back control” when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.
815412286	14	In response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs “is completely wrong.”
815412286	15	SPAIN AGREES TO BACK BREXIT DEAL AFTER SECURING CONCESSIONS FROM BRITAIN, EU
815412286	16	The letter is the latest blow to May’s push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.
815412286	17	She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.
815412286	18	Should she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament.
815412286	19	That could, in turn, lead to a general election.
815412286	20	Those who have opposed Brexit have renewed calls for either a second referendum or a delay in Britain’s departure.
815412286	21	May did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the “whole world” wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.

815412286	23	May told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:
815412286	24	"The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U.
815412286	25	has made clear is the only deal,” she said, before calling it a “good” deal.
815858385	1	British ‘Yellow Vest’ Who Called Pro-EU MP a Nazi Is Arrested by Police
815858385	3	James Goddard, the self-styled British Yellow Vest who caused outcry when he branded Remainer MP Anna Soubry a “Nazi”, has been arrested.
815858385	4	Goddard, whose actions were described as “a type of fascism” by the Speaker of the House of Commons, had challenged the MP for the Leave-supporting constituency of Broxtowe near the Palace of Westminster with a group of supporters, asking why she was working to stop Brexit despite claiming to support its delivery ahead of the 2017 snap election, and branding her a “Nazi”.
815858385	5	The consequences were swift for the protestor — described as “far right” by most media outlets — with his Facebook and PayPal pages both being taken down within hours of the incident going viral.
815858385	6	Video footage of the arrest now appears to show Goddard being put in the back of a police van by an extremely large number of police officers.
815858385	7	The Met has confirmed “that a man in his 30s was arrested at 11.42hrs on Saturday, 12 January outside St James Park Tube station on suspicion of a public order offence” committed on January 7th — although they declined to name Goddard explicitly.

815858385	10	Goddard has defended his characterisation of Ms Soubry, saying the Tory MP had “shown [herself] willing to fight in favour of vested corporate interests, against the will of the people, and she is now trying to shut down legitimate free speech because it is inconvenient for her… those showing fascist, totalitarian, globalist tendencies should and will be compared to their greatest 20th-century counterparts: the National Socialist Party of Germany.”
815858385	11	Some observers who are not even especially sympathetic to Goddard and his boisterous group have raised concerns about the furious reaction to their protest.
815858385	12	Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, for example, remarked on the apparent contrast between the swift retribution when people targeted an EU loyalist politician with the many years where Brexit campaigners like himself were branded Nazis and “racist scum” without punishment or any particular sympathy from the mainstream media.
815858385	13	“MPs, public figures, should be free to go about and express their opinion without the threat of violence — but if we try now to put in place laws, or if the police start prosecuting people, for throwing terms of abuse, that reaction, I think, would be over the top,” he warned.

816460196	1	Theresa May faces catastrophic defeat in major Brexit vote as allies warn: ‘Winter is Coming’
816460196	3	Prime Minister Theresa May was facing a significant and potentially catastrophic defeat on a major Brexit vote in Parliament Tuesday, a defeat that could eventually lead to anything from no Brexit at all to a general election -- as May's allies took a page from “Game of Thrones” and ominously warned: “Winter is Coming.”

816460196	5	leaders, ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.It is a vote that May is expected to lose heavily, but the severity of the loss is likely to determine the extent to which May is able to go back to Brussels and demand further concessions to try again to get the agreement through Parliament..BRITISH MP DELAYS GIVING BIRTH BY TWO DAYS TO VOTE AGAINST BREXIT DEAL
816460196	6	May has been criticized by both sides of the debate for her handling of the implementation of the 2016 referendum, with Remain supporters accusing her of presiding over chaos, with pro-Brexit factions in her own Conservative Party claiming that she has kowtowed to Brussels and that her deal does not actually lead to Brexit being delivered.
816460196	7	“I’ll be voting against the withdrawal agreement because I don’t believe it delivers Brexit,” Conservative MP and top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on the BBC Tuesday.
816460196	8	The anger from the “Brexiteer” wing focuses primarily on the inclusion of a “backstop” -- a safety net that keeps Britain in a customs union with the E.U.
816460196	9	in case no trade deal is made after March.
816460196	10	It is intended to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but Brexiteers have pointed to the lack of a unilateral exit mechanism as evidence that the backstop will lead to Britain never actually leaving.
816460196	11	If May's agreement loses by more than 100 votes, it would likely renew calls from her own party for her to step down, and give impetus to the opposition Labour Party to put forward a motion of no-confidence -- a move that could eventually lead to a General Election.
816460196	12	A Sky News analysis Tuesday suggested she could lose by as many as 226 votes -- which would be the largest defeat in House of Commons history, and catastrophic for May.
816460196	13	EX-MI6 CHIEF SAYS THERESA MAY'S BREXIT DEAL 'THREATENS NATIONAL SECURITY,' HURTS US RELATIONSHIP
816460196	14	Others who support Britain remaining in the E.U.
816460196	15	have floated the idea of a second referendum, by which Brits would get a do-over on the 2016 referendum -- something May has rejected outright.
816460196	16	That proposal has been condemned by many Brexit supporters as an effort to scrub out the 2016 referendum, what they say is a trend in Europe by which voters are made to vote again and again until they vote the "right" way.
816460196	17	In the face of withering criticism, May and her allies have been pushing back, hoping to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum.
816460196	18	May told a packed House of Commons ahead of the vote that "I believe we have have a duty to deliver on the choices of the British people."
816460196	19	She also criticized Labour Party calls for a general election.
816460196	20	"At the end of a general election, the choices facing us will not have changed," she said.
816460196	21	Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who is a May supporter and also campaigned for Brexit in 2016, sought to rally Brexiteers to May’s side, using a "Game of Thrones" reference to warn that the damage would be significant.
816460196	22	“I think if we don't vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, 'winter is coming,’” he said on BBC's Radio 4, “I think if we don’t for vote the deal tonight, I think we will do damage to our democracy, by saying to people that we are not going to implement Brexit,” he said.
816460196	23	In the Commons on Tuesday, the bombastic Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave a thundering hour-long speech, in which he boomed a defense of the withdrawal agreement and sought to counter arguments against it: “It is what the people voted for and we by adopting this withdrawal agreement, can give it to them.”
816460196	24	Warning about the dangers to Brexit and to the country of voting down May’s deal, Cox asked: “Do we opt for order or do we choose chaos?'
816460196	25	MAY SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
816460196	26	To his own party, particularly the Brexit wing, he turned to the Tory benches and asked: “What are you playing at?
816460196	27	What are you doing?”
816460196	28	A defeat also makes it unclear of the future for not only May, but also Brexit.
816460196	29	Should the agreement fail, Britain is set to leave without a deal with the E.U., something that Remainers and some business groups have said would lead to chaos from an economic downturn to a lack of access to vital medicines as Britain’s ports clog up.
816460196	30	MAY SLAMS TONY BLAIR'S NEW BREXIT VOTE CALL
816460196	31	Those on the right of the Tory Party have downplayed the risks of no deal, noting that Britain would revert to normal World Trade Organization terms and the benefits of leaving the E.U.
816460196	32	would outweigh any difficulties.
816460196	33	“Cutting the costs of imports from outside the E.U., making our economy more competitive, is going to be extremely beneficial,” Jacob Rees Mogg told the BBC.
816460196	34	“All the gloomsters, the prophets of doom, are the people who prophesied doom before and they’ve been wrong in all their earlier forecasts.”
816460196	35	May's supporters have argued that her way is the only way to avoid no-deal.
816460196	36	In the face of one Labour MP who blasted Attorney General Cox for failing to acknowledge the dangers of “no deal,” Cox shot back: “She can rule out no-deal today, all she has to do is vote for this one.” He then accused the Labour Party of seeking to “drive this government onto the rocks, create the maximum chaos” and pave the way for an election.

816460196	38	May told Parliament that the only way to avoid no deal was the vote for hers, and emphasized the importance of the decision in Britain's history.
816460196	39	"The time has now come for all of us to make a decision, a decision that will define our country for decades to come, a decision that will determine the future for our constituents, for their children and grandchildren, a decision each of us will have to justify and live with for many years to come," she said.
816720060	1	Brexit: Goodbye United Kingdom, hello dis-United Kingdom
816720060	3	To grasp the real meaning of Brexit is to understand the history of a state born in mercantilism and sustained by centuries of empire and colonialism.
816720060	4	Chaos everywhere, consensus nowhere has and continues to define Britain’s stalling and tortuous attempt to depart the EU in an orderly fashion.
816720060	5	Such chaos should come as no surprise, however, because more than a harbinger of Britain’s departure from the EU, Brexit is a harbinger of the break-up of the UK.
816720060	6	Let me explain.
816720060	7	The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to give the UK its Sunday name, is the epitome of an artificial state.
816720060	8	It was and remains the product of the grafting together of divergent cultures, histories and national identities.
816720060	9	At inception, this grafting together was undertaken not in the interests of its peoples but in the interests of national elites eager to take advantage of the commercial opportunities of a unified polity with added manpower and resources in an age of empire.
816720060	10	The venality, greed and corruption of the Scottish ruling class in the late 17th- early 18th century delivered the Scottish people into the arms of the union with England without their support, establishing thereby the Kingdom of Great Britain.
816720060	11	This was reflected in the social unrest and riots that ensued in Scottish towns and cities both during the negotiations that brought into being the 1707 Act of Union, and upon its passage.
816720060	12	Read more
816720060	13	For the ruling elites of both Scotland and England the union of both parliaments into one had demonstrable commercial and strategic benefits.
816720060	14	The former had been left bankrupt after Scotland’s failed attempt at establishing its own overseas colony in Darien, Central America (modern day Panama) in the late 17th century.
816720060	15	In order to forestall national immiseration the need to gain access to England’s overseas colonies was thereafter considered essential.
816720060	16	Meanwhile the English were eager to prevent the possibility of Scotland being used as a staging ground for an invasion from the north by the French in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14).
816720060	17	Wales, the third nation that makes up the UK, had already been merged with England in 1536.
816720060	18	Ireland on the other hand was a subjugated English (latterly British) colony, and was officially brought into the orbit of what would then be known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.
816720060	19	In 1922, after a prolonged national liberation struggle in Ireland, the 26 counties that make up today’s Republic of Ireland achieved dominion status before winning full independence in 1948, while the remaining six counties that make up the entire island, or Ireland, were partitioned to become what is now Northern Ireland: hence the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of today.
816720060	20	This necessary historical detour out of the way, here is where things start to bear relevance to Brexit.
816720060	21	An unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution that saw Britain (UK) go on to forge an empire which at its height covered a quarter of the globe, was the forging of a unified working class whose unity transcended national, cultural and regional differences.
816720060	22	This class unity was the product of the country’s heavy industries – coal mining, steel, shipbuilding, etc.– and was expressed in common economic interests and struggles against a common enemy, the bosses and owners of those industries, in the context of the trade union movement..
816720060	23	It also began to manifest politically with the formation of the Labour Party at the start of the 20th century.
816720060	24	In tandem, forged over time, was a British national identity nourished by the countless wars the state’s ruling elite unleashed and waged over the centuries of an empire that existed not to spread civilization and modernity to the ‘dark peoples’ of the planet, as officially claimed, but as a juggernaut of exploitation, subjugation and oppression.
816720060	25	In those countless colonial wars working class men were used as cannon fodder in a dynamic that continues to the present day.
816720060	26	Read more
816720060	27	Margaret Thatcher destroyed this material basis of working class unity across the UK in the 1980s.
816720060	28	Her free market counter-revolution and resulting deindustrialization of the nation’s economy turned Britain into what it is today – a service economy underpinned by financialized capital.
816720060	29	The country’s trade union movement, which once wielded considerable economic and political clout, is but a shadow of its former self as a consequence, while the Labour Party was gutted of its founding principles by Tony Blair and his execrable centrist crew in the 1990s and on into the first decade of the noughties.
816720060	30	It is the remnants of this Blairite crew within the Labour Party who have and continue to be engaged in a concerted effort to undermine the party’s current socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn.
816720060	31	Such people, working alongside a reactionary Tory establishment, should be careful what they wish for.
816720060	32	Because in 2019 it is only Corbyn’s socialist program, offering economic and social transformation, that provides any hope of repairing the regional, national and cultural fault lines that correspond to the breakdown of the 2016 EU referendum vote.
816720060	33	The post-industrial north and midlands of England, parts of the country virtually untouched by investment and left without hope after being decimated by Thatcher, voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in a veritable scream from the bowels of austerity Britain.
816720060	34	Every one of Scotland’s 32 local authorities, meanwhile, voted Remain.
816720060	35	Wales, particularly post-industrial south Wales, voted for Brexit, while a five percent majority in Northern Ireland voted Remain.
816720060	36	It confirms that what was once the United Kingdom is now the dis-United Kingdom, with those previously mentioned national and regional differences informing its peoples’ identities and worldview over the identity of class to an extent previously unseen.
816720060	37	Brexit in this context is a sideshow, a pantomime largely being played out in parliament and the centrist mainstream.
816720060	38	As Karl Marx put it: “To call upon people to give up their illusions about their condition, is to call upon them to give a condition that requires illusions.”
816720060	39	The illusion that Brexit is actually relevant to the needs of those who’ve seen their lives devoured by the beast of neoliberalism and bludgeoned by austerity must soon give way to the unvarnished truth that the UK as we know it, is past its sell-by date
816720060	41	“A reactionary,” the great postwar Labour figure Nye Bevan once said, “is a man walking backwards with his face to the future.” Surveying a political class presently engaged in ripping itself apart over Brexit, who could argue otherwise?

817147979	4	Good Omen For Trump?
817147979	5	| Articles
817147979	7	The parallels between British and American politics are simply eerie.
817147979	8	In 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit—and guess what?
817147979	9	Since then, of course, the political classes in both countries have been conspiring to reverse the election results.
817147979	10	But Theresa May just suffered the greatest defeat of any British Prime Minister when her BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by the House of Commons 432-202.
817147979	11	Subsequently, May has survived a vote of No Confidence and the outlook is confused.
817147979	12	But clearly the Deep State has not yet tamed British populism.
817147979	13	A good omen for Trump?
817147979	14	May’s defeat was terrible enough, but it was even worse because the “payroll vote,” of Members of Parliament (= Congressmen) holding government office, is around 140.
817147979	15	Hence, BRINO only attracted around 60 backbenchers (who within reason can vote as they like).
817147979	16	The Spectator has a list, with names, of the 118 Tories to voted against May’s deal.
817147979	17	This gives May and her government a tremendous problem because ever since she came back with the draft deal she has been saying it is her way or the highway, stubbornly insisting that no other deal is available.
817147979	18	But such was the deal’s subordination of UK interests that many commentators argued would leave the UK as a vassal state.
817147979	19	[May’s Brexit deal: the legal verdict | The PM’s plan isn’t bad – it’s atrocious, by Martin Howe QC, Spectator, November 24, 2018]
817147979	20	This fiasco is largely due to having a Remainer PM (May opposed Brexit although she wasn’t brave about it) and a Remainer-dominated cabinet.
817147979	21	At best their heart isn’t in Brexit; at worst they are deliberately trying to sabotage it.
817147979	22	Similarly, many Trump Administration officials and GOP Congressional leaders have been all too obviously hostile to his agenda.
817147979	23	With a Leaver PM and a Leaver-dominated Cabinet, there would still have been a potential problem with Remainer-dominated Houses of Commons and Lords.
817147979	24	But it is doubtful that Remainers in Parliament would have been so blatant in their attempts to frustrate a straightforward Brexit.
817147979	25	The defeat of May’s deal is encouraging for Brexiteers inasmuch as the overwhelming result should have greatly lessened any thoughts May had of coming back with a few insignificant cosmetic changes.
817147979	26	However, it’s still a possibility.
817147979	27	And there are many other threats to thwart a true Brexit.
817147979	28	If there is a serious breakdown of party discipline, there is nothing to stop Remainer MPs doing anything they want because the House of Commons still has a substantial majority of Remainers.
817147979	29	But a bright spot for Brexiteers: the date for the UK’s leaving is fixed in an Act of Parliament.
817147979	30	Section 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal ) Act 2018 states ‘“exit day” means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m.’
817147979	31	To change the date of the UK leaving the EU requires either an amendment to or a repeal of the Act.
817147979	32	And unless the Brexit leaving date is changed, it does not matter what else happens, because there is a legal obligation on the UK to leave.
817147979	33	A second referendum cannot be held, an extension of Article 50 cannot be sought by the UK or granted by the EU and Article 50 cannot be revoked.
817147979	34	In addition Remainers, however aided and abetted by the unethical Remainer Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, cannot ultimately stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March.
817147979	35	There are serious obstacles to the House of Commons voting to amend or repeal the leaving date.
817147979	36	To begin with it would nakedly expose the Remainers’ anti-democratic partisanship.
817147979	37	Ever since the referendum, most Remainers have consistently bleated that they honored the result, although obviously hoping to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	38	Having their true feelings exposed will be more than embarrassing, because there are many constituencies (= Congressional districts), especially ones held by Labour MPs, that voted heavily to leave the EU while their MP voted Remain.
817147979	39	Leave voters might well punish Remainer MPs in Leave constituencies.
817147979	40	Then there is the entirely practical alternative option of a No-Deal Brexit—more precisely, leaving without any negotiated deal with the European Union and proceeding to trade under World Trade Organization rules.
817147979	41	Significant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready-made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.
817147979	42	Of course, WTO membership does not mean that future bilateral trade deals cannot be struck.
817147979	43	So what is really happening—in the U.K. and the U.S.?
817147979	44	The Deep State is often portrayed as a conspiracy.
817147979	45	In fact, it is better thought of as a blind sociological event.
817147979	46	There is no group of conscious conspirators, simply people being groomed to have the same opinions or at least saying they do.
817147979	47	What has happened in the UK (and the rest for the West to varying degrees) is the success of the long march through the institutions.
817147979	48	That is what ultimately has given the UK an elite (politicians, mediafolk, teachers etc) who are overwhelmingly Politically Correct internationalists.
817147979	49	And it’s those people who are at the forefront of the attempts to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	50	How did it come about?
817147979	51	A German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.
817147979	52	Eventually there would be enough of such people to change the policies of Western societies from national to internationalist ones.
817147979	53	That point was reached in the UK at least 50 years ago and the Politically Correct stranglehold on our society is now complete.
817147979	54	The capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has “anti-racism” (in reality anti-white racism) at its heart.
817147979	55	The last brick in the Politically Correct building is the increasingly draconian treatment of anyone who refuses to toe the line—increasingly including the use of the criminal law and imprisonment.
817147979	56	That is why Western politics until recently has been so ideologically monotone.
817147979	57	Brexit was a revolt against that mentality.
817147979	58	Most MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.
817147979	59	But by doing so, MPs forfeited their right to do anything other than honour the result of the referendum.
817147979	60	That applies just as much to Remainer MPs as Leaver MPs.
817147979	61	Sadly, the behaviour of the most committed Remainers with power and influence (including many MPs and peers in the House of Lords) has shattered utterly the idea that the UK is a fully functioning democracy.
817147979	62	Rather, it is an elective oligarchy whereby the electorate are offered an opportunity every few years to choose between competing parts of the elite—an elite in the UK whose general political ideas are largely held in common and go against the interests and wishes of most of the electorate.
817147979	63	None of this should be a surprise.
817147979	64	The sad truth: the central political question in all Western societies is—how far will the masses be able to control the naturally-abusive tendencies of the elite?

817176202	1	The British People, as Well as the Politicians, Don’t Want Brexit
817176202	3	The British Parliament just handed Prime Minister Theresa May one of the biggest legislative defeats in parliamentary history, by rejecting her Brexit plan.
817176202	4	These House of Commons politicians may simply be following the will of the British people, who now reject the idea of leaving the European Union only a few years after narrowly approving the plan in a referendum.
817176202	5	May should either call for a new referendum, or resign, if she cares about British democracy.
817176202	6	Europe Cut Off?
817176202	7	The British people have always had some ambivalence about joining the European Union.
817176202	8	It’s more about being independent than being anti-European.
817176202	9	This was best illustrated by a story my political science professor told me years ago.
817176202	10	After a violent storm in the English Channel, telecommunications between the island and the mainland were severed.
817176202	11	The headlines in Europe read “Terrible Storm: England Cut Off.” The United Kingdom newspapers touted the headlines, “Terrible Storm: Europe Cut Off.”
817176202	12	Polls going back to February of 2012 confirm this.
817176202	13	Opposition to the EU in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was much stronger, with 45 percent wanting to leave the EU and only 35 percent wanting to remain, with 20 percent unsure and the remainder saying they would not vote.
817176202	14	Opponents of the EU largely led the polling landscape from 2012 to 2015.
817176202	15	Subscribe to Observer’s Politics Newsletter
817176202	16	From 2015 to 2016, there was a seesaw battle between proponents of Brexit and opponents, who wanted to stay in the EU.
817176202	17	It seemed to change from survey to survey.
817176202	18	The supporters of leaving the EU narrowly won out, largely due to wild claims from Brexit supporters, like the UK Independence Party (UKIP), that the country would make a lot of money by leaving the EU.
817176202	19	In addition, support for Brexit was also fueled by opposition to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a free market champion and EU supporter who became pretty unpopular quickly due to a series of scandals, and his policies that struggled to help the UK recover from the Great Recession.
817176202	20	I went into a Conservative Party club in 2012 in Oxford and could barely find a Cameron supporter in his own party’s get-together.
817176202	21	I found just a tiny photo of him that had been moved to the back of the building.
817176202	22	Support for the EU Rises
817176202	23	But something happened after the Brexit vote.
817176202	24	Polls show that the number of undecided votes dropped precipitously, and support for the EU rose.
817176202	25	As people realized that voting for Brexit wasn’t like winning the lottery, and that the country was due to face a lot of economic pain for breaking with the European Union, support for Brexit slipped in the polls.
817176202	26	Additional polls consistently show that those favoring the EU would win a new referendum, as people realize the consequences of Brexit, as well as the false promises such a plan won’t deliver.
817176202	27	May, who assumed power after Cameron resigned, sought to capitalize on the Brexit vote by calling for early elections.
817176202	28	Instead, this Brexit cheerleader was humiliated at the polls, and her party lost its majority in power, relying on a Northern Ireland party to cling to power.
817176202	29	May sought to negotiate the Brexit plan with the EU.
817176202	30	But the plan was so unpopular in 2018 that she tabled it, hoping the House of Commons would like it better in 2019.
817176202	31	They liked it less, leading to May’s Waterloo in the vote.
817176202	32	Not since Tory Prime Minister Lord North received the news from Yorktown about the success of the American Revolution has a British politician been so humiliated.
817176202	33	Time for Another Vote
817176202	34	Failing to learn the lessons of her defeat, May refused to call for a new referendum, calling such a move “antidemocratic.” But what’s more antidemocratic: giving the people a new vote and a second chance, or leaving her tiny parliamentary coalition in charge of making the policy.
817176202	35	When it comes to democracy, to paraphrase from the film The Princess Bride, I would say “You keep using that word.
817176202	36	I do not think that words means what you think it means.”
817176202	37	Former Labor PM Tony Blair, and former Conservative PM John Major, have called for a new vote, showing a rare moment of bipartisanship.
817176202	38	Polls estimate that at least 55 percent of the British people want to stay.
817176202	39	It’s time to have a fake news-free referendum that doesn’t involve racism or the stabbing death of a parliamentarian who opposed Brexit.
817176202	40	Let the British determine their own fate before the end of March, and let’s not leave it up to a lame duck prime minister who doesn’t seem to command a quarter of the House of Commons.

817190270	3	A Briton Rejoices At BREXIT's Triumph | Articles
817190270	5	When I woke up on that warm 24th of June, at six o’clock, other than my regular neck ache, I felt something, a sense of disappointment.
817190270	6	I knew Leave had lost the referendum.
817190270	7	The exit polls had said that leave would lose.
817190270	8	The bookies had said we would lose.
817190270	9	My natural-born pessimism had seeped in.
817190270	10	Of course, I was in bed at this time.
817190270	11	I was left to my thoughts.
817190270	12	My own cynical thoughts.
817190270	13	I hadn’t actually bothered to look at the news.
817190270	14	That was until my sister came screeching in exclaiming, “We are leaving the EU!
817190270	15	You won!”
817190270	16	I had to make sure.
817190270	17	“It couldn’t be,” I thought.
817190270	18	“The people taking a stand?
817190270	19	No chance.
817190270	20	She must be pulling my leg.”
817190270	21	But lo and behold, it was true.
817190270	22	Utterly.
817190270	23	52% for Leave to a 48% for Remain.
817190270	24	I won’t lie, I did cry.
817190270	25	I’m not ashamed of it either.
817190270	26	I’m rarely made happy by the political discourse, but this was the rare exception.
817190270	27	I had actually had a sense of pride for the nation and the people who finally took a stand against its masters.
817190270	28	Lying there on my bed, since the power of this event had stunned me from getting up, I started to reflect on how far the movement to officially leave the EU had come to pass.
817190270	29	I recalled last year, at the start of the referendum campaign, right after the general election.
817190270	30	I was in a conference hall, partly funded by the EU, for a rally on our “Future Relationship with the European Union”.
817190270	31	It was a UKIP event.
817190270	32	I found the event powerful.
817190270	33	The smell of smoke filled the room.
817190270	34	Reporters were standing by.
817190270	35	It was full to the brim of people, young and old.
817190270	36	Nigel Farage, the man to thank for bringing us this referendum in the first place, gathered to do his speech.
817190270	37	Playing the song The Final Countdown by the band Europe, as he came down.
817190270	38	The crowd was in rambunctious cheers and applause as he talked.
817190270	39	They loved it.
817190270	40	As did I. I never considered myself a member of any movement until that day.
817190270	41	I loved the power it invoked in me.
817190270	42	I was with real people who truly believed in what they said.
817190270	43	They didn’t care about Political Correctness, they believed in doing what was right.
817190270	44	My mind fast-forwarded to one of the days where I leafleted in a city center.
817190270	45	In my gut, from the looks people gave me, the discussion with people on the busy street, even the diversity of the other leafleters, I felt that we were going to vote for Brexit.
817190270	46	Leave had the arguments and it had the people behind it.
817190270	47	Remain had University students prepping themselves for a degree in Politics.
817190270	48	I ignored my gut until the morning of the 24th and went with the bookies.
817190270	49	A wise choice for most instances.
817190270	50	But I was wrong, and I’m glad of it.
817190270	51	The white working class was truly key to this referendum, though, rejecting the usual, Center-Left consensus from their natural party, the extremely pro-European Labour party.
817190270	52	They picked the chance of controlling their own borders as they thought for the future of their own kin.
817190270	53	Only four of the constituencies in the poorest section of England, and Labour heartland, the North East, voted narrowly for a Remain vote, compared to the 11 constituencies that voted to leave.
817190270	54	Things were similar in the Labour heartland of Wales.
817190270	55	[EU referendum results and maps: Full breakdown and find out how your area voted, by Malcolm Coles and Ashley Kirk, Telegraph (UK) June 24, 2016]
817190270	56	The Left wasn’t the only one shook up by the rebellion.
817190270	57	Real Tories came out and defended their sovereignty in the south.
817190270	58	They rejected the “Great” deal made by Prime Minister David Cameron, who can now be seen to be a political failure—a deal that even Cameron’s own MPs had a hard time praising.
817190270	59	[EU deal: What David Cameron asked for... and what he actually got, by Peter Foster,Telegraph (UK), June 14, 2016 ] Though usually more loyal when it comes to Conservative policies, they decided they had had enough and voted with their hearts.
817190270	60	These people knew how the EU had harmed them.
817190270	61	They were not blind sheep who blindly follow their party’s whims.
817190270	62	They ignored the fear peddled by Obama, Cameron, Juncker, and every other “enlightened” expert.
817190270	63	They knew that none of those people lived or had even been to the areas affected by the EU.
817190270	64	The working class saw the EU applied, and they didn’t like it.
817190270	65	Nor did the real Tories in the south.
817190270	66	The economic arguments used by Remainers, meant and mean nothing if their own quality of life was being squandered because of cheap labor and living in perpetual fear from the dangerous effects of immigration.
817190270	67	When Britain joined what was then deceptively European Economic Community in 1973, Britain was still reeling over a lost empire.
817190270	68	We were stranded, and we stumbled onto what seemed like something we could latch onto.
817190270	69	However, that quickly changed.
817190270	70	The EEC became a unionist, empire-building political project.
817190270	71	Enoch Powell, famous for his “Rivers of Blood” speech on immigration, knew this.
817190270	72	He cost the Tory Party, which had he quit dramatically, the election by telling supporters to vote Labour in 1974, because it was offering a referendum on membership in the EEC.
817190270	73	Unfortunately, many didn’t see the upcoming globalist travesty that Enoch envisioned and in the 1975 referendum Britain gave a resounding “Yes” to the European Union (as it renamed itself, now frank about its political goal).
817190270	74	They never knew what they were truly getting into.
817190270	75	The small print was too tough to see.
817190270	76	The back door was closed on them.
817190270	77	But now that they have seen the EU’s aims, and actually feel the impact that the EU can have on the “serfs”, they gave Merkel the rightfully deserved two fingers (in America this would be one finger) to her, her bureaucrats, and her project.
817190270	78	This was a triumph for the nationalist movement and for nationalism in all countries—whether or not people who voted realize this.
817190270	79	This is bringing independence to the natural borders of nations.
817190270	80	You cannot merge different cultures and races in a top-down system centered around a utopian vision.
817190270	81	A nation can only truly look after its own.
817190270	82	Europe is not a nation, nor should it be treated as such.
817190270	83	After our historic vote, real nations, places like Holland, Denmark, and even France, are already asking for their national identity back from the globalists in Brussels and Germany in similar “Brexit” referendums.
817190270	84	This is not perfection, as I might seem to be portraying it.
817190270	85	Problems will be encountered.
817190270	86	We need a democratically-elected government that actually will control its own borders, instead of that we have currently.
817190270	87	Much of the damage is already done.
817190270	88	Instead of having a neoliberal economic policy, we need an economic policy that actually cares about Britain’s own industries.
817190270	89	In addition, we need a foreign policy, not made by NATO and the neocons of Washington DC.
817190270	90	The barrier of the EU would always prevent us from ever changing those matters.
817190270	91	Our own major parties would like keep this up also.
817190270	92	We can get rid of them though.
817190270	93	We could not get rid of Brussels.
817190270	94	Leaving the European Union is the right direction.
817190270	95	It is not the right destination for making Britain truly, great.
817190270	96	Nationalists should praise what has happened to the UK for what it is; a sign of the shifting tide of opinion that has been constantly ignored by elite opinion.
817190270	97	Hopefully Brexit will not be the last of the exodus.
817190270	98	The European Union has gone onto too long.
817190270	99	It is high time real nations broke free from its shackles.

817408115	20	We all know, by a process of elimination, what Tusk means by the "only positive solution."
817408115	21	That's Britain staying in the EU and sticking two fingers up at the 17.4m people, many of them from the most deprived parts of the country, who voted to Leave.
817408115	22	EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker meanwhile urged the UK to "clarify its intentions as soon as possible", warning that "time is almost up."
817408115	23	I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the @HouseofCommons this evening.
817408115	24	I urge the #UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible.
817408115	25	Time is almost up #Brexithttps://t.co/SMmps5kexn — Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) January 15, 2019
817408115	26	It's hard to escape the conclusion that the EU offered Britain such a bad deal because they knew it wouldn't be passed.
817408115	27	Then, maximum pressure could be exerted on theUK to reconsider its decision to leave, or at least kick Brexit into the long grasss, which is what having a second referendum would do.
817408115	28	Right on cue, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, and the front-runner to become Germany's next chancellor after Angela Merkel, has made an '11th hour' plea for Britain to stay in the EU.
817408115	29	The emotional plea, which lauds "the legendary British black humour" among other things, comes, appropriately enough, in a letter to the neocon propaganda organ the Times, which supported 'Remain.'
817408115	30	The European establishment is desperate for Britain to reconsider Brexit.
817408115	31	Internationalist ideals about 'preserving European unity', don't come in to it, this is all about protecting income streams.
817408115	32	Read more
817408115	33	Consider a few facts.
817408115	34	If Britain does leave without a deal, then the EU as an institution would be considerably worse offThe UK has consistently been one of the top three countries that puts most into the EU budget (after Germany and France).).
817408115	35	It is one of ten countries that puts more into the EU than it gets out.
817408115	36	In 2017, the UK's net contribution was £9bn.
817408115	37	If Britain leaves, the EU faces a financial shortfall.
817408115	38	In 2016, 16 countries were net receivers, including Donald Tusk's Poland.
817408115	39	Little wonder that he regards Britain staying as "the only positive solution".
817408115	40	The very generous financial remuneration packages of EU officials might also be threatened by British withdrawal.
817408115	41	n December, it was reported that the EU's top civil servants would be paid over €20,000 a month for the first time, and that Tusk and Juncker would see their packages rise to €32,700 a month.
817408115	42	Austerity?
817408115	43	Not in Brussels, mon ami!
817408115	44	The EU is a fabulous gravy train once you are on board.
817408115	45	But the gravy train relies on its richest members not leaving, otherwise who's going to foot the bill?
817408115	46	If Britain leaves with 'No Deal', it's not just the EU budget which will take a hit.
817408115	47	In 2017, EU countries sold around £67 billion more in goods and services to the UK, than the UK sold to them.
817408115	48	Europe needs full and unfettered access to British markets, much more than Britain needs full and unfettered access to European markets.
817408115	49	Read more
817408115	50	That's not being 'nationalistic', but simply stating the economic reality.
817408115	51	The country that would lose out the most with Brexit is Germany.
817408115	52	Britain's trade deficit with Germany is higher than with any other country, even higher than China, whose products are everywhere in our shops!
817408115	53	In 2016, the year of the EU referendum, Britain imported around £26 billion more from Germany than it exportedIt's no great surprise therefore to see the president of the Federation of German Industries as one of the signatories of the letter to the Times, pleading for Britain to stay!y!
817408115	54	Repeat after me: "We would miss Britain as part of the European Union.
817408115	55	We would miss Britain as part of the European Union"We also have to discuss fishing.
817408115	56	The other EU countries do extremely well out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides them with access to UK waters.
817408115	57	Belgian fleets get around half their catch from British waters!
817408115	58	As reported in the Independent, the Common Fisheries Quota has for the past 34 years given 84% of the cod in the English Channel to France and just 9% to the UK.
817408115	59	Overall, EU vessels take out around four times as much fish out of UK waters as British vessels take out of EU waters.s.
817408115	60	Again, you don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the EU doesn't want Britain to leave.
817408115	61	If the EU's commitment to democracy was genuine, they would have done everything they could to make sure the referendum result of June 2016 was implemented.
817408115	62	But the financial hit of Britain leaving is too high.
817408115	63	So, instead they have done everything possible to subvert the democratic will of the people, while at the same time boasting about their commitment to 'democracy.'
817408115	64	Good news for democracy: Parliament is proposing EUR 1.8 billion funding for a new Rights and Values MFF Programme.
817408115	65	Civil society will be our strongest ally to protect the #RuleOfLaw & fundamental rights across the EU!
817408115	66	https://t.co/7UQLP71GMK — Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) January 17, 2019
817408115	67	Of course, the EU is not the only party to blame.
817408115	68	The British government, led by a Remainer, and with Remainers holding prominent positions in the Cabinet, has been pusillanimous.
817408115	69	Theresa May has shown she is desperate for a 'deal' whereas in fact, the ones who really need an agreement to provide continued unfettered access to lucrative UK markets, are the EU.
817408115	70	If the UK government had called Brussels' bluff and announced that Britain would just leave, you can be sure Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and co would have come running with a much better offer.
817408115	71	Their (very high) salaries, and the profits of European businesses, depend on it.

817449755	1	Derbyshire Cheers For Hard Brexit | Blog Posts
817449755	3	The fuss about Brexit over in the U.K. is of only indirect interest to us Americans, but it does show another aspect of the slow political revolution taking place all over the Western world.
817449755	4	As our own correspondent Robert Henderson posted here at VDARE.com on Thursday, the Brexit vote of June 2016—the vote by British people to leave the European Union—was of a piece with the election of Donald Trump five months later.
817449755	5	Both events represented a revolt by ordinary citizens against entrenched Deep State elites and their media, corporate, and academic shills.
817449755	6	Two-plus years on, it's clear on both sides of the Atlantic that those entrenched elites were more entrenched than the revolutionaries supposed.
817449755	7	Both in the U.S.A. and Britain, they have put up a mighty resistance to the loss of their power and influence.
817449755	8	So which revolution is doing better, ours or theirs?
817449755	9	On the evidence of this week, I'd have to say Britain's is ahead.
817449755	10	British Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated a deal with the EU, a package of conditions under which Britain could finally leave the EU on March 29th.
817449755	11	It was a lousy deal for the Brits, keeping the nation chained to the EU bureaucracy in a hundred ways.
817449755	12	"BINO" I called it back in December—Brexit in Name Only.
817449755	13	Robert Henderson prefers BRINO, and I'm okay with that: the perception is the same.
817449755	14	Tuesday this week Britain's parliament finally got to vote on Mrs May's deal.
817449755	15	They voted it down.
817449755	16	That generated a mini-crisis as the opposition party in parliament called a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
817449755	17	That vote, however, went Mrs May's way, so she remains in power.
817449755	18	But since parliament's rejected her deal, what are the terms under which Britain will leave the EU on March 29th?
817449755	19	A strong possibility now is: no terms.
817449755	20	This is the so-called "hard Brexit."
817449755	21	Britain just walks out, leaving the bureaucrats and businessmen to sort things out among themselves as best they can.
817449755	22	There would be chaos and confusion; but, as Adam Smith said, there's a deal of ruin in a nation.
817449755	23	The Brits have faced far worse within living memory.
817449755	24	When the dust settled they'd have their sovereignty back, and could set their own laws in their own parliament for their own people again.
817449755	25	That would be worth a bit of chaos.
817449755	26	A great many Brits agree.
817449755	27	Here's a sound clip from last week.
817449755	28	It's from a weekly show on BBC-TV called Question Time, in which a panel of pundits and politicians takes questions from a studio audience.
817449755	29	This being the BBC the panels are slanted left-liberal, making it usually a pretty dull show.
817449755	30	This Thursday's Question Time panel, however, included political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.
817449755	31	Following those earlier events of the week, the question of course came up: Is there now any alternative to a "hard Brexit"?
817449755	32	Ms Oakeshott took the question.
817449755	33	Here's what she said:
817449755	34	Oakeshott: Well, the answer … look, I can save everybody a lot of time here …
817449755	36	Emcee: Oh, do!
817449755	37	Because it's been two years, so, so, …
817449755	39	Oakeshott: The short answer is: No, there isn't.
817449755	40	And that is why it seems to me the only option for Theresa May now—and I'm going to admit that it is a sub-optimal position—is to walk away.
817449755	41	That is all she can do.
817449755	43	Emcee: So to leave with no deal.
817449755	45	Oakeshott: Yes, absolutely, because that isn't … (Drowned out by prolonged cheering and applause from the studio audience.)]
817449755	46	Just listen to that studio audience!
817449755	47	Hard Brexit?
817449755	48	They love it!
817449755	49	The TV coverage is even more telling.
817449755	50	They're happy, with the happiness of people who just heard an authority figure—Ms Oakeshott is the privately-educated offspring of an upper-class family—an authority figure taking their side against the elites.
817449755	51	I can't forbear adding that Question Time is a peripatetic show, set in a different city each week.
817449755	52	Thursday's show was set in Derby, which is of course the capital city of Derbyshire …
817449755	53	It's worth adding also that the Brits seem still to have some of their resourcefulness in the face of impending chaos.
817449755	54	The London Daily Mail, January 18th, reports a severe shortage of warehouse space in Britain on account of British firms stockpiling all kinds of goods, including food.
817449755	55	The firms fear that chaos over the absence of customs rules at ports of entry following a hard Brexit will slow down or stop entry of goods.
817449755	56	That's private action, not government action; but I'm reminded of Margaret Thatcher and the crisis with Britain's coal miners in the early 1980s.
817449755	57	When the miners' union leaders first started acting up, Thatcher appeased them with soft talk.
817449755	58	Meanwhile, behind the scenes, she called in her Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson and told him to start stockpiling coal.
817449755	59	When the stockpile was big enough, Thatcher turned on the miners and confronted them boldly, from a position of strength.
817449755	60	She was a smart lady, and that's smart government.
817449755	61	You listening, Mr President?
818141325	1	Prime Minister May's 'Brexit Plan B' looks a lot like 'Brexit Plan A'
818141325	3	British prime minister Theresa May unveiled her Brexit Plan "B" yesterday after Parliament decisively rejected her original plan to take Great Britain out of the European Union last week.
818141325	4	Associated Press:
818141325	5	Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party accused May of being in "deep denial" about her doomed deal.
818141325	6	"This really does feel a bit like 'Groundhog Day,'" he said, referring to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, in which a weatherman is fated to live out the same day over and over again.
818141325	7	Outlining what she plans to do after her EU divorce deal was rejected by Parliament last week, May said that she had heeded lawmakers' concerns over an insurance policy known as the "backstop" that is intended to guarantee there are no customs checks along the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.
818141325	8	May told the House of Commons that she would be "talking further this week to colleagues ... to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House.
818141325	9	"And I will then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU."
818141325	10	The bloc insists that it won't renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.
818141325	11	The problem with the Northern Ireland "backstop" is that May and the E.U.
818141325	12	kicked the can down the road for a permanent solution.
818141325	13	Plan "B" isn't much better:
818141325	14	The backstop proposes to keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU in order to avoid checks on the Irish border.
818141325	15	It is meant as a temporary measure that would last until a permanent solution is found.
818141325	16	But pro-Brexit U.K. lawmakers fear Britain could become trapped in it, indefinitely bound by EU trade rules.
818141325	17	Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz broke ranks with EU colleagues Monday by suggesting the problem could be solved by setting a five-year time limit on the backstop.
818141325	18	The idea got a cool reception.
818141325	19	Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that "putting a time-limit on an insurance mechanism, which is what the backstop is, effectively means that it's not a backstop at all."
818141325	20	The Labor Party is calling for a second referendum, which is political show and not a serious proposal – at least at this point.
818141325	21	A referendum couldn't be planned and executed by the March 29 deadline, and besides, there is no legal mechanism to withdraw Great Britain from Article 50 of the E.U.
818141325	22	charter – the legal basis they have invoked to withdraw from the E.U.
818141325	23	in the first place.
818141325	24	May is stuck and appears trapped between opposition E.U.
818141325	25	leaders, who are refusing to renegotiate the pact she agreed to in November, and members of her own party, who can't agree on how they should quit the E.U.
818141325	26	Looks as if May must go back to the drawing board.
820419869	1	No break from Brexit: RT takes a look at latest developments, as MPs told ‘no holiday for you’
820419869	3	As British MPs are told that their February break from parliament is to be cancelled in order to solve the chaos currently enveloping Britain, RT takes a look at the latest goings-on in the EU divorce saga.
820419869	4	On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.
820419869	5	Over two and a half years after that vote, the British people are no clearer as to how the country will leave the bloc it's been a member of since 1973.
820419869	6	So, where are we at with less than 60 days to go until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29?
820419869	7	Also on rt.com Brexit diagnosed in 10 common cognitive disorders
820419869	8	Theresa May and her government
820419869	9	The British prime minister won the backing of UK MPs in parliament on Tuesday after the ‘Brady’ amendment, backed by her government, was voted through, in what was seen as a major victory by many of her supporters.
820419869	10	The amendment instructed May to renegotiate her Brexit deal with the EU and secure the necessary changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
820419869	11	Without finding “alternative arrangements” that the EU will agree to, the PM will find it difficult to push through her deal at a second attempt in two weeks' time.
820419869	12	She's expected to travel to Brussels for talks in the next few days.
820419869	13	On Wednesday, Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that compromises would have to be made on the backstop by the EU otherwise it would lead to a no-deal – meaning the UK would not hand over any of the £39 billion divorce bill money.
820419869	14	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, indicated on Thursday that Brexit could be delayed to secure a deal with the EU and claimed proposals to solve the Irish border issue will be devised over the coming days.
820419869	15	The EU
820419869	16	The bloc has remained united in their stance regarding opening up the EU Withdrawal agreement.
820419869	17	A variety of EU officials and representatives from member states have stated that they will not renegotiate the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed in November 2018 and will not contemplate removing the Irish backstop as it would threaten Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement.A spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk, issued a firm statement on Tuesday evening in the aftermath of May receiving the backing of UK parliament to renegotiate her deal, saying that the “Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.””
820419869	18	Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, insisted on Wednesday that the backstop must remain.
820419869	19	His Brexit Steering Group stated “…the withdrawal agreement is fair and cannot be re-negotiated.”
820419869	20	The Republic of Ireland's Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday that his country would not accept wishful thinking as an alternative to the backstop.
820419869	21	Coveney insisted: “We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty…”
820419869	22	Hardline Brexiteers
820419869	23	The European Research Group (ERG), seen as the highly influential Brexiteer faction of the Tory Party, supported May's government on a variety of amendments on Tuesday evening, including the Brady Brexit proposal.
820419869	24	However, the harmony between these hardline Brexiteers and May's cabinet has not lasted very long.
820419869	25	Former Brexit minister Steve Baker accused the PM of making a “stupid mistake” by excluding the ERG's favored civil servant, Crawford Falconer, to carry out renegotiations with the EU.
820419869	26	Olly Robbins, who currently leads the UK's civil service on Brexit negotiations, is seen as too pro-EU for the ERG's liking.
820419869	27	People's vote
820419869	28	MPs and activists campaigning for a second referendum have taken a severe hit to the momentum they seemed to have built over the last few months.
820419869	29	Their chances of securing a people's vote have been significantly reduced after MPs decided to vote against Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment that would have seen Brexit delayed past March 29.
820419869	30	Without an extension of Article 50, there cannot be enough time put aside to secure the necessary legislation for a second referendum.
820419869	31	Labour
820419869	32	Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party suffered a setback on Tuesday during votes on Brexit amendments.
820419869	33	They lost on the Cooper and Brady amenmendents as well as their own proposal to give MPs options to back Labour's Brexit plans and a second referendum.
820419869	34	Some party activists have called for Labour MPs who voted with May's government on key amendments on Tuesday to be deselected.
820419869	35	Corbyn met May on Wednesday for discussions on Brexit, in a bid to find a cross-party consensus that can garner the support of a majority of MPs.
820419869	36	He described talks as “a useful exchange of views” and asked the PM to consider a permanent customs union with the EU to break the impasse.

820791520	1	George III Lost America.
820791520	3	Theresa May Could Lose the United Kingdom Over Brexit.
820791520	5	Britain is locked in the most serious peacetime crisis in its modern history, the increasingly desperate attempt to secure the nation’s orderly departure from the European Union.
820791520	6	Brexit has shown the world a British parliament and a political class that resembles a ship of fools without a captain.
820791520	7	One veteran of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet said that voters are looking at parliament “with something rather near to contempt.”
820791520	8	We speak of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the Western world.
820791520	9	Since 1721 it has seen 74 prime ministers of highly varied competence and backgrounds but few if any as incapable of steering the country through perilous times as the current incumbent, Theresa May, who could end up being compared to George III because of the consequences of her ineptitude.
820791520	10	The ultimate test of a prime minister in a crisis is always the same—how well do they measure up to the moment?
820791520	11	The answer to that depends on a combination of skills.
820791520	12	Quite often they are skills that politicians do not find in themselves until they are called upon by destiny to prove them.
820791520	13	Different times need different abilities.
820791520	14	Sometimes a prime minister who at the time seems mediocre is later reassessed and seen to have been more consequential than anyone realized because he was overshadowed by a predecessor.
820791520	15	In British history there is a classic instance of this: In 1945 Winston Churchill was rudely and unexpectedly removed from office in a general election and replaced by the leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee.
820791520	16	Churchill, the country’s greatest ever war leader, was contemptuous of his successor whom he described as “a modest little man with a lot to be modest about.”
820791520	17	It turned out that Attlee (who was deputy prime minister during the war) was precisely what the nation needed, not only to get through years of austerity imposed by the near-bankruptcy created by the war effort, but as the parliamentary leader with the skills to re-engineer British society and provide its people with a comprehensive safety net including, notably, free universal health care for life.
820791520	18	So here were two men equally indispensable in their abilities, one to lead and the other to heal.
820791520	19	In each case their mastery reflected their character, Churchill who was able to project himself as the living embodiment of a great national narrative of obdurate resistance and victory and Attlee as the quiet but systematic architect of change.
820791520	20	And today Britain has Theresa May.
820791520	21	It is too generous to say that May has had trouble measuring up the to moment.
820791520	22	She has trouble explaining what the moment actually is—the utterance that will forever be her epitaph in the history of political discourse will be “Brexit means Brexit.”
820791520	23	Imagine Churchill saying “war means war.” OK, let’s be reasonable.
820791520	24	When it comes to oratory nobody can hold a candle to Churchill.
820791520	25	Every prime minister since Churchill has carefully avoided getting into that kind of contest.
820791520	26	But when the qualities of leadership are under scrutiny it’s important to understand that Churchill was as courageously decisive in private as he was in public.
820791520	27	There is a passage in Andrew Roberts’ sweeping new biography, Churchill, Walking With Destiny, describing a moment where the prime minister speaks ad lib and without leaving his own record of what was, literally, one of the statements that saved Britain.
820791520	28	He was speaking to men not as resolved as himself who needed to believe in him as an army needs to believe in its generals.
820791520	29	It came in the early summer of 1940 when Churchill, who had taken over only a week before, was resisting attempts to negotiate with Hitler.
820791520	30	He told his new cabinet: 
820791520	31	“I have thought carefully in these last days whether it was part of my duty to consider entering into negotiations with That Man.
820791520	32	But it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out.
820791520	33	The Germans would demand our fleet—that would be called ‘disarmament’—our naval bases and much else.
820791520	34	We should become a slave state… If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.”
820791520	35	No official minute was taken of that statement—Roberts quotes it as recorded later in the diary of a cabinet member.
820791520	36	What is new now is that Theresa May brings to the office a background like no other before her.
820791520	37	She is the first person to hold that office who is by both experience and instincts a bureaucrat.
820791520	38	Her rise to the Tory party leadership owed much to her success as a bureaucrat.
820791520	39	She ran a government department that was so large and so challenging to master that some prime ministers were known to have deliberately given it to rivals in order to destroy their careers: the Home Office, a Whitehall edifice that could perhaps be compared to a nightmare package embracing the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Homeland Security.
820791520	40	She was put there by David Cameron, a prime minister who was himself notoriously bored by administrative details and, as his decision to hold a national referendum on Brexit demonstrated, not too smart at judging outcomes.
820791520	41	May survived with a mixed record at the Home Office.
820791520	42	She acquired something of the reputation of a control freak, devoted to organizational charts and preferring to run the department through a small and tight-knit clique of loyal aides and Tory Party law-and-order zealots.
820791520	43	Churchill, famous for asking for opinions “on one half sheet of notepaper,” said that a camel is what you end up with if you ask a committee to design a horse.
820791520	44	May was fond of setting up committees and official inquiries to avoid taking action and produced many camels.
820791520	45	One of her former cabinet ministers despaired that “it’s a fantastic skill, her ability to do nothing.”
820791520	46	“ Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
820791520	47	The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
820791520	48	”
820791520	49	Later she managed to swat away responsibility for an ugly debacle during her watch.
820791520	50	West Indians who immigrated to Britain in the 1950s were threatened with mass deportation because they had no record of legally arriving—then it turned out that the Home Office itself had discarded the documentation.On the face of it her bureaucratic cast of mind should have been an asset when facing the complexities involved in negotiating Britain out of all the political, legal and commercial attachments to the European Union.
820791520	51	After all, the country was not facing a lethal existential threat.
820791520	52	This was a self-initiated unraveling of laws and treaties.
820791520	53	But the EU is the world’s largest assembly of bureaucrats, a characteristic often damned by the pro-Brexit campaign, as well as by more reasoned critics.
820791520	54	A negotiation of this complexity had never been attempted by anyone before.
820791520	55	It needed a team that combined a complete command of administrative detail, a shrewd sense of the national interest, an equally shrewd assessment of the opposing interests, and an ability to understand the difference between bottom-line economic interests and the EU’s loftier moral values as an alliance committed to protecting constitutional democracy in a continent with an unhappy history of autocracies.
820791520	56	This was a tough deal for anyone to successfully achieve.
820791520	57	But any leader who was able not only to pull it off but to sell it to their people—in the case of the UK to a people divided by a referendum margin as close as 52 to 48 percent—needed to have something else.
820791520	58	They had to be able to bring eloquence and vision to their argument.
820791520	59	Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
820791520	60	The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
820791520	61	The closest she has ever come to articulating the case for the Brexit deal she negotiated that set up a 21-month transition period for achieving a new free trade agreement with the EU (the deal that she is again stuck with trying to amend and resuscitate despite that fact that the EU has warned it will not renegotiate) was to say, repetitively, “It is in the national interest for everyone to get behind it.”
820791520	62	Basically when the narrow majority of Brits voted for Brexit they voted for something that didn’t actually exist.
820791520	63	There was not even the vaguest outline of the real impact that Brexit would have on British life.
820791520	64	Its proponents, even if they had any sense of the outcome (which is doubtful) weren’t interested in pesky details.
820791520	65	They were appealing to raw emotions, largely anti-immigrant xenophobia, not advancing a rational argument.
820791520	66	The Brexit deal that May presented to parliament went down in the biggest defeat any prime minister has suffered, 432 votes to 202.
820791520	67	All along she had been trying to reconcile elements that are not reconcilable: keeping the support of her party’s lunatic fringe that is undismayed by the prospect of a “no deal” exit that would bring extreme self-harm while also holding the loyalty of the center of the party—and doing this while satisfying the terms the EU is prepared to allow.
820791520	68	(“Allow” is the realistic term because Britain has always been a supplicant.)At the same time she survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote that leaves her in power while seriously wounded and without a new deal that is likely to fly.
820791520	69	Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, is similarly ineffectual and unready to meet the leadership tests of his time.
820791520	70	His party includes a rump of Brexiters and his cabinet is in thrall to fossilized Marxist ideas.
820791520	71	His rhetorical skills are, if anything, less evident than May’s.
820791520	72	Given two clueless party leaders it often seems that all the politicians are overcome by the kind of helpless rapture that sent Thelma and Louise driving blissfully over the cliff.
820791520	73	In 1940 Churchill’s freedom of action was greatly helped by the fact that he did not have to bow to any party’s dictates.
820791520	74	He was appointed prime minister without being leader of the Tory party—the leader remained his predecessor as prime minister, Neville Chamberlain.
820791520	75	Uniquely, Churchill led a coalition of the Tory, Labour and Liberal parties at a time when none of those parties would probably have accepted him as their party leader.
820791520	76	As a result of this freedom he was able to isolate and negate the influence of the appeasers who did not like the prospect of choking in their own blood.
820791520	77	He could and did appeal directly to the spirit of a parliament and a people who set aside partisan interests in favor of a higher purpose, victory that was by no means assured.
820791520	78	The irony now is that Brexiters represent only 15 percent of the 650 members of the House of Commons.
820791520	79	A large majority is opposed to Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal.
820791520	80	A prime minister not constrained by party loyalties could easily get support for a “soft” Brexit—meaning a measured transition from full membership to one that keeps the country in a permanent customs union without disruption.
820791520	81	Instead, by trying vainly to satisfy everyone May is satisfying nobody except people like the loony Little Englanders who say that such a deal would leave Britain as a “slave state.”
820791520	82	If they get their way May could well go down in history as the prime minister who lost the kingdom—the United Kingdom.
820791520	83	Scotland wants nothing to do with Brexit and if it is imposed on them the Scottish parliament will probably vote to end the Acts of Union of 1707 that created the United Kingdom in order to leave them free to join the EU.
820791520	84	The implications are wider than that.
820791520	85	Leaders in the European Union—including Germany’s Angela Merkel—are now fretting that the EU without Britain will be less able to clamp down on the kind of populist taste for autocrats that is afflicting Poland and Hungary.
820791520	86	George III went down in history as the king who lost America.
820791520	87	Nobody in particular was held culpable for losing the empire—that was an inevitability of history that imposed its own logic and timing.
820791520	88	If the United Kingdom becomes Little England (albeit including Wales and Northern Ireland) it will have reverted to the boundaries of the land it was in 40 A.D. when the Romans made a coherent colony out of a rabble of warring tribes.
820791520	89	And this fiasco will be owned by a parliament that allowed a deranged minority to win and a prime minister who was never remotely equal to the greatest challenge of her time.

821040551	3	If Britain leaves the European Union without a trade deal, and riots ensue, Queen Elizabeth will be evacuated from London, according to reports.
821040551	4	Many British people are reportedly worried that there won’t be a deal when the U.K.leaves the EU in less than 55 days and, as a result, have been busy stockpiling medication and food.
821040551	5	A new report has also emerged that the 92-year-old monarch has a contingency plan, underscoring the severity of the situation, The New York Times reported.
821040551	6	The Sunday Times additionally reported that evacuation plans for the royal family had long been in place.
821040551	7	A Cabinet Office staffer, who was not identified in the report, told the newspaper: “These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War, but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit.” Buckingham Palace declined to address evacuation plans on Sunday, with a spokeswoman saying, “We’re not commenting on that at all.”

821744708	3	Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, lashed out at the UK, saying he wonders what the "special place in hell" will be like for those who pushed for Brexit without coming up with a clear plan to deliver it.
821744708	4	Addressing reporters in Brussels, Tusk reiterated the EU’s position on the Withdrawal Agreement, stating that the Brexit deal agreed with Theresa May’s Tory government in November last year, was not open to renegotiation.
821744708	5	May arrives for talks with EU officials on Thursday in an attempt to formulate “alternative arrangements” on the contentious Irish backstop.
821744708	6	Tusk declared that he hoped the UK PM would come to the negotiating table with some realistic suggestions on the backstop.
821744708	7	On the prospect of a ‘no-deal’ scenario, Tusk insisted that Brussels is preparing for such a “fiasco,” before delivering some harsh words for UK government officials.
821744708	8	“I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to deliver it safely,” he said.

821744708	10	The EU Council president, flanked by Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar during his statement, claimed that people across Europe were hoping the UK would reverse its decision to leave the European Union.
821744708	11	He accepted that the prospect of the UK remaining in the EU was slim, given that both May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were “pro-Brexit.” He added: “Today, there is no political force, and no effective leadership, for remain.”
821744708	12	Tusk reaffirmed the bloc’s commitment to the Irish backstop, insisting that the EU “will not gamble with peace.”
821744708	13	A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May has responded to Tusk’s comments, stating that it was a question for him as to “...whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful.”
821744708	14	The Democratic Unionist Party’s Brexit spokesperson, Sammy Wilson MP, has unleashed a damning appraisal of Tusk following his Brussels statement, labeling him a “devilish, trident-wielding euro-maniac.”

822220578	3	Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Houses of Parliament in London on January 29, 2019.

822220578	5	London (CNSNews.com) – At the online Labour Party shop, you can still buy a spiffy T-shirt emblazoned with the picture of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, looking sober and determined.You can also purchase a Corbyn tote bag, mug, framed print – and the official Jeremy Corbyn pint glass, which can hold a liberal amount of beer.
822220578	6	However, these wares might not be flying off the virtual shelf so quickly these days, as a handful of polls indicate that Britain’s main opposition party is suffering as a result of its ambivalent stance towards a second vote on leaving the European Union.
822220578	7	The 69-year-old Corbyn, a veteran lawmaker on the party’s far left who beat the odds to become its leader in 2015, has long been popular among younger voters, who helped propel him to near victory in the 2017 general election.
822220578	8	Since then, he has refused to fully back calls for a second Brexit referendum, calling it merely one of the “other options” available, in case Britain’s planned withdrawal from the E.U.
822220578	10	next month goes badly.CCorbyn wrote a public letter to Prime Minister Theresa May this week, outlining what kind of agreement Labour would support with the E.U.
822220578	11	post-withdrawal.It included a customs union and a generally close relationship with the E.U., but was silent on the question of second referendum.
822220578	12	In a recent survey by Opinium, 22 percent of young Labour voter respondents indicated they could move away from the party on the grounds it hasn’t done enough to stop the planned exit.
822220578	13	A YouGov poll in December found similarly that support for Labour among 18 to 29-year-olds would drop from 60 to 33 percent if the party supported Brexit in any form.
822220578	14	British media outlets this week published parts of a leaked private report drawn up for a Labour-allied trade union, which reportedly described failure to oppose Brexit as more damaging to the party than its support for the Iraq war in 2003.
822220578	15	Meanwhile student leaders have warned that Labour is in danger of losing “millions” of voters.
822220578	16	A front-page advertisement in Corbyn’s local newspaper in London featured a call from more than 100 activists for a public vote.
822220578	17	Chris Stafford, an expert in British politics at the University of Nottingham, said this week Corbyn’s strategy has been to stay in the background while May’s Conservative Party – which has pro- and anti-E.U.
822220578	18	wings – has torn itself apart over Brexit.
822220578	19	But after waiting and biding his time, Stafford said, Corbyn is now under pressure to make his position clear.
822220578	20	“It is hard to criticize the government and say you would do it better while not offering a concrete alternative,” he said.
822220578	22	There has been public talk of a group of lawmakers breaking away from Labour, although Stafford said he doubted a new party would attract that many voters.“When it comes to election day most people stick with one of the bigger parties because they don’t want to ‘waste’ their vote on a different [smaller] one,” he said.
822220578	23	Stafford said while polls suggest Labour is losing support, Corbyn could regain popularity if he takes a stance that makes his party distinct from the Conservatives.
822220578	24	May has pledged not to run again for prime minister.
822220578	25	Stafford said that, while much will depend on who the Tories choose as their next leader, the complete disarray within the Conservative Party will help Corbyn look like a better option.
822220578	26	Call for U.S.-style primaries
822220578	27	This week, a prominent Labour activist called for American-style primaries to be introduced when it came to selecting candidates for parliament.
822220578	28	Aaron Bastani, a writer with links to Corbyn, tweeted that if people thought newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) embodied excellent politics it was important to remember she got into office through a primary.
822220578	29	“We need the best leaders in parliament,” he tweeted.
822220578	30	“Primaries, along with mandatory reselection, is how.”
822220578	31	Currently, candidates in both the Labour and Conservative parties are selected through local party organizations, often with input from the party’s national office.
822220578	32	In 2009, in what was billed as a first, a physician named Sarah Wollaston was selected as a Conservative Party candidate through an open primary held through the mail.
822220578	33	She won, and now sits in the House of Commons representing Totnes in southwest England.
822220578	34	Wollaston said Thursday that the experiment allowed local voters to choose from a wide range of candidates, both experienced politicians and newcomers.
822220578	35	Non party members were allowed to participate as well, in a constituency that has a solid tradition of electing Conservatives.
822220578	36	“In a so called safe seat, open primaries give voters the chance to select a candidate who, if subsequently elected, would at least be nearer their own political views,” she said.
822220578	37	“But the postal method is expensive and I think this has made it difficult to sustain.”
822295249	1	Norway’s govt proposes legislation to secure rights of citizens in case of no-deal Brexit
822295249	3	Norway proposed legislation on Friday to secure the rights of Norwegians living in Britain and of Britons living in Norway in case of a no-deal Brexit, the Justice Ministry in Oslo said.
822295249	4	While Britain and EU-outsider Norway agreed last year to apply the principles of a Brexit agreement in their bilateral relationship, the new legislation would also cover a no-deal scenario.
822295249	5	“We hope Britain will have an orderly exit from the EU.
822295249	6	We must however be prepared for Britain choosing to leave the EU without a deal,” said Justice Minister Tor Mikkel Wara.
822295249	7	If approved, the legislation would delegate power from the non-EU nation’s parliament to the government, allowing it to protect citizens’ rights, Reuters said.
822942601	1	Britain’s Gavin Williamson places Russia & China on notice, I'm not joking
822942601	3	UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is itching for conflict with Russia and China.
822942601	4	He’s not mad.
822942601	5	Not even slightly.
822942601	6	But he is stupid.
822942601	7	Very.
822942601	8	Unlike former fireplace salesman Gavin Williamson, I am no military expert.
822942601	9	But then you do not need to be one to understand that while Britain going to war with Russia and China might work as a video game, the real thing would be an exceedingly bad idea.
822942601	10	So why then in a speech delivered to the Royal United Services Institute in London, did Mr Williamson’s argument on the feasibility of the real thing elicit applause rather than the shrieks of horror and demands he be sacked forthwith it should have?
822942601	11	This is a serious question, by the way.
822942601	12	It is one that cuts through British establishment verbiage to reveal a country ruled not by the sober and doughty political heavyweights of years gone by, but by foaming fanatics in expensive suits.
822942601	13	Also on rt.com We must be ready to use ‘hard power’ against Moscow and Beijing – UK defense chief
822942601	14	Placing to one side for a moment the insanity of the very concept of Britain deploying hard power against Russia and/or China, the prospect of fighting a war against two designated enemies at the same time is a recipe for disaster.
822942601	15	Not satisfied with that, though, Mr Williamson is actually contemplating a conflict with three different enemies at the same time – i.e.
822942601	16	against Russia, China, and the millions of people in Britain his government is currently waging war against under the rubric of austerity.
822942601	17	“Today, Russia is resurgent," Mr Williamson said, “rebuilding its military arsenal and seeking to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union, like Georgia and Ukraine, back into its orbit.”
822942601	18	For Mr Williamson and his ilk a resurgent Russia is a bad thing.
822942601	19	Much better in their eyes if Russia, after the Soviet era in the 1990s, had remained on its knees as a free market desert; its state institutions in a state of near collapse and tens of millions of its citizens in the grip of immiseration.
822942601	20	Yes, because in that scenario Western ideologues like him would have had free rein to rampage around the world as they saw fit, setting fire to country after country on the perverse grounds of ‘saving them’ for democracy.
822942601	21	Read more
822942601	22	As it is, he and his still managed to squeeze in a considerable amount of carnage and chaos in the years it did take Russia to recover.
822942601	23	The indictment reads as follows: Yugoslavia destroyed; Afghanistan turned upside down; Iraq pushed into the abyss; Libya sent to hell.
822942601	24	By the time they turned their attention to Syria, intent on exploiting an Arab Spring that NATO in Libya transformed into an Arab Winter, Russia had recovered and was able to intervene.
822942601	25	It did so in concert with the Syrian Arab Army, Iran and Hezbollah to save the day – much to the evident chagrin of those who, like Gavin Williamson, prefer to see countries in ashes rather than independent of Western hegemony.
822942601	26	As to the facile nonsense about Russia trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit, both countries happen to share a border with Russia and both countries, in recent years, have been used by the UK and its allies as cat’s paws with the eastward expansion of NATO in mind.
822942601	27	It gets worse though: “The Alliance must develop its ability to handle the kind of provocations that Russia is throwing at us.
822942601	28	Such action from Russia must come at a cost.”
822942601	29	“Provocations,” the man said.
822942601	30	Since British troops have been taking part in exercises on Russia’s doorstep, not the other way round, one wonders if Gavin Williamson wrote this speech while inebriated.
822942601	31	It is Russia that has been on the receiving end of repeated provocations from NATO member states such as the UK in recent times, and it is Russia that has been forced to respond to protect its own security and that of its people where necessary.
822942601	32	Furthermore, not only in Russia but everywhere, including the UK, people understand that when you have political leaders intoxicated by their own national myths and propaganda to such an extent as Britain’s Defence Secretary, danger ensues.
822942601	33	Read more
822942601	34	The most enduring of those national myths where London is concerned is that the British Empire was a force for good rather than a vast criminal enterprise, that Britain and America won the Second World War together alone, that Iraq had WMDs, and that international law and international brigandage really are one and the same thing.
822942601	35	Perhaps the most preposterous section of the speech came when Mr Williamson tried to fashion a connection between Brexit and Britain’s military strength: “Brexit has brought us to a moment.
822942601	36	A great moment in our history.
822942601	37	A moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass.”
822942601	38	Reading this, you can almost hear Churchill turning in his grave.
822942601	39	Britain’s wartime prime minister had such as Gavin Williamson in mind when he famously said, “He has all the virtues I dislike, and none of the vices I admire.”
822942601	40	Mr Williamson obviously misread the memo talking up not the opportunity for increased conflict with China after Brexit but trade.
822942601	41	This was not a speech it was a linguistic car crash, one that will forever command an honoured place in compendiums of the worst political speeches ever made.
822942601	42	As for Gavin Williamson, just as no responsible parent would ever dream of putting an 10-year old behind the wheel of car to drive unsupervised, no responsible British government would ever appoint a man like him as its Defence Secretary.
822942601	43	In years past, he would have struggled to find employment polishing the brass plate outside the building.

824256050	1	Ireland and the Border
824256050	3	Ireland and the Border
824256050	4	Ireland has been a trouble spot since the invasion of the island by the English king Henry II in 1171, whether to prevent a rival, Strongbow, from controlling the area, or to overcome the damaging opprobrium resulting from the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 29, 1170, by four of his knights.
824256050	5	Declaring that Ireland was a part of his empire, Henry II changed the course of Irish history as resident Normans in the area pledged their loyalty to the British crown.
824256050	6	Almost a thousand years later, the borders of Ireland remain a difficult political problem, and indeed may have dominated the debate over the last few years over the issue of Brexit.
824256050	7	Economic and political relationship between the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, has been a central factor in the negotiation process of the UK and EU over Brexit.
824256050	8	Thus, the border issue is not simply bilateral, it is also an EU issue.
824256050	9	The problem is compounded by the fact that the Brexit issue evokes historical memories as well as having political as well as economic implications.
824256050	10	After Henry II, inhabitants lost territory to new arrivals from England, who formulated the laws.
824256050	11	The crucial problem arose with Henry VIII and his decision to leave the Catholic Church and have the country adopt Protestantism, to which many Irish were opposed in their desire to remain Protestant as well as speak their own language, Gaelic.
824256050	12	Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland to reestablish control over Ireland, massacring over 2,000 of the population in the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, while Ulster, a Protestant bastion, remained loyal to England, as it still is.
824256050	13	Cromwell remains a villain for many Irish.
824256050	14	More troubles ensued during following centuries.
824256050	15	During the great famine 1845-49, Ireland lost more than 1.5 million victims.
824256050	16	By 1900 the country had only half the number of inhabitants it had in 1830.
824256050	17	On January 1, 1801 the Act of Union united the two areas, previously linked by personal union, into a single kingdom, the United Kingdom.
824256050	18	The Chief Secretary, the key administrator in governing Ireland, ruled on behalf of London.
824256050	19	However, the struggle for Irish emancipation starting in the 19thcentury continued.
824256050	20	After the failed Easter Rising against British rule in April 1916, guerrilla war between the IRA and Britain occurred, 1919-1921.
824256050	21	It ended in May 1921 with the partitioning of the country, ending British rule in most of Ireland.
824256050	22	The Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion in December 1922 while Northern Ireland, NI, remained in the UK.
824256050	23	Finally, on April 18, 1949 the Republic of Ireland was established, an independent republic, headed by a president.
824256050	24	However, hostilities between the IRA and the government continued in Ulster, virtually 30 years of civil war, including the Bloody Sunday incident on January 30, 1972 when 28 unarmed civilians were killed by British troops during a protest March in Derry (Londonderry).
824256050	25	Hostilities lasted until April 10, 1998, Good Friday, which began the peace process.
824256050	26	Good Friday was concerned with creating an infrastructure of cooperation between north and south, between the Irish government and the newly created power sharing Irish Assembly, in Northern Ireland.
824256050	27	It also implied the normalization of relations between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and the ROI.
824256050	28	The normalization would mean the opening of the border which had previously been manned by British soldiers.
824256050	29	As a result, since both countries are still in the EU, there are no checks on goods or people moving between Northern Ireland and the ROI.
824256050	30	The open border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process as well as of economic cross-border cooperation.
824256050	31	All political sides in the Brexit negotiations agree there should not be a “hard” border, checks on persons, goods, or infrastructure, dividing NI from the ROI whatever the outcome of final negotiations.
824256050	32	Therefore, keeping the border open and abiding by the Good Friday Agreement is critical.
824256050	33	As a result, Brexit negotiators devised the so-called “backstop,” a political invention, a fallback position, to keep the border open as much as possible between the ROI and NI, even if no comprehensive trade deal can be reached between UK and EU.
824256050	34	NI is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another EU country, the ROI.
824256050	35	By backstop, the whole of UK, according to Prime Minister Theresa May, would enter in a single customs territory with EU, no tariffs on trade in goods between UK and EU, though NI would be aligned to other rules of the single market.
824256050	36	Two problems are related to this.
824256050	37	One is that May does not favor a permanent customs deal lest it prevent British free trade deals with other countries.
824256050	38	The other is that her proposals have twice been defeated in the House of Commons, on January 15, 2019 by 432-202, and on February 14, 2019 by 303-258.
824256050	39	In the latter vote, her own Conservative party, 5 voted against her, and 67 others abstained.
824256050	40	The essential features of the EU, single market and customs union, allow people, goods, and services to enter other EU countries without inspection.
824256050	41	The basic problem is that if Britain leaves the EU it will probably lead to delays and checks in this policy.
824256050	42	The reality would be that the ROI and NI would be in different customs and regulatory regimes, and British goods would be checked at the border.
824256050	43	The backstop, a last resort, is intended to prevent full border controls on goods crossing between ROI and NI.
824256050	44	For Britain one problem is that it can only end the backstop arrangement with EU agreement.
824256050	45	The issue is both economic and political.
824256050	46	The fear is that barriers between North and South Ireland might revive the old animosity, the Troubles, the 30-year conflict over NI status as part of the UK.Military controls of the 500-kilometer border were only removed with the Good Friday agreement which provided for more collaboration and free movement between the two entities..
824256050	47	Irish and British politics enter into the picture.
824256050	48	For 10 years in NI the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein worked together in a government coalition.
824256050	49	Power sharing in NI ended in on January 9, 2017 because of differences between the major parties over the issue of green energy.
824256050	50	It led to the general election of June 8, 2017 which resulted in a hung parliament.
824256050	51	The Conservatives won 42,4% of the vote and gained 318 of the 50 seats, less than a majority; the Labour Party got 40.0% of the vote and 262 seats.
824256050	52	Of the Irish parties.
824256050	53	DUP got 10 and Sinn Fein 7.
824256050	54	The UK government therefore relies on the DUP for a majority vote in the House of Commons, which it has twice lost.
824256050	55	The Republic of Ireland, like NI, would suffer from a hard border.
824256050	56	At the same time, it is benefitting from London-based groups banking institutions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays, asset management, and insurance companies, who want to retain access to EU markets.
824256050	57	ROI will also benefit from pharmaceutical and legal firms which are moving business to Dublin.
824256050	58	The dilemma of Brexit negotiations continues, especially since PM May does not have full support from her Conservative party.
824256050	59	The EU may be less inclined to make compromise concessions in view of May’s lack of control of her party.
824256050	60	A major problem is that the scheduled departure of UK from the EU on March 29 may have to be delayed because of the difficulties in agreeing on future trade and economic relations.
824256050	61	The immediate issue is to identity “backstop” with full clarity, or find a suitable alternative, to prevent a hard border.
824350729	1	‘Go join Farage’s new party’: Tory minister lashes out at Rees-Mogg’s ‘treacherous’ Brexiteers
824350729	3	A Tory cabinet minister has launched a scathing attack on hardline Brexiteer faction, the ERG, after claiming they “drank champagne to celebrate” PM May’s deal being defeated – telling them to defect to Nigel Farage’s new party.
824350729	4	In an interview for The House magazine, business minister Richard Harrington accused the European Research Group, headed by prominent backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg of “treachery,” claiming that in his “view they’re not Conservatives.”
824350729	5	Also on rt.com May mocked after claiming 'I wanted Brexit sorted by Christmas,' as SNP’s Blackford calls her a liar
824350729	6	Harrington, who voted ‘remain’ in the 2016 EU referendum, and has himself intimated that he would be willing to quit May’s cabinet if no-deal Brexit became government policy urged ERG members to join a party that was more in line with their vision for the UK.
824350729	7	“I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called ‘Brexit’ and if I were them I’d be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative Party does,” Harrington suggested.
824350729	8	The government minister was giving his views in the aftermath of Theresa May losing a vote (303-258) on her Brexit deal, that sought to give her more time to negotiate with the EU, changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
824350729	9	The ERG abstained on the vote, with its deputy chairman, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister claiming they couldn’t back something that took “no-deal off the table.”
824350729	10	May’s defeat last night, albeit on a vote that was legally non-binding, has triggered a Tory civil war with cracks appearing within the PM’s cabinet, specifically on the issue of taking the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal – off the table.
824350729	11	Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Britain is prepared to leave the bloc without a divorce deal, insisting the only way to avoid such a scenario is for the UK parliament to vote for May’s Brexit agreement.
824350729	12	No.
824350729	13	We won’t.
824350729	14	We are not leaving without a deal.
824350729	15	If you want to leave, you’d better agree one.

824350729	18	However, foreign office and international development minister, Alistair Burt, has lambasted such suggestions, taking to social media to claim: “We are not leaving without a deal,” in a reply to former Brexit Secretary David Davis.
824350729	19	The PM’s defeat on Thursday night was her 11th on Brexit in 14 months.
824350729	20	It further adds to the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and arguably undermines her pledge to EU leaders that she would be able to gain a good majority of MPs to support her deal.

824658990	3	A group of Labour MPs have announced that they are quitting the party and will sit as Independent MPs in the house of commons, hitting out at leader Jeremy Corbyn for presiding over an "institutionally anti-Semitic" party.
824658990	4	The seven Labour MPs quitting the party to become 'The Independent Group', are Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey.
824658990	5	Announcing their resignations in Westminster, Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree took to the stage first, to claim that she could not stay in the party any more because it had become "institutionally anti-Semitic."
824658990	6	Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, a prominent 'People's Vote' advocate appealed to all MPs, not just Labour, to join their group, as the current parties are part of the problem, not the solution.
824658990	7	He argued that “It is time we dumped this country’s old fashioned politics.” Umunna claimed the UK needed a political party “fit for the hear and now” and the “first step in leaving the tribal politics behind."

824658990	9	Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, insisted that it had not been an easy decision to make but that he believed that the Labour Party had been hijacked by the “machine politics of the hard left."
824658990	10	Labour has been dogged by accusations of acting too slowly in investigating claims of anti-Semitism within the party.
824658990	11	The issue became such a toxic issue for the party that it even led to veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge allegedly calling Corbyn an “anti-Semite" in the house of commons.
824658990	12	Labour’s governing body, finally agreed in September to adopt the IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism with all 11 examples following highly charged debate over its pitfalls, with accusations that free speech in relation to Palestine could be curtailed.
824658990	13	Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, revealed that it had been a very painful decision to resign her membership but suggested the current Labour party were guilty of patronizing the electorate.
824658990	15	Today, seven MPs have left Labour and formed a new, Independent Group.

824658990	18	Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, in perhaps a dig at Corbyn'sforeign policyy, says the new independent group “does not think every problem in the world has been created by the west.”
824658990	19	Ann Coffey, MP for Stockport, says the Labour party is no longer a broad church.
824658990	20	“The current leadership has been very successful at changing the party beyond recognition,” she says.
824658990	21	“Loyalty cannot be an end in itself.”
824658990	22	Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South, says he is sickened by anti-Semitism in the party and angry that the Labour leadership is facilitating Brexit.

824658990	26	Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has reacted to the news by saying he is saddened by the decision of MPs to leave the party.
824658990	27	In a statement Corbyn said: "I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945."

824684605	1	Seven U.K. Labour Lawmakers Quit Over Jeremy Corbyn's Handling of Brexit and Anti-Semitism
824684605	3	LONDON—Britain’s nervous breakdown in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union has mostly been felt by Theresa May and lawmakers in her Conservative party, who have been at each other’s throats for two years as they stumble towards Brexit.
824684605	4	But the main opposition party—Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour—has also been coming apart at the seams.
824684605	5	That became even clearer Monday when seven of its lawmakers, unable to back their left-wing leader on Brexit or the way he’s dealt with anti-Semitism in the party, decided to quit.
824684605	6	Some of the reasons given by the seven members of parliament [MPs] at their dramatic press conference were similar to the bitter arguments which have seen Conservative party politicians angrily fighting amongst themselves.
824684605	7	Namely, a complete disagreement with their leader on how to go forward with the Brexit referendum result.
824684605	8	One of the seven, Chris Leslie, accused Corbyn of a “betrayal” on Europe by helping to enable May's vision of Brexit and refusing to back a second referendum on the issue.
824684605	9	Although he claims he voted to stay in the EU, Corbyn has been a long-time critic of the bloc and many in his party suspect he’s quite happy to see Britain leave.
824684605	10	But it’s the problems unique to Labour that appear to have made the seven most angry and led to the biggest split in the party since the early 1980s.
824684605	11	Luciana Berger, a Jewish MP who’s been a frequent target of anti-Semites in the party, said that she'd come to the “sickening conclusion” that the party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic.”
824684605	12	The Labour party has been plagued by anti-Semitism incidents since Corbyn became leader with the backing of tens of thousands of new left-wing members.
824684605	13	A string of incidents last year saw a joint editorial published by the country’s three most prominent Jewish newspapers claiming that a government led by him would pose an “existential threat” to Jews living in Britain.
824684605	14	Leslie agreed with Berger, saying that Labour been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left,” while another of the seven, Mike Gapes, declared angrily: “I am sickened that Labour is now perceived by many as a racist, anti-Semitic party.”
824684605	15	Berger said she’d become "embarrassed and ashamed" to stay in the party, and added that she felt like she was “leaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation.
824684605	16	I look forward to a future serving with colleagues who respect each other.”
824684605	17	How many of her former colleagues might join her is unclear.
824684605	18	Several MPs who’ve been severely critical of Corbyn since he became leader have issued statements saying that they still think trying to change the party from within is the best way forward, but that Corbyn has to see Monday’s resignations as the final warning.
824684605	19	The seven also made a clear appeal to members of other parties who are uncomfortable with their leaders to join them, with some Conservatives appearing to be open to the idea.
824684605	20	The group, and whoever else joins it, will now sit in House of Commons as a loose group of independent members of parliament rather than as a new party.
824684605	21	The seven rejected comparisons with the Social Democratic Party [SDP] which broke away from the Labour Party in the early 1980s but eventually merged with the Liberal Party.
824684605	22	The SDP is often reviled in Labour history for splitting left-wing voters and helping Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative dominate British politics for a decade.
824684605	23	Another one of the seven, one-time Labour leadership contender Chuka Umunna, declared at the press conference: "Politics is broken.
824684605	24	It doesn't have to be this way.
824684605	25	Let's change it.”
824684605	26	It’s obvious to anyone with a passing interest in British politics that the current system is broken.
824684605	27	Whether this breakaway can fix it, or indeed if anything can, is far from clear.
828866387	1	Brexit in 23 days: EU says still 'no solution'
828866387	3	(DW.COM) – Just over three weeks before the UK walks out of the European Union, there has been no breakthrough to amend Britain’s divorce deal.
828866387	4	The deadlock between the EU and Britain is centered on the so-called Irish backstop.
828866387	5	The European Union said Wednesday there has been no progress in the latest talks with Britain, just days before the UK lawmakers are set for a second vote to avoid a hard Brexit.
828866387	6	EU diplomats led by negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterparts met in Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to amend their divorce deal before Britain’s scheduled exit on March 29.
828866387	7	Read more: Brexit: Why is the Irish backstop so controversial?
828866387	8	“Michel Barnier has informed…that while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere, discussions have been difficult,” said Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive.
828866387	9	“No solution has been identified at this point that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will not be reopened,” Schinas said.
829267754	1	Theresa May Doesn’t Have the Votes
829267754	3	Theresa May still does not appear to have the votes for her deal.
829267754	4	What then?
829267754	5	Extend and PretendEurointelligence says You Really Should Not Take EU’s Willingness to Extend for Granted.
829267754	6	One of the dangers of the Brexit debate is that everybody is making hidden assumptions about what others will do.
829267754	7	One of these assumptions is that the EU would only be too happy to extend the Brexit deadline.
829267754	8	The EU would, of course, extend to give time for ratification of a deal or even to make way for a cross-party deal.
829267754	9	But Theresa May would have to make clear pretty quickly that this is what she wants to do after the meaningful vote goes against her for a second time – which may well happen.
829267754	10	However, the idea that the EU is willing to accept a long extension, or a semi-permanent one, is fanciful for a number of reasons.
829267754	11	The most important relates to power politics within the EU.
829267754	12	The EPP has to be mindful of the impact a long delay would have on the balance of power, especially if it were to expel Viktor Orban.
829267754	13	If the UK were forced to hold European elections in May it would not send a single delegate to the EPP, which means that the EPP’s relative position in the parliament would weaken further.
829267754	14	A long delay would almost certain lead to an outcry among Brexit supporters, and could trigger a groundswell of support for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party.
829267754	15	It appears to us that opposition to May’s deal among pro-Brexit MPs is hardening again – partly based on those delusions.
829267754	16	Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details) If the meaningful vote is negative – as it may well be – we assume that May would at this point try to reach a cross-party agreement to open up the discussion on the future relationship, by giving the House of Commons the right to pass instructions to the government for the post-Brexit negotiations.
829267754	17	At that point, a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	18	In Brussels, meanwhile, the UK-EU talks are becoming more concrete.
829267754	19	Tony Connelly writes in RTE that the two sides were working on three separate strands: one on the guarantee of the backstop’s temporary nature; a second on the technological solutions that might replace the backstop; and a third on how to change the political declaration.
829267754	20	Negotiations are now in the hot phase – with an agreement due probably on Monday.
829267754	21	We doubt that the two sides would want to give the British press much time to take this deal apart.
829267754	22	Soft Brexit?
829267754	23	Eurointelligence assumes a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	24	But I am not certain what they means by a soft Brexit.
829267754	25	Regardless, unless there is some sort of binding guarantee by the EU as a backstop replacement, one can hardly be certain of anything.
829267754	26	Deal or No Deal?​
829267754	27	Christopher Howarth, a senior research analyst for the House of Commons, says Deal or No deal, Brexit Cannot be Stopped.
829267754	28	Howarth concludes “If the Government brings back the same deal without an exit to the backstop, it will be defeated.
829267754	29	If it is defeated, there will be no second referendum or prolonged stay in the EU.
829267754	30	The UK will leave.
829267754	31	In short, don’t panic: if MPs hold their nerve, we are leaving the EU on 29th March without a permanent backstop.”
829267754	32	In short, Howarth either believes the EU will budge or there will be a no-deal Brexit.
829267754	33	I am not as confident as Howarth but I believe his take is more likely than that of Eurointelligence.
829267754	34	Crunching the Numbers – Guardian
829267754	35	The Guardian did the math as it stands today [March 5 as reported by Eurointelligence] : May needs an additional 110 votes to get the deal through – from a pool of 115 Tory MPs and 40 Labour MPs in leave-voting seats.
829267754	36	There are 7 pro-Remain Tory MPs who said they will vote against the deal without a referendum.
829267754	37	This leaves a total of 148 MPs.
829267754	38	If 10-20 Tory Brexiteers reject the deal, she will need to pick up some 20-30 or so Labour MPs to get it through.
829267754	39	And it seems that the best way to get those Labour MPs lined up would be an open vote on the future relationship, including the option a customs union.
829267754	40	There is no chance of the UK parliament aligning behind any option for so long as Brexit itself has not happened.
829267754	41	But, once it has, the probability of agreement is large simply because the more extreme Brexit options – leave without a deal or re-run the referendum – will have been eliminated.
829267754	42	This is why a two-stage ratification is much more likely to succeed than a once-and-for-all vote.
829267754	43	Convoluted Position
829267754	44	The Eurointelligence position seems more than a bit convoluted.

829267754	46	Supposedly, once Brexit happens, leave without a deal will be off the table.
829267754	47	Not Enough Votes
829267754	48	Bloomberg’s Brexit Bulletin concludes Not Enough Votes
829267754	49	Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief whip told the Cabinet on Tuesday he’s not confident he has the numbers to get her exit accord approved next week, and predicted that a defeat would be followed by Parliament forcing the U.K. to maintain closer ties with the European Union.
829267754	50	Julian Smith, the man with the impossible job of manufacturing majorities for May’s Brexit policy, told ministers that the vote will be tight and he doesn’t know which way it’s going to go, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
829267754	51	Meanwhile, the signals from the Labour camp don’t look good for May.
829267754	52	Labour officials are sounding increasingly upbeat that they will be able to contain the potential voting rebellion in their ranks.
829267754	53	Speaking privately, three officials said they’re confident fewer than 10 Labour lawmakers would vote with May, even though whips have as many as 30 members of Parliament on their list of potential rebels.
829267754	54	The less likely the deal is to pass, the less inclined wavering lawmakers might be to risk their careers to back it.
829267754	55	May’s latest efforts to get Labour MPs on board are falling flat.
829267754	56	Cash handouts for pro-Brexit regions were widely criticized earlier this week and the government’s long-awaited announcement on protecting workers’ rights after Brexit — also aimed at giving Labour MPs an excuse to back the agreement — have been slammed as insufficient.
829267754	57	Meaningful Vote
829267754	58	The first two Bloomberg paragraphs above sound like hogwash and fearmongering by Theresa May.
829267754	59	The second two paragraphs are more realistic.
829267754	60	Unless the EU agrees to modify the backstop in a meaningful way the vote will go down.
829267754	61	If it’s close, then expect May to keep submitting it to vote.
829267754	62	That’s way I don’t have overriding confidence in the opinion of Howarth.
829267754	63	If a vote fails a second time May will put forth an amendment to take no-deal off the Table.
829267754	64	The problem for May and the UK parliament is such a vote is not legally binding.
829267754	65	The UK leaves on March 29 unless the UK parliament passes something the EU agree with.
829267754	66	That’s why I have no confidence in the opinion of Eurointelligence.
829267754	67	Curiously, Eurointelligence says don’t take for granted the EU will extend, yet it fully expects an extension.
829267754	68	I expect one too, but lasting no longer than June.
829267754	69	Otherwise, the UK will be represented in the EU parliament and will make a mess of things.
829267754	70	Malthouse Compromise
829267754	71	I keep returning to the Malthouse Compromise.
829267754	72	It is the one solution that seems to be a reasonable alternative for everyone but the hard remainers.
829267754	73	Under the Malthouse Compromise, Brexit happens and the backstop stays in place for a maximum of two years.
829267754	74	Then and only then is there a hard Brexit, assuming the UK and EU cannot come up with a backstop replacement.
829267754	75	The EU labels this a unicorn.
829267754	76	If the Brexiteers repeatedly hold their ground, I expect something like the Malthouse compromise to win.
829267754	77	Theresa May may resign first, or not.
829267754	78	But if so, Tories are back in the lead in polls, and there is the possibility they can pick a suitable candidate that could get a majority right now.

829815104	1	Brussels Shows Its Fear
829815104	3	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been under fire from the European Union for years for his opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open immigration policy.
829815104	4	A policy which she herself has had to pull back on.
829815104	5	And no matter how far Merkel has changed her stance and acceded to the reality of the damage her policy has created, Orban is still guilty of the sin of non-compliance.
829815104	6	Actually, he’s guilty of a whole lot more than that.
829815104	7	Because Orban has not only stepped on the third-rail of European politics he’s stomped up and down while taking a massive dump on it.
829815104	8	That third-rail, of course, is naming names.
829815104	9	Naming the very person who controls so much of EU policy through his co-opting large swaths of the European parliament.That person, of course, is George Soros.
829815104	10	Now there is a push, ahead of May’s European Parliamentary elections, to kick Orban’s dominant Fidesz party out of the European People’s Party (EPP), a nominal center-right coalition and the largest single party within the EU parliament.

829815104	12	And with each victory over Soros Orban grows even bolder.
829815104	13	After a successful re-election campaign predicated on the slogan, “Don’t Let Soros Win,” Orban has banned Soros’ major NGO, Open Society Foundation, as well as forced out his Central European University.
829815104	14	But his biggest sin was equating outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude “When things get tough you have to lie” Juncker with Soros’ attempts to weaken Hungary’s border.
829815104	15	His reward for this, and building a border fence which thwarts Soros and Merkel’s tactic of tying immigrants in the host country in legal limbo for years by being inset from Hungary’s actual border, has been an Article 7 procedure opened up against Hungary for not abiding by the EU’s position on human rights.
829815104	16	Poland is in similar hot water with Merkel but thanks to one of the few reasonable things within the EU’s framework, each country can use the other to veto the actual censuring and concomitant removal of voting rights within the Union that comes with the full application of Article 7.
829815104	17	But this article isn’t really about Orban’s latest troubles with the faux democrats within the EU parliament.
829815104	18	It’s about how scared those people are of the rise in Euroskeptics like Orban across the continent ahead of May’s elections.
829815104	19	Orban’s potential expulsion from the EPP is just another symptom of this fear.
829815104	20	Recently, France’s Marine Le Pen, found out that the trial against her for tweeting out images of ISIS beheadings back in 2015, will go forward with the potential of landing her in jail for three years.
829815104	21	This is not much different than the kidnapping charge Sicilian prosecutors tried to bring against Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of Lega and all-around bad boy Matteo Salvini in Italy.
829815104	22	This was a lame attempt to split Italy’s Euroskeptic coalition and keep it focused on internal trivialities versus mounting a real challenge in May’s elections.
829815104	23	The same is true now for Le Pen.
829815104	24	Her National Rally party is polling within the margin of error of President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche with a real chance to send a plurality of French Euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels in a couple of months.
829815104	25	Merkel is struggling with the same thing.
829815104	26	And even though support for Alternative for Germany (AfD) has waned in recent polling, down to just 13%, don’t underestimate the voters’ desire to send a strong message to Brussels by voting in stronger numbers for the new or alternative parties rather than how they would vote for them at home.
829815104	27	We’ve seen this in the past with UKIP who shocked everyone in the last European elections in 2014 with the size of the vote for them.
829815104	28	It never translated into domestic momentum as typical prisoner’s dilemma concerns are more prevalent in Britain’s majoritarian voting system.
829815104	29	But for the EU parliament where the two-party system doesn’t hold sway and the direct benefits are harder to make a case to voters for, it’s much more likely voters will loosen up a little and throw their support for a smaller, less established party.
829815104	30	And that, along with some serious miscalculations about Brexit which I’ll get to in a minute, has the power elite in European political circles very scared.
829815104	31	So scared that they are willing to devote serious resources in Quixotic endeavors of dubious value.
829815104	32	Expelling Orban from the EPP will only give him more strength.
829815104	33	It will only give Euroskeptics more ammunition.
829815104	34	Orban, like Salvini, revels in being the outsider.
829815104	35	He’ll use it to rally others across Eastern Europe and pull a few more seats into that orbit.
829815104	36	According to the latest polling, which you can find an up-to-date tally of here, Euroskeptic parties will take between 215 and 225 seats out of the 705 up for grabs, assuming Britain actually leaves and doesn’t stand for MEP elections, which at this point doesn’t look likely.

829815104	38	If reports are true that Prime Minister Theresa May cut a deal with Merkel in July of last year on the withdrawal agreement.
829815104	39	And if that agreement was structured so as to ease the way for the U.K. to rejoin the EU later are true, then there is no way Mrs. May will be able to forestall Brexit on WTO terms at this point, even if it takes another 90 days to do so.
829815104	40	A report from the Bruges Group, since taken down, had the details (see link above).
829815104	41	And we’ll know if this is the case if suddenly Theresa May agrees to step aside as Prime Minister just after March 29th whether or not Britain leaves.
829815104	42	Because she will have either failed to scuttle Brexit and be sacrificed to save the Tories.
829815104	43	Or she steps aside for a true Brexiteer in the event of Parliament voting for an extension.
829815104	44	We’ll know this was the case if she does so.
829815104	45	Lots of ifs, I know, but right now everyone is doing the Juncker-Two-Step, lying and cajoling to maintain the status quo and continue forward towards further European integration.
829815104	46	Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank did his part, going full dove for the rest of 2019 to keep markets from imploding.
829815104	47	And if Brexit is settled on WTO terms that opens up their worst nightmare going forward.
829815104	48	Watch Viktor Orban smile the smile of the just at that point.

830153674	1	Britain’s Attorney General Deals Blow to May’s Rejigged Brexit Deal
830153674	3	Britain’s attorney general has dealt a potentially fatal blow to Theresa May’s rejigged Brexit deal as lawmakers prepare to vote on it later today.
830153674	4	The prime minister returned from Europe late Monday night with what she claimed were “legally binding” changes to the deal that was overwhelmingly rejected last month.
830153674	5	She claims the changes mean the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
830153674	6	Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has published legal advice that shoots down some of her claims.
830153674	7	He writes that if Britain wanted to remove itself from the backstop, it “would have… no internationally lawful means of exiting the [the backstop] arrangements, save by agreement [with the EU].” Support for the rejigged deal likely hinged on Cox’s confirmation that something substantial had changed.
830153674	8	The deal now appears to be heading for its second defeat in the House of Commons.
830274102	1	Theresa May Defeated Again as U.K. ‘Shitshow’ Threatens to Block Brexit
830274102	3	LONDON—It’s 17 days until Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
830274102	4	For just under two years, the British government has diverted all of its energy into hammering out a deal to ensure its exit was as smooth as possible.
830274102	5	On Tuesday night, it appeared that those efforts had amounted to absolutely nothing—and no one knows what happens next.
830274102	6	Despite Theresa May’s desperate 11th-hour attempts to polish her Brexit deal into something acceptable to lawmakers after they rejected it with the most overwhelming government defeat in British parliamentary history in January, the rejigged deal was knocked back again this evening in another whopping, and humiliating defeat—by 391 votes to 242.
830274102	7	The prime minister flew back from Strasbourg late Monday night with what she proudly claimed were “legally binding” changes to her deal.
830274102	8	She said the changes meant the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
830274102	9	She presented the plan to lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday morning—but a familiar disaster befell her.
830274102	10	Clearly feeling the strain of the late-night negotiations, her voice failed her and she croaked and spluttered her way through her crucial chance to sell her deal.
830274102	11	It wasn’t the first time: She famously suffered every keynote speaker’s worst nightmare in 2017 when her voice failed and her backdrop fell to pieces at the Tory party annual conference.
830274102	12	Lawmakers were not convinced by the faltering performance.
830274102	13	Britain’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox published legal advice Tuesday morning which rejected the idea that the changes would allow Britain to legally decide to exit the backstop without the agreement of the EU, potentially forcing it to adhere to the bloc’s customs rules against its will.
830274102	14	The staunchly anti-EU wing of May’s Conservative party, the European Research Group, announced they couldn’t back it.
830274102	15	Then the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party—whose support May relies on for winning votes with her minority government—also disowned it.
830274102	16	Its fate was sealed hours before the results came in on Tuesday evening.
830274102	17	“It’s a shitshow,” one Conservative MP told The Daily Beast.
830274102	18	Another, Sir Mike Penning, said: “It’s reached the stage where we don’t know what the hell is going to happen.”
830274102	19	What happens next doesn’t seem to be clear to anyone.
830274102	20	In the short term, there’s likely to be two more key votes in the House of Commons this week.
830274102	21	One will determine whether Parliament consents to leave the EU with no deal—which, based on previous results, is likely to be rejected.
830274102	22	The other will see lawmakers vote on whether to extend the 29 March 2019 deadline the U.K. set itself to leave the EU nearly two years ago.
830274102	23	That result is harder to predict as even lawmakers who think it’s a good idea will face a backlash from some constituents who will accuse them of trying to abandon the entire Brexit project.
830274102	24	What happens in the longer term is anyone’s guess.
830274102	25	Lawmakers are talking about a number of scenarios: a third vote on May’s deal either before or after a deadline extension; the highly uncertain scenario of leaving with no deal; or taking it to the public with a second referendum, or even a general election.
830274102	26	In one scenario forecast by Tory grandee Sir Charles Walker, May will now be forced to call a general election to try and end the impasse.
830274102	27	The vice chairman of the influential Conservative 1922 Committee said the administration had dissolved into chaos and—for the first time in at least a century—Britain’s government was incapable of functioning.
830274102	28	“If it was a horse with a broken fetlock, this Parliament, you’d probably put it down,” he said on Sky News.
830274102	29	There is also frustration among the more pragmatic MPs who feel the prime minister has done everything she can to compromise with the pro-Brexit lawmakers, and their intransigence is now the only thing that could prevent Brexit entirely.
830274102	30	One possibility—if all other options such as no deal or a deadline extension are ruled out—is that the deal is voted on a third time and, faced with prospect no Brexit happening at all, it’s passed.
830274102	31	“The reality is Brexiteer MPs need to come on board,” Paul Masterton MP told The Daily Beast.
830274102	32	“If they don’t, then they are putting their precious project at risk.
830274102	33	This is as Brexity as it’s going to get for them.
830274102	34	If the deal is defeated then all bets are off."
830274102	35	One of the few Conservative MPs who fell in behind May on Tuesday night after previously voting against the deal said he was partly motivated by the new concessions from Brussels but “more importantly if we don’t, there’s a good chance we won’t get any form of Brexit at all.”
830274102	36	Penning, who helped run May’s leadership campaign, had previously described the prime minister’s deal as “dead as a dodo” but he told The Daily Beast he had changed his mind because he feared his parliamentary colleagues would vote later this week “to block hard Brexit, which means we’ve got no negotiating position; so we’re stuffed—in this limbo forever and a day.”
830274102	37	However, Penning rejected Walker’s suggestion of a general election.
830274102	38	“Charlie is entitled to his opinion but firstly you need two-thirds of the House to vote for it, that ain’t gonna happen,” he said.
830274102	39	Penning dismissed speculation that No.
830274102	40	10 had encouraged Walker to go rogue in TV and radio studios ahead of the vote in order to try and scare a few more Conservatives into backing the prime minister.
830274102	41	“You don’t know Charlie Walker; he’s a very independently minded MP.”
830274102	42	In a bid to stave off an earlier defeat, May was forced to accept that if her deal was rejected for a second time, she would allow MPs to hold a vote the following day on whether they would accept a no-deal Brexit.
830274102	43	Since the triggering of Article 50—Britain’s formal request to leave the EU—a two-year countdown to March 29, 2019, began.
830274102	44	According to legislation passed by the House and still on the books, Britain will automatically plunge out of the EU in 17 days even if there is no withdrawal agreement.
830274102	45	A large majority of MPs believe that would be extremely damaging to Britain as decades of trade deals, cross-border agreements, regulations and rights would disappear in a puff of smoke.
830274102	46	It is therefore likely that the House of Commons will vote against no deal, that prospect increased when May reacted to her defeat by declaring that there would be a “free vote”—that means the government effectively does not even have a policy on one of the most important votes in a generation.
830274102	47	If Parliament does reject no-deal Brexit, another vote would be automatically triggered for Thursday.
830274102	48	This time the question put to lawmakers will be: Should Britain request a delay to Brexit?
830274102	49	It is much harder to predict how that vote would play out as both of the main party leaders have effectively lost control of their MPs and would not be able to enforce the party whip.
830274102	50	Substantial numbers of politicians on both sides believe delaying Brexit would be an insult to the electorate who voted to quite the EU in 2016; while similarly large numbers believe no deal must be avoided at all costs.
830274102	51	There is also a smaller group of MPs who are plotting to hold a second referendum and would therefore vote for as long a delay to Brexit as possible.
830274102	52	For once May captured the mood of the House of Commons late Tuesday night when she said: “These are unenviable choices.
830274102	53	Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”
830274102	54	Whatever Britain wants to do next, with 17 days to go until its membership of the European Union expires, it’s time to make a decision.
830359136	1	The Fight for Brexit
830359136	3	To see how serious the political elite’s war on Brexit has become, consider this: Tony Blair has been having secret talks with French president Emmanuel Macron on how to prevent Brexit from becoming a reality.
830359136	4	Apparently, Blair has told Macron to ‘stand [his] ground’ against any kind of so-called Hard Brexit and to use his clout, and the EU’s clout, to pressure Britain to stay in the Customs Union and maybe even to hold a second referendum.
830359136	5	To put this in plain, blunt English: a former British prime minister is conspiring with a foreign power to try to subvert the will of the British people.
830359136	6	In normal times, this would be a scandal of epic, epoch-defining proportions.
830359136	7	There might have been riots, certainly protests.
830359136	8	Blair would have been publicly shamed, possibly exiled.
830359136	9	His name would live in infamy.
830359136	10	But we don’t live in normal times.
830359136	11	We live in an era in which most of the political class has ditched even the pretence of feeling a strong attachment to democracy.
830359136	12	An era in reactionary anti-democratic sentiment is more casually expressed than at any other time in living memory.
830359136	13	An era in which the chattering classes nonchalantly call for the overthrow of the largest vote in British history (the vote for Brexit), in which parliamentarians explicitly pit themselves against the people’s will, and in which anyone who so much as raises a peep about any aspect of this polite tyranny will be slammed as a hard-right menace to public life.

830359136	16	And so there is no widespread outrage over the fact that a former British PM is meeting with a tinpot Jupiterian who has subjected his own people to months of extreme violence.
830359136	17	No frontpage denunciations of this Brit who has sided with the most violently repressive leader in Europe to try to ensure that the largest number of voters in British history don’t get what they want.
830359136	18	Indeed, I bet that if anyone were to suggest that Blair is a traitor, they would be railed against.
830359136	19	And yet, look up the word traitor in the dictionary.
830359136	20	‘A person who stops being loyal to their own country.’ What more apt description is there of a powerful Briton who is working with a foreign power to thwart the British people’s political desires?
830359136	21	‘How DARE you call us traitors?
830359136	22	!’ – Remainer elitists do protest too much.
830359136	23	The Blair / Macron love-in is in some ways a better snapshot of where Britain is at right now than what will happen in parliament this week.
830359136	24	For it reveals a bigger, more important truth than the parliamentary tussles over customs unions and delays to Article 50 do.
830359136	25	It confirms that the crisis facing Britain right now is not a technical one of how to leave the EU and whether leaving the EU will cause economic difficulty.
830359136	26	Rather, it is a crisis of democracy.
830359136	27	It is a situation in which the very democratic premise upon which modern Britain has been built – at least since 1928, when all adults, including women under 30, got the right to vote – is being called into question.
830359136	28	The scrapping over ‘how’ we Brexit disguises the far more profound question that has been thrown up by the British masses’ disobedient vote to Leave in June 2016.

830359423	3	After a lot of drama, British Prime Minister Theresa May came back from Brussels with a breakthrough on Brexit.
830359423	4	Only it wasn’t.
830359423	5	While the changes to the protocol that governs the implementation of the Irish Backstop are an improvement they are far fro enough to allay the rightful fears of Brexiteers and the Northern Irish.
830359423	6	From the beginning of this process, the EU has been in blackmail mode.
830359423	7	They’ve made it clear that they would not negotiate in good faith or even at all.
830359423	8	That much has been clear.
830359423	9	The biggest question has been whether May herself was working in the British people’s best interest or was she simply a stalking horse for further EU integration of the entire continent of Europe.
830359423	10	Never forget that the EU has imperial ambitions.
830359423	11	Those that have been its architects saw it as regaining the mantle of the center of the world as the U.S. bankrupts itself maintaining an empire around the world, fighting against the rise of Russia and China.

830359423	18	Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.
830359423	19	This point cannot be understated.
830359423	20	Because it is the model for how the EU will fight the rising opposition to its rule.
830359423	21	The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.
830359423	22	It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.
830359423	23	It was designed to cause irreparable damage to the U.K. with the long-term effects of destroying the majority political parties and fanning separatist instincts in Wales and Scotland.
830359423	24	And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no-deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.
830359423	25	Poll after poll shows overwhelming rejection of May’s Merkel’s deal as well as growing support for a No-Deal Brexit.
830359423	26	And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.
830359423	27	Businesses are relocating, shipments are stopping, etc.
830359423	28	All because of Brexit, they argue.
830359423	29	No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.
830359423	30	Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.
830359423	31	Theresa May’s performance in parliament before the latest vote was almost convincing.
830359423	32	But, as always, when someone is giving you an ultimatum, my way or the highway, it’s masking an alternative choice.
830359423	33	The Dublin Unionist Party and the European Research Group within the Tories understand this.
830359423	34	I suspect in his heart of hearts Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn
830359423	35	And the reason for this is May was always on their side.
830359423	36	It’s not a negotiation when there’s only one side represented.
830359423	37	This is why Juncker et.al.
830359423	38	refused to negotiate in any meaningful way.
830359423	39	They didn’t have to.
830359423	40	Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details)
830359423	41	And that is simply blackmail.
830359423	42	What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.
830359423	43	Because any organization that would blackmail rather than negotiate is not an organization anyone decent person would want to be a member of.
830359423	44	Fears over a No-Deal Brexit are overblown.
830359423	45	If these same MP’s that are so worried about the uncertainty created by the Brexit process would simply end that uncertainty by backing No-Deal then certainty would return.
830359423	46	It might not be the certainty that is the easiest to swallow for both sides but it will be certainty.
830359423	47	Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.
830359423	48	That’s an insult and it should be treated as such by Parliament.
830359423	49	But it won’t be as MP’s roll over, show Juncker their bellies and hand-wring about how unfair it all is again later this week.
830359423	50	They cannot see the bigger picture that it is the EU that has the weak hand, not them.
830359423	51	They are too blinded by ideology and fear to see that.

830821478	1	Britain Begs the EU for a Brexit Deadline Extension to Work Out What it Actually Wants
830821478	3	Britain will beg the European Union for a delay to its EU withdrawal to give a desperate Theresa May more time to find a way out her Brexit mess.
830821478	4	In a series of votes Thursday, members of parliament [MPs] voted to instruct May to go back to the EU to request a new Brexit deadline.
830821478	5	The British government wants to extend the current deadline for three months if May’s hated Brexit deal is approved by March 29.
830821478	6	If she can’t get that through parliament, there could be a much longer delay.
830821478	7	Britain can’t decide to extend the Brexit deadline by itself, however.
830821478	8	That will require the approval of each member state of the EU which is by no means guaranteed unless May can give them good reason to allow her more time for to work on a deal many consider to be dead.
830821478	9	If British lawmakers don’t approve May’s deal by March 29, and an extension isn’t approved by the EU, then the country is still set to crash out of the bloc without a deal in 15 days.
830821478	10	Earlier in the day, the government revealed it intended to hold a third vote on May’s deal some time next week.
830821478	11	If it completes a trilogy of defeats, MPs will then get to vote on a range of options to indicate exactly how they want to proceed without May’s deal and without leaving with no deal.
830821478	12	However, changing course would cause a much longer Brexit delay which the government warned could cause “real damage to the public's faith” in politics.
830821478	13	A British government minister told The Daily Beast that the prime minister will now begin what amounts to a bribery campaign in which she’ll throw money at members of parliament for their pet projects to win their backing for her deal by the end of the new propsed deadline.
830821478	14	“I suspect the big HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] chequebook is about to be dusted off and promissory notes to fall like confetti,” said the minister
830821478	15	The government also hopes the threat of a much longer delay will force the hand of the anti-EU MPs who voted against her deal—believing it would keep the U.K. too closely entwined with Europe—and bring them into line in a potentially-decisive third vote to make sure Brexit happens.
830821478	16	A spokesman for the European Commission reiterated that a deadline extension would require the “unanimous agreement” of all its member states, and each leader will have to “consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.”
830821478	17	A separate vote Thursday saw lawmakers overwhelmingly reject the idea of a second referendum on independence.
830821478	18	Although it wasn’t a legally-binding vote and doesn’t completely rule out the prospect of another referendum, the number of lawmakers who voted against it indicate it is unlikely to win a majority at any time in the near future.
830821478	19	MPs also rejected the chance to wrestle the Brexit process away from the prime minister by turning down a measure which would have given them control of parliamentary time next week to arrange a series of votes on alternative brexit options.
830821478	20	That measure—rejected by just two votes—would have allowed MPs to find a way forward on Brexit without May’s deal.
830821478	21	That means MPs have this week voted against May’s deal, against leaving the EU with no deal, against holding a second referendum, and against using their power to find an alternative route to get Britain out of the Brexit stalemate it finds itself in.
830821478	22	The decision to delay Brexit came after a week of humiliation for the prime minister—a feeling she must be used to by now.
830821478	23	Lawmakers rejected her deal for a second time on Tuesday night in a defeat which was only marginally better than in January when it suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.
830821478	24	Then, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted against the U.K. ever leaving the EU without a deal.
830821478	25	Although that vote wasn’t legally binding, it was another crushing government defeat which some of her own ministers decided to abstain on.
830821478	26	May’s misery wasn’t helped by Donald Trump on Thursday when he said he was “surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations” and criticized the prime minister because she didn't listen to his advice on Brexit, commenting: “It could have been negotiated in a different manner.” May revealed in July last year that Trump told her, in typical Trump fashion, the best way forward would be to sue the EU.Asked if he thinks the Brexit deadline should be extended, Trump said: “I think they are probably going to have to do something, because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that.”
830821478	27	However, the president warned against a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying it would be “unfair to people who have won.”
832269185	1	Brexit delay request will be rejected if no guarantees of deal success – France’s Le Drian
832269185	3	Britain’s request for a Brexit delay will be turned down by the EU if Prime Minister Theresa May cannot provide sufficient guarantees that the British parliament will approve the negotiated divorce, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
832269185	4	The minister told France’s parliament that May would need to make her case at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday, Reuters reports.
832269185	5	“A situation in which Mrs May would not be able to present to the European Council sufficient guaranties about the credibility of her strategy would lead to the extension request being dismissed and opting for a no-deal exit,” Le Drian said.
832269185	6	All remaining EU 27 members must agree on any extension.
832918490	1	Adam Schiff Threatens to Subpoena Mueller After Russia Probe Wraps
832918490	3	Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that his panel will subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if more details regarding his report on possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia is required.
832918490	4	“If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee,” Schiff told CNN host Wolf Blitzer, adding that the House Judiciary Committee could request Attorney General Bill Barr testify on the report’s findings, as well.
832918490	5	Mueller delivered his report to Barr on Friday and said that he could brief Congressional leaders on its findings as early as this weekend.
832918490	6	Schiff continued:
832918490	7	At the end of the day, the (Justice) department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
832918490	8	And it’s hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
832918490	9	This began as a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI.
832918490	10	It began as the same in our committee, and we have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.
832918490	11	The California Democrat made no mention whether Mueller’s possible testimony would be public or closed-door.
832920387	1	Mueller's Investigation Lasted 674 Days.
832920387	2	Here's How That Compares to Other Probes
832920387	4	Longer than Watergate, but much shorter than Iran-Contra or Whitewater.
832920387	5	That’s how Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation stacks up compared to other independent probes by the Justice Department.
832920387	6	The investigation concluded Friday when Mueller sent a final report to Attorney General William Barr — 674 days after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed him as special counsel to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
832920387	7	(The final number may be a few days longer, as a Mueller spokesman said staffers will stick around to close up shop.)
832920387	8	The next phase will begin shortly, as the Department of Justice, the White House and Congress hash out how much of the report to make public.
832920387	9	“I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr wrote in a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

832920387	12	Given the complexity of Mueller’s investigation, which resulted in the indictment, conviction or guilty plea from 34 people and three companies plus several other investigations referred to career prosecutors, the probe moved swiftly.
832920387	13	But it was also much shorter than some other notable probes by special counsels and special prosecutors in the past.Here’s how the length of Mueller’s probe compares to previous investigations.
832920387	14	Watergate: 155 days
832920387	15	Five men were arrested while trying to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972, but it took several months before the Washington Post confirmed that break-in was linked to President Richard Nixon.
832920387	16	A special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was not appointed to investigate Nixon’s involvement until May 18, 1973.
832920387	17	On October 20, 1973, Nixon was successful in requesting the Acting Attorney General to fire Cox, after both the previous attorney general and deputy attorney general refused and resigned.
832920387	18	Cox’s investigation lasted 155 days.
832920387	19	Nixon resigned nine months later, on Aug. 9, 1974.
832920387	20	Waco: 316 days
832920387	21	In February 1993, federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives raided a Branch Davidian religious compound near Waco, Texas, after the agency heard reports that the Christian cult, under the leadership of David Koresh, had stockpiled  illegal firearms and explosives.A 51-day standoff resulted in a violent gun battle that led to 76 deaths, including more than two dozen children.
832920387	22	The FBI did not believe Koresh when he said he and his followers would come out eventually, and so the FBI deposited containers of gas in the compound on April 19, 1993.
832920387	23	Next, gunfire and flames seemed to break out simultaneously, and firefighters could not enter the compound.
832920387	24	On Sept. 9, 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno named former Sen. John Danforth as special counsel to head a review of what happened in 1993, after the FBI uncovered information suggesting “incendiary or pyrotechnic devices may have been used.” On July 21, 2000, Danforth released findings that concluded federal agents did not fire shots at members of the religious group, nor did they start the deadly fire.
832920387	25	His investigation lasted 316 days.
832920387	26	The Starr Report: 1,693 days
832920387	27	In January 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske Jr. as the independent counsel in charge of investigating financial irregularities at Whitewater Development Corp., an investment that Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved with.
832920387	28	In August 1994, Kenneth Starr replaced Fiske as independent counsel.
832920387	29	Reno approved Starr’s request to expand his investigation to include Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in January 1998.
832920387	30	Eight months later, on September 9, 1998, Starr released a report to Congress outlining 11 possible grounds for impeachment.
832920387	31	Two days later, the report was made public.
832920387	32	Between Fiske’s appointment and Starr’s release of his report to Congress, 1,693 days passed.
832920387	33	Ultimately, in February 1999, the Senate acquitted President Clinton of the two articles of impeachment he faced: perjury and obstruction of justice.
832920387	34	Iran-Contra: 2,420 days
832920387	35	Around 1986, President Ronald Reagan’s administration sold arms to Iran, which was at war with Iraq.
832920387	36	In exchange for the weapons, Iran was supposed to help the United States procure the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
832920387	37	Profits from the deal then went to “contras,” rebel groups who were fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua at the time.
832920387	38	The United States was not supposed to sell weapons to Iran or pay ransoms, so Attorney General Edwin Meese III requested that an independent prosecutor be appointed.
832920387	39	On Dec. 19, 1986, a panel of judges appointed Lawrence Walsh.
832920387	40	The Department of Justice confirmed that appointment a few months later.
832920387	41	Walsh’s investigation lasted approximately eight years and resulted in charges against 14 people.
832920387	42	He submitted his final report to the U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 4, 1993, meaning his probe lasted about 2,420 days.

832926076	10	While her husband is under intense scrutiny, all eyes were on Melania during the photo call.
832926076	11	Melania wore a linen silk dress from UK brand LK Bennett featuring distracting bold orange, white and black Aztec-inspired prints.
832926076	12	The cinched-in-at-the-waist 'Andrea' round-neck occasion dress is currently on sale for $282.50, down from $565.
832926076	13	Melania paired the midi-length half price frock with Christian Louboutin heels.
832926076	14	The First Lady had a breezy attitude as she took to social media to speak about her day with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Haiti President Jovenel Moise, Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet, Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, and Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.
832926076	15	'Enjoyed hosting the leaders & their delegations,' she posted on Twitter about the day at West Palm Beach.

832926076	19	Earlier Trump had shared a video on Twitter from inside his meeting.
832926076	20	Making no mention of the Mueller report, he posted: 'Today in Florida, @FLOTUS and I were honored to welcome and meet with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia!'
832926076	21	He arrived on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport waving to supporters.
832926076	22	Late on Friday Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News: 'This marks the end of the Russia investigation.
832926076	23	We await a disclosure of the facts.
832926076	24	We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscores what the president has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong.'

832926076	33	'Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department's long-standing practices and policies,' he added Friday.
832926076	34	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement: 'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.
832926076	35	'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.'

832931332	1	What happens after no one goes to jail?
832931332	3	Our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom
832931332	4	What happens after no one goes to jail?
832931332	5	And so, the Mueller Investigation into the alleged Trump-Russian Collusion to fix the 2016 general election against Hillary goes the way of similar investigations that have proceeded it.
832931332	6	Nowhere.
832931332	7	In the relatively recent past, we’ve watched, not in any particular order, Plamegate, Benghazi, the IRS suppression of Tea Party groups, Fast & Furious, Uranium One, and that brief puppet show that accompanied the F.B.I.
832931332	8	inquiry into classified documents found on Hillary Clinton’s private server.
832931332	9	Further back, there was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the assassination of the President of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, and his brother/advisor Ngo Dinh Nhu – twenty days before another Presidential assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.
832931332	10	And, oh, can’t forget Iran Contra and Whitewater.
832931332	11	And so, the Mueller Investigation of alleged Trump collusion with the Russians to assure his election joins the growing list.
832931332	12	Now, this evening from the Swamp, comes confirmation that, all along, there’s been no there there.
832931332	13	About half the adults in America knew as much from the get-go.
832931332	14	The intrepid, two-year running, deadly serious reports on the “investigation” coming from the breathless voices of the “news” media, supported by indignantly outraged politicians, ran the dial on our Bravo Sierra Meter into the red zone, almost daily.
832931332	15	Suppose they’ll apologize to the nation?
832931332	16	Many of us have learned from past experience how to see.
832931332	17	For example, we soon realized there was no serious inquiry into Benghazi.
832931332	18	Same for the Clinton Foundation, as well as for all the nefarious deeds related to the nation’s premier power couple.
832931332	19	We shrug—it is what it is—what can we do about it?
832931332	20	The FISA Court, created in the wake of 911, has become the means to conduct secret, unsubstantiated, investigations against political adversaries.
832931332	21	Hi ho.
832931332	22	NSA vacuuming up of a kazillion phone calls is, we’re told, for our protection and well-being.
832931332	23	Sure it is.
832931332	24	Unmasking of persons, led by the Obama administration’s U.S.
832931332	25	Ambassador to the U.N. and the Queen of Unmasking, Samantha Powers, was, well, it must have been justified, right?
832931332	26	Part of keeping us safe.
832931332	27	In the end, the important question is this: What happens when no one goes to jail?
832931332	28	After it becomes clear, even to Helen Keller were she here to witness events, that it’s all been a charade.
832931332	29	And the people indicted by Mueller et al were collateral damage in what the President has long called a “Witch Hunt.” Like a Salem Witch, it was him they meant to burn alive.
832931332	30	And don’t think they won’t keep trying, even though this episode has come to a flat end.
832931332	31	Even on this evening, March 22, 2019, it’s clear that liberals on virtually all the major networks, including FOX, will say, “Well, yea, but it’s not over yet.
832931332	32	There’s still…and…bla bla bla.” Breathe deep, and sip wine to stomach it all.
832931332	33	We wonder, a lot of us: Has government corruption always been a constant in the Swamp?
832931332	34	Of course, it has.
832931332	35	But does it seem to be escalating in its frequency and intensity?
832931332	36	Yes, it does.
832931332	37	And in other cases, both mentioned above and unlisted, what happens when none of those who plan, execute, and benefit from the corruption—what happens when not one of them go to jail?
832931332	38	Or, are in any meaningful way, otherwise held accountable?
832931332	39	We should assume these two things will happen.
832931332	40	First, our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom.
832931332	41	Until, eventually, we will lose the right to claim it.
832931332	42	And the second thing to happen will be this: The corruption will continue to replicate itself and get worse.
832931332	43	In the days ahead, we will be repeatedly reminded that Robert Mueller III is a man of stellar integrity, heralded by those in the Swamp as a fearless crime fighter, a former Marine hero in Vietnam.
832931332	44	I have a friend from college who was a genuine gun fighter.
832931332	45	He joined the Corps as a Private—came out a Major, with a Silver Star.
832931332	46	He’s featured in a book about the legendary First Marine Recon in Vietnam.
832931332	47	He’s alive and well today.
832931332	48	In my high school band, I sat next to a small, Hispanic kid.
832931332	49	Once out of school, he joined the Marine Corps, and went to Vietnam.

832933796	3	President Donald Trump’s advisers feel upbeat that special counsel Robert Mueller “doesn’t have the goods” to formally accuse the president of colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election or charge that he obstructed justice, according to the Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig.
832933796	4	The comprehensive report, still confidential, marks the end of Mueller’s probe but sets the stage for big public fights to come.
832933796	5	The next steps are up to Attorney General William Barr, to Congress and, in all likelihood, federal courts.
832933796	6	The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
832933796	7	Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be released publicly before long and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
832933796	8	President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery was that he is “glad it’s over,” according to sources close to ABC News.
832933796	9	Barr released a letter noting his plans to write his own account of Mueller’s findings.
832933796	10	The White House released a statement saying it had not seen or been briefed on the special counsel’s document.
832933796	11	What happens next is “up to Attorney General Barr,” said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
832933796	12	Barr said he could send his account to Congress quickly.
832933796	13	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr said in his letter to top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.
832933796	14	He pledged a commitment to transparency.
832933796	15	The attorney general said the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to Congress to ensure there was no political inference in the independent probe.

832934428	3	Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) seemed to push aside special counsel Robert Mueller report pointing to “other entities” investigating the Trump Organizations.
832934428	4	Hirono said, “This is the way I look at it.
832934428	5	This is the end of the beginning.

832934428	7	So there’s more to come.
832934428	8	I think the president should be concerned.”
832934428	9	She added, “And if we look at his tweets of late where he has been all over the place with regard to Golan Heights and North Korea and all of that.
832934428	10	It seems like the president is very concerned in spite of saying, Oh the Mueller report, I don’t know about that.

832940138	3	President Donald Trump gives the thumbs-up as he arrives on Air Force One on March 22 at Palm Beach International Airport, en route to Mar-a-Lago.
832940138	4	By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Robert Mueller or Russia.| AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster White House Trump faces Mueller report in Mar-a-Lago bubble he president kicked off a weekend at Mar-a-Lago with a speech at a fundraising dinner but few words about special counsel Robert Mueller.
832940138	5	PALM BEACH, Florida –When the news finally broke that Robert Mueller had completed his investigation, President Donald Trump was cloistered in the safe space of his private club here, surrounded by senior aides and the diehard supporters who pay big bucks to catch a glimpse of him..
832940138	6	As Washington melted down over the long-awaited news 1,000 miles away, the fierce Trump defenders here girded for an epic battle.
832940138	7	Story Continued Below“He seems to be able to deal with most of the stuff that most people can’t.
832940138	8	I am convinced that he can weather anything he’s put through,”” said Joyce Lewis Bass, a board member of the Boca Raton Regional Republican Club.
832940138	9	On Friday night, just feet from where Trump and his family were having dinner, local Republicans were holding a fundraising dinner.
832940138	10	The logo for the event: a five-dollar bill featuring a MAGA-hat clad Abraham Lincoln.
832940138	11	Organizers had held out hope that Trump would make an appearance at the event, and White House officials initially signaled he wouldn't attend, saying he planned to spend his night on Mar-a-Lago’s patio with First Lady Melania Trump, their son Barron, and Melania Trump’s parents.
832940138	12	poster="http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201903/3951/1155968404_6013529254001_6013519949001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404" true
832940138	13	But Trump couldn't resist.
832940138	14	The president spoke to the cheering crowd for about two minutes, with the first lady standing beside him on stage, according to a video of his remarks obtained by POLITICO.
832940138	15	He said nothing about the Mueller news.
832940138	16	Instead, he thanked “the legendary Pam Bondi,” Florida’s former attorney general who was honored at the dinner, and marveled at the first lady’s poll numbers.
832940138	17	The president also cracked a joke about the keynote speaker, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
832940138	18	“If Lindsey’s speaking, I want to come down here,” Trump said, “for two reasons.
832940138	19	No.
832940138	20	1: he’s a great speaker.
832940138	21	And No.
832940138	22	2, I know if I’m here, he’s not going to say anything bad about me.”
832940138	23	The dinner capped another whirlwind day for Trump.
832940138	24	As they braced for the report throughout the day Friday, Trump and his team tried to convey an image of a president putting his head down and focusing on the job. Aides arranged a meeting with the leaders of five Caribbean countries, the president announced his pick to join the Federal Reserve and he bragged about the defeat of the Islamic State.But Trump quickly overshadowed those efforts, issuing a confusing tweet that implied he was undoing North Korea sanctions that his administration had just put in place.
832940138	25	The tweet caught many in the White House by surprise and the administration later tried to clarify, insisting he was referring instead to not-yet-imposed sanctions.

832940138	29	Trump’s Islamic State victory lap was also quickly undercut.
832940138	30	At the end of the flight to Florida, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders entered Air Force One’s press cabin wielding a map.
832940138	31	ISIS no longer holds any territory in Syria, she declared, without offering any other details.
832940138	32	Trump later held up the same map, at one point displaying it upside down, boasting about his success in diminishing the terrorist group.
832940138	33	“So here is ISIS on Election Day.
832940138	34	Here's ISIS right now,” he said.
832940138	35	The only problem: the graphic didn’t compare ISIS’s current territory to Election Day in 2016.
832940138	36	According to photographs captured by reporters, it compared the territory to 2014, undercutting the president’s about turning things around immediately after taking office.
832940138	37	“You guys can have the map.
832940138	38	Congratulations.
832940138	39	You’ll spread it around,” Trump told reporters, handing them the document.
832940138	40	Sanders quickly snatched up the paper.
832940138	41	Trump tried to project calm throughout the day, distancing himself from the image of a man about to suffer a political blow.
832940138	42	On his arrival at the airport here, he delighted in the adoration of his supporters, signing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.
832940138	43	But there were more subtle signs that the White House — like all of Washington — had assumed crash position ahead of the transmittal of Mueller’s report to Attorney General Bill Barr, which happened at 5pm, shortly after a sudden blinding hailstorm tore through an already-anxious capital: White House counsel Pat Cipollone joined the president at Mar-a-Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter, as did Sanders, who doesn’t always travel with the president on weekend trips.
832940138	44	“We'll see what happens,” Trump had said early in the day as he departed for his weekend in Florida.
832940138	45	“There was no collusion.
832940138	46	There was no obstruction,” he repeated once again.
832940138	47	“Everybody knows it.
832940138	48	It's all a big hoax.
832940138	49	It's all a witch hunt.”
832940138	50	But he didn’t mention Mueller for the rest of the day.
832940138	51	Though the president is often eager to field reporters’ questions, he ignored journalists as he sat alongside the Caribbean leaders, under two gold and crystal chandeliers.
832940138	52	For once, it seemed, Trump felt he had nothing more to say.
832940138	53	He was content to wait.
832940138	54	By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Mueller or Russia.
832940138	55	Friday's fundraising dinner was hosted by the Palm Beach County Republicans.
832940138	56	Tickets for the fundraiser started at $375, with sponsorship packages going as high as $25,000.
832940138	57	On Friday afternoon, a person helping to organize the dinner predicted Trump would attend, especially given that the event was held just feet from the room where Trump huddled with the Caribbean leaders.
832940138	58	“We very much expect the president to come,” the person said.
832940138	59	“It’s in his house.”
832940138	60	The mood at Mar-a-Lago Friday afternoon was low-key, despite the furor over the Mueller developments swirling in Washington.
832940138	61	A nearby parking lot was packed with luxury cars, including a bright yellow Porsche and a chrome Rolls Royce.
832940138	62	A woman in the parking lot sported a black fur coat in the nearly 75-degree weather.
832940138	63	Mueller’s actual conclusions remain under lock and key at the Justice Department.
832940138	64	But supporters here seemed unfazed by the report’s imminent disclosure.
832940138	65	Asked if she’s certain the president can overcome the Mueller probe’s findings, Toni Holt Kramer, a Mar-a-Lago member and founder of the Trumpettes USA, a Trump fan club, said via email, “Positive!!

832941978	1	Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over
832941978	3	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has said that he believes there will likely be further indictments from Robert Mueller as the full contents of his report are looked at in closer detail.
832941978	4	Schiff suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is contained in the long-awaited document.
832941978	5	'If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,' the California Democrat said during an interview Friday on CNN.
832941978	6	Scroll down for video
832941978	7	House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said Friday that he's willing to subpoena Robert Mueller and Attorney General Barr, if needed, to push for disclosure
832941978	8	'At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
832941978	9	And it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
832941978	10	'We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.'
832941978	11	Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to AG William Barr Friday afternoon
832941978	12	Schiff was asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would be satisfied if 'the most sensitive information' obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called 'gang of eight'.
832941978	13	'No, it would not suffice.
832941978	14	Now, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but the volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.
832941978	15	'We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.'
832941978	16	In another interview with MSNBC, Schiff said that it is entirely likely that more indictments could be forthcoming, saying instead it is 'entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be' more.
832941978	17	'Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,' he said.
832941978	18	'It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments.
832941978	19	'In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.
832941978	20	'Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.'
832941978	21	How the news broke: This is the letter Bill Barr, the attorney general, sent to the chairs and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees, revealing the Mueller probe is over
832941978	22	Though Trump himself has said the report should be made public, it's not clear whether the administration would fight subpoenas for testimony or block the transmission of grand jury material.
832941978	23	If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena.
832941978	24	A court fight could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court.
832941978	25	But few tussles between Congress and the White House get that far.
832941978	26	They often are resolved through negotiation.
832941978	27	The Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, could also formally ask Mueller to send his committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump, as suggested by Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.
832941978	28	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding to see the full Mueller report immediately
832941978	29	'There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr' shouldn't release the full report, said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
832941978	30	With Attorney General William Barr vowing to rush out information on the report's 'principal conclusions' as soon as this weekend, Democrats were insisting they see both the complete document and the evidence in its entirety.
832941978	31	'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.
832941978	32	'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,' the leaders said.
832941978	33	'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	34	The watchword is transparency,' they said.
832941978	35	President Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, in Washington
832941978	36	Speaking to reporters Friday, Schumer said: 'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	37	The watchword is transparency.'
832941978	38	He added: 'The president himself has called without qualification or the report to be made public.
832941978	39	There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr should do any less.'
832941978	40	Schumer predicted the effort ultimately would prevail due to public sentiment.
832941978	41	'The demand of the public is overwhelming to see the report when it's on such a serious matter and it will be made public.
832941978	42	Public pressure will force it to be,' he said.
832941978	43	Barr himself pledged transparency during his Senate confirmation hearing.
832941978	44	But the strong defender of presidential power also left open the possibility he would share his own summary, rather than the report itself, to Congress – a move that would provoke a fight with the Democratic House.
832941978	45	Although there were reports Mueller would bring no additional indictments, there remained the possibility of indictments already sealed, or that another body such as the Southern District of New York wold bring indictments.
832941978	46	Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told MSNBC there was a 'high probability' that could happen.
832941978	47	'I think there is a strong possibility of additional indictments, including president Trump's family,' Blumenthal said Friday evening.
832941978	48	'Maybe not by the Department of Justice, main Justice.
832941978	49	But by other offices.
832941978	50	I know that you want to stick to the Mueller report.
832941978	51	But the Mueller report cannot be viewed in isolation,' the former prosecutor and Trump nemesis continued.
832941978	52	'Any more than an investigation, even though it may end, cannot lead to additional investigative leads and actions.
832941978	53	And so I think there's a high probability of additional indictments.'
832941978	54	With the White House already resisting document requests from the Democratic Congress, lawmakers want to get hold of Mueller's work product and use it as the basis for additional investigation.
832941978	55	Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary panels, bluntly told CNN Friday afternoon: 'We want the full report.
832941978	56	We want it now.
832941978	57	We want it before the president is able to get it or make any edits.'
832941978	58	Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who is ramping up his own investigations
832941978	59	The president is a subject.
832941978	60	He's a subject of the investigation.
832941978	61	He has an inherent conflict of interest,' Swalwell continued.
832941978	62	'It's really inappropriate that he would even touch this.
832941978	63	IF he didn't do anything wrong, he would keep his hands off it.'
832941978	64	Sand Senate Intelligence Committee Co-chair Democrat Mark Warner: 'Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts of the Mueller report for themselves.
832941978	65	It must be provided to Congress immediately, and the AG should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
832941978	66	Nothing short of that will suffice.'
832941978	67	Warner added on Twitter: 'Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.'
832941978	68	House Judiciary ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia, joined the call for the release of the Mueller report.
832941978	69	'After nearly two years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, and I look forward to reviewing Attorney General Barr's report carefully, when it becomes available.
832941978	70	I fully expect the Justice Department to release the special counsel's report to this committee and to the public without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,' Collins said.
832941978	71	'We want the full report.
832941978	72	We want it now,' said Rep. Eric Swalwell of California
832941978	73	Special Counsel Robert Muller arrives at his office building, Thursday, March 21, 2019, in Washington
832941978	74	Barr told key lawmakers: 'I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,' he wrote.
832941978	75	That raised the possibility that he would provide a mere summary of Mueller's findings, which could leave information that didn't result in charges out of the matter.
832941978	76	Trump said that he would have no objection to the public release of Mueller's findings – although he was not specific as to what he would see released.
832941978	77	'I don't mind,' he said.
832941978	78	'Let it come out,' Trump declared.
832941978	79	'Let people see it.'
832941978	80	And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the public via Twitter Friday afternoon: 'The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.'
832947554	1	Tom Steyer Rallies Supporters after Conclusion of Mueller Report
832947554	3	Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer issued a video on Friday rallying supporters after the lackluster conclusion of the report issued by special counsel Robert Mueller.
832947554	4	Mueller’s report did not include any additional criminal indictments, despite leftists dreaming that President Donald Trump or members of his family would be sent to jail as a result of the investigation.
832947554	5	Steyer called for “perspective,” reminding them that Mueller already indicted people connected to Trump such as Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.
832947554	6	“It has already led to the indictment of 34 individuals,” Steyer said, leaving out the fact that 26 of them were Russians as well as three Russian companies.
832947554	7	He reminded supporters that the Mueller report had sparked other investigations into “Mr.
832947554	8	Trump’s criminality.”
832947554	9	Steyer called for Attorney General William Barr to do a full release of the report.
832947554	10	He urged supporters to cling to the idea that Trump already “participated in crimes” while in the presidency.

832947600	1	Grassley: Attempts to Keep Collusion Narrative Alive Will Harm U.S.
832947600	3	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Senate Finance Committee chairman, declared the Russian collusion narrative dead on Friday, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to Attorney General William Barr, with no further indictments planned.
832947600	4	“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries,” the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee said in a statement.He also noted that Mueller has been investigating any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin for “nearly two years now,” and the Justice Department even before the 2016 election.
832947600	5	He also slammed the “millions” in taxpayer dollars and “aggressive surveillance tools” used, with still no evidence of collusion.
832947600	6	“We know that the Russians tried to meddle in our democratic processes to sow divisions, as they have in so many other countries.
832947600	7	But throughout this prolonged investigation, which cost tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and included aggressive surveillance tools, we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion,” he said.
832947600	8	Grassley joined fellow members of Congress in asking for Mueller’s findings to be released, to “finally put an end” to the “speculation and innuendo” that has plagued the administration since its inauguration.
832947600	9	“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
832947600	10	Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.
832947852	1	Top 10 Propagandists Who Pushed Russia Collusion Hoax
832947852	3	Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his final report to Attorney General William Barr, marking the official end of the investigation — and with no further indictments on the way.
832947852	4	Although it is not yet known what is in the report, and it could still contain information damaging to the administration, the revelation that there will be no new indictments suggests that the Russia collusion theory is a bust.
832947852	5	Yet since the summer of 2016, there were countless pushers of the narrative that President Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, specifically by conspiring with Russia to steal and distribute stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
832947852	6	This included anonymous current and former officials and those in the media willing to publish their allegations, friends of those officials, Democrat members of Congress, those wanting to promote themselves, and of course, Clinton and her campaign officials.
832947852	7	Here are ten of the top promoters of the narrative:
832947852	8	CNN — CNN first reported that President Trump was briefed on the “pee dossier,” which prompted BuzzFeed to publish the dossier in full.
832947852	9	CNN has also given vast amounts of airtime to analysts, former officials, and Democrat lawmakers pushing the Russia collusion narrative.
832947852	10	It has also published a number of stories that advanced the narrative, including several that turned out to be false.
832947852	11	BuzzFeed — BuzzFeed first published the “pee dossier” in full — which released to the public unfounded accusations against President Trump, including the unverified claim that he hired prostitutes to urinate on a bed during a visit to Moscow in 2013.
832947852	12	At the time of publish, the dossier remained “salacious and unverified,” in then-FBI Director James Comey’s own words.
832947852	13	The Washington Post — The Washington Post was on the forefront of publishing anonymously-sourced stories suggesting collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials.
832947852	14	It published the intelligence leak that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak that led to his firing later.
832947852	15	Flynn ended up pleading guilty to one count of lying.
832947852	16	There were no collusion charges.
832947852	17	The New York Times — The New York Times published a front-page, top-of-the-page story on Inauguration Day suggesting that President-elect Trump’s associates had been “wiretapped.” Though the report admitted, “It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself,” it set the very inauguration of President Trump as part of a Russian conspiracy.
832947852	18	Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) — Schiff, now the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been the No.
832947852	19	1 pusher of the Russia collusion hoax in Congress.
832947852	20	Absent any direct evidence of collusion, Schiff has argued for months that the evidence is “hiding in plain sight.” Schiff has also tried to fundraise off of the hoax.
832947852	21	Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) — Lieu has been a close second to Schiff’s promotion of the Russia hoax in Congress.
832947852	22	He once called for a pause in the “entire Trump agenda” until an investigation into the collusion ties was completed.
832947852	23	Benjamin Wittes — Wittes, a journalist who is close to former FBI Director James Comey, was a lead inciter on Twitter of the Russia hoax, infamously tweeting cannon gifs every time a new sensational report came out that advanced the Russia collusion narrative.
832947852	24	Louise Mensch — Mensch, a former British parliamentarian, has become a household name among the anti-Trump resistance in the U.S., with her fantastical tweets about “sealed indictments” and grand juries.
832947852	25	Hillary Clinton — Clinton, the day after losing the election to Trump, wanted to promote the idea that Comey’s reopening of the investigation into her emails and Russia led to her defeat, according to the book Shattered.
832947852	26	“She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” a Clinton ally told the book’s authors.
832947852	27	Robby Mook — Mook was the first Clinton campaign official to go on record suggesting there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, during an ABC News interview at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, shortly after stolen DNC emails were released.

832948083	3	Mueller concludes Russia-Trump probe; lawmakers urge immediate release
832948083	4	WASHINGTON: Special counsel Robert Mueller closed his long and contentious Russia investigation with no new charges Friday, ending the probe that has cast a dark shadow over Donald Trump’s presidency but launching a fresh wave of political battles over the still-confidential findings.
832948083	5	The report’s details remained a mystery, accessible to only a handful of Justice Department officials while Attorney General William Barr prepared to release the “principal findings” soon.
832948083	6	But the closure of the 22-month probe without additional indictments by Mueller was welcome news to some in Trump’s orbit who had feared a final round of charges could ensnare more Trump associates, including members of the president’s family.
832948083	7	The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
832948083	8	Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
832948083	9	The next step is up to Barr, who is charged with writing his own account of Mueller’s findings and sending it to Congress.
832948083	10	In a letter to lawmakers , he declared he was committed to transparency and speed.
832948083	11	He said he could provide details as soon as this weekend.
832948083	12	The White House sought to keep some distance from the report, saying it had not seen or been briefed on the document.
832948083	13	Trump, surrounded by advisers and political supporters at his resort in Florida, stayed uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter.
832948083	14	With no details released at this point, it’s not known whether Mueller’s report answers the core questions of his investigation: Did Trump’s campaign collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of the celebrity businessman?
832948083	15	Also, did Trump take steps later, including by firing his FBI director, to obstruct the probe?
832948083	16	But the delivery of the report does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, or of obstruction by the president.
832948083	17	A Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments.
832948083	18	That person, who described the document as “comprehensive,” was not authorized to discuss the probe and asked for anonymity.

832948083	22	That’s good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
832948083	23	They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller’s prosecutors.
832948083	24	It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mueller might have referred additional investigations to the Justice Department.
832948083	25	All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies.
832948083	26	Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the Internet.
832948083	27	Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
832948083	28	It’s unclear what steps Mueller might take if he uncovered what he believes to be criminal wrongdoing by Trump, in light of Justice Department legal opinions that have held that sitting presidents may not be indicted.
832948083	29	In his letter to lawmakers, Barr noted the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to ensure there was no political inference.
832948083	30	Trump was never interviewed in person, but submitted answers to questions in writing.
832948083	31	The mere delivery of the confidential findings set off swift, full-throated demands from Democrats for full release of Mueller’s report and the supporting evidence collected during the sweeping probe.
832948083	32	As Mueller’s probe has wound down, Democrats have increasingly shifted their focus to their own investigations, ensuring the special counsel’s would not be the last word on the matter.
832948083	33	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it “imperative” to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
832948083	34	“The American people have a right to the truth,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
832948083	35	Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a “sneak preview” of the findings.
832948083	36	“The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,” they said in a joint statement.
832948083	37	It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller’s findings.
832948083	38	Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying “we look forward to the process taking its course.” But Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get “an early look” before they were made public.
832948083	39	Giuliani said it was “appropriate” for the White House to be able “to review matters of executive privilege.” He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
832948083	40	He later softened his stance, saying the decision was “up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.”
832948083	41	The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report’s arrival Friday.
832948083	42	Barr’s chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
832948083	44	The chairman of the Senate panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was keynote speaker Friday night at a Palm Beach County GOP dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.
832948083	45	Early in the evening, the president appeared on a balcony to wave at the crowd of more than 600 enjoying cocktails and appetizers by the pool, according to party vice-chairwoman Tami Donnally, who attended the event.
832948083	46	Barr has said he wants to make as much public as possible, but any efforts to withhold details is sure to prompt a tussle between the Justice Department and lawmakers who may subpoena Mueller and his investigators to testify before Congress.
832948083	47	Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, threatened a subpoena Friday.
832948083	48	Such a move would likely be vigorously contested by the Trump administration.
832948083	49	The conclusion of Mueller’s investigation does not remove legal peril for the president .
832948083	50	Trump faces a separate Justice Department investigation in New York into hush money payments during the campaign to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election.
832948083	51	He’s also been implicated in a potential campaign finance violation by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the transactions.
832948083	52	Federal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions made to the president’s inaugural committee.
832948083	53	No matter the findings in Mueller’s report, the investigation has already illuminated Russia’s assault on the American political system, painted the Trump campaign as eager to exploit the release of hacked Democratic emails and exposed lies by Trump aides aimed at covering up their Russia-related contacts.
832948083	54	The special counsel brought a sweeping indictment accusing Russian military intelligence officers of hacking Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other Democratic groups during the 2016 campaign.
832948083	55	He charged another group of Russians with carrying out a large-scale social media disinformation campaign against the American political process that also sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.
832948083	56	Mueller also initiated the investigation into Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, who pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations arising from the hush money payments and in the Mueller probe to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal.
832948083	57	Another Trump confidant, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails ultimately released by WikiLeaks.
832948083	58	Mueller has also been investigating whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation.
832948083	59	Since the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017, Trump has increasingly tried to undermine the probe by calling it a “witch hunt” and repeatedly proclaiming there was “NO COLLUSION” with Russia.
832948083	60	But one week before Mueller’s appointment, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, later saying he was thinking of “this Russia thing” at the time.
832956618	1	Mueller Is Done, but the Trump Investigations Are Just Heating Up
832956618	3	The Russia investigation is over.
832956618	4	Or is it?
832956618	5	Attorney General William Barr has notified Congress that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has “concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,” as required under Justice Department regulations.
832956618	6	Mueller has submitted to Barr a confidential report of “prosecution or declination decisions he has reached,” and Barr has promised to review the report and advise Congress of Mueller’s “principal conclusions” as soon as this weekend.
832956618	7	Barr further stated that he would determine whether other information can be released to Congress and the public, committing to “as much transparency as possible.”
832956618	8	So what comes next?
832956618	9	It appears that Mueller and a small staff will close up shop in the near future.
832956618	10	But that does not mean that the investigation into President Donald Trump is over.
832956618	11	Depending on the contents of Mueller’s report, Congress may have some work to do.
832956618	12	Mueller’s original mandate required him to comply with all policies of the Justice Department.
832956618	13	It seems likely, then, that he would adhere to the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
832956618	14	If so, then even if Mueller found evidence of conspiracy between Trump and Russia to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of elections (sometimes referred to as “collusion”), he would refrain from filing an indictment, and instead provide his findings to members of Congress for them to consider whether impeachment is appropriate.
832956618	15	If that is the case, then Congress’s work will just be beginning.
832956618	16	Other prosecutors may also have more work to do.
832956618	17	During the course of his investigation, Mueller has kept a narrow focus on his own mission and farmed out related cases to at least four U.S. Attorney’s Offices.
832956618	18	Those investigations remain ongoing.
832956618	19	It is possible that Mueller has handed off additional investigations in which charges have not yet been filed, and so would be unknown to the public.
832956618	20	For example, the investigation of fraud and campaign finance violations against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed off to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
832956618	21	Cohen pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to three years in prison, but it appears that work on that case continues.
832956618	22	Earlier this week, a judge approved the release of redacted search warrants in the Cohen case, permitting prosecutors to keep more than 18 pages of text from public disclosure.
832956618	23	The redacted pages appeared under the heading “Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme.” The court stated that redaction was necessary because “disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.” This language suggests that the work of SDNY is far from over.
832956618	24	Subjects of the investigation could include Donald Trump, Jr., who reportedly signed at least one of the checks that were provided to Cohen as reimbursement for his illegal payments to silence woman from publicly accusing Trump of extramarital affairs .
832956618	25	Reports have indicated that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, has received immunity in exchange for his cooperation.
832956618	26	Even if Mueller’s work is done, the work of the SDNY continues.
832956618	27	In addition to SDNY, other U.S. Attorney’s Offices are also known to be working on matters that arose from Mueller’s work.
832956618	28	In December, the Eastern District of Virginia charged two associates of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with conspiring to act as agents of a foreign government and related charges.
832956618	29	In that case, Flynn’s former business partner Bijan Kian and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim were charged with agreeing to lobby U.S. officials and influence public opinion against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
832956618	30	The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is handling the pending case against Roger Stone for lying to Congress, making false statements and tampering with witnesses.
832956618	31	That case is set for trial in November.
832956618	32	If Stone should decide to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others, prosecutors would follow those leads as well.
832956618	33	In addition, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Columbia has been handling cases against Sam Patten and Maria Butina , respectively .
832956618	34	Patten pleaded guilty in August to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and has agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others.
832956618	35	Patten pleaded guilty to lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party and concealing his role from the U.S. government.
832956618	36	Patten further pleaded guilty to illegally using straw purchasers to buy tickets to the Trump inauguration for a Ukrainian oligarch for $50,000.TThe law prohibits inaugural committees from accepting money from foreign nationals.Butina pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to act as an agent of Russia.She has been cooperating with the government.
832956618	37	In February, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of South Dakota indicted her boyfriend, Republican operative Paul Erickson, on wire fraud and money laundering charges.
832956618	38	These cases will continue, as will any cases that they spawn.
832956618	39	It may be a long time before the work of Mueller is really complete.
832959523	1	How Theresa May Botched
832959523	3	Those were the times…
832959523	4	The Times page 1 is of January 18, 2017.
832959523	5	Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union about Brexit were just beginning.
832959523	6	The “you’ll be crushed” arrogance in the headline characterizes the attitude the British government under May demonstrated during the talks.
832959523	7	Recently that attitude has somewhat changed.
832959523	8	This screenshot was taken about an hour ago:
832959523	9	The BBC writes: Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $12.99 Buy New $9.05 (as of 10:25 EDT - Details)
832959523	10	Theresa May has said she “sincerely hopes” the UK will leave the EU with a deal and she is still “working on” ensuring Parliament’s agreement.Arriving in Brussels, she said that she had “personal regret” over her request to delay Brexit, but said it will allow time for MPs to make a “final choice”.
832959523	11	At the EU summit the PM spoke to the other 27 leaders to try to get their backing for a delay beyond 29 March.
832959523	12	Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were “very constructive”.
832959523	13	BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 90 minutes and was asked several times what her contingency plans were if she lost the third “meaningful vote” on her deal in Parliament.
832959523	14	French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that if MPs vote down Mrs May’s EU withdrawal agreement next week, the UK will leave without a deal.
832959523	15	May asked the EU to move the hard coded March 29 Brexit date to June 30.
832959523	16	She may be given May 23, the day of EU elections, as a compromise but only if her deal passes the British parliament.
832959523	17	A no-deal crash out on March 29 would create utter chaos for months.
832959523	18	It would be catastrophic for Britain’s economy.
832959523	19	May’s withdrawal agreement was already voted down twice.
832959523	20	If it comes to a third vote in parliament it is very likely to fail again.
832959523	21	Yves Smith, who you should all read, opens her Brexit sit rep today with this:
832959523	22	We’ve been more pessimistic than most commentators about the likelihood of the UK escaping the default of a no-deal Brexit.
832959523	23	We may not have been pessimistic enough.
832959523	24	There is still the possibility that May takes a 180 degree turn, but that would be the end of her career and likely also the end of the Conservative Party:
832959523	25	Now there is a popular push for an Article 50 revocation, with a petition already at over 400,000 signatures as of this hour.
832959523	26	But as we’ll discuss, May would have to do a complete reversal to revoke Article 50, which is within her power, not just a Prime Minister, but also implementing the motion by Parliament rejecting a no-deal Brexit.
832959523	27	Article 50 is the part of the British withdrawal law that governs the Brexit process.
832959523	28	If May revokes it, there is little chance that another Brexit attempt will ever be made.
832959523	29	The majority that voted to leave the EU will have been betrayed.
832959523	30	An analysis by the BBC Europe editor says that the “Leaders want to avoid no-deal Brexit”:
832959523	31	[W]hile EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the “backstop” text, you can bet they’ll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today.
832959523	32	This is, in my view, a misjudgment.
832959523	33	Yes, under normal circumstances and with a competent and trustworthy negotiation partner on the British side, ways would be found to fudge the issue and to avoid a Brexit in all but its name.
832959523	34	That is why I predicted long ago that Brexit was not gonna happen.
832959523	35	But May has really done everything to affront the other side of the table.
832959523	36	She did not stick to commitments she had given, delivered papers too late to properly discuss them, and came to emergency summits called on her behalf without anything new to offer.
832959523	37	Matthew Parris, a conservative political commentator in London who originally favored May, now remarks of her: Battlefield America: T... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $10.78 Buy New $19.06 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details)
832959523	38	“She is mean.
832959523	39	She is rude.
832959523	40	She is cruel.
832959523	41	She is stupid.
832959523	42	I have heard that from almost everyone who has dealt with her,” Parris says.
832959523	43	He said he had never expected this much hatred, “and that is not a word I use lightly.”
832959523	44	The leaders of other EU countries also have had it with here.
832959523	45	The voters on the continent do not care about Britain.
832959523	46	There will be no punishment for Merkel or Macron for letting Britain crash out.
832959523	47	The EU will survive without the United Kingdom.
832959523	48	With a no-deal Brexit the United Kingdom is likely to fall apart.
832959523	49	Within a few years North Ireland would join the Irish Republic, peacefully one hopes, and Scotland would vote to leave.
832959523	50	A bit of hope may still rest in this one line in the BBC report which it leaves unexplained:
832959523	51	Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were “very constructive”.
832959523	52	Is there a EU deal being made with the opposition leader and behind Theresa May’s back?
832959523	53	Given that she is the Prime Minister how would that work out?

832971448	3	The details of the long-awaited Mueller report have not been made public
832971448	4	Special counsel Robert Mueller delivered the results of his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, and the internet had a lot to say about it.
832971448	5	The details of the long-awaited Mueller report have not been made public but he has not recommended any new criminal indictments.
832971448	6	Only time will tell whether President Donald Trump will be implicated.
832971448	7	But that didn't stop meme wizards and Twitter comedians from weighing in on this historical moment.
832971448	8	From depictions of Mueller taking a much-deserved vacation, to Marie Kondo expressing joy over how much she loves a good mess, and so many jokes about procrastinating leading up to deadline, the internet was quick to poke fun on how the investigation continues to play out.

832971448	17	One meme by Twitter user @CoffeeNTrees showed Mueller's face behind cartoon sunglasses, edited onto the body former President Barach Obama on a boat wearing a life vest, from not long after he left office.
832971448	18	'Robert Mueller at 5.15 today,' the post read, implying Mueller immediately went on vacation after turning over his findings to AG Barr.
832971448	19	Another post referenced the cultural phenomenon that has become of Marie Kondo and her Netlix series, 'Tidying Up.'
832971448	20	In the show, Kondo often says she gets excited about the change to help people organize their lives, saying 'I love mess.'
832971448	21	Twitter user '@mattcasill' referenced Kondo's brand showcasing a still of her from the show saying, 'I'm so excited because I love mess,' with the caption, 'tfw [that feeling when] when the mueller report gets delivered.'

832971448	42	Trump has often referred to the Mueller probe as a 'witch hunt' so Takei ran with that.

832984694	1	‘There needs to be a reckoning’ for those who spread Russia collusion narrative: Mollie Hemingway
832984694	3	Those who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.
832984694	4	Earlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.
832984694	5	During Friday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier," Hemingway -- along with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.
832984694	6	MUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
832984694	7	Hemingway began by noting that the “Russia narrative” predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was a “Russian agent.”
832984694	8	“We have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,” Hemingway told the panel.
832984694	9	“The fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we’ve seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was ‘treasonous collusion’ to steal the 2016 election.”
832984694	10	“If there is nothing there that matches what we’ve heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,” she added.
832984694	11	"The people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government ... and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable."

832984694	14	Mason told the panel that there’s likely “some relief” in the White House, particularly from Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser.
832984694	15	And while he insisted it was “too early” to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller’s credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.
832984694	16	Meanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the “greatest anticlimax in American history,” and that the entire investigation could be “for nothing” because it was “an investigation without a crime.” He did, however, insist that the “battle will continue” as the White House will fight Congress on transparency of the Mueller findings.
833013834	1	Cable viewers digest Mueller news through Hannity, Maddow
833013834	3	For Sean Hannity, the 'witch hunt' was finally over.
833013834	4	Rachel Maddow considered it the start of something.
833013834	5	The diametrically opposed opinion hosts, who vie for the distinction of the most popular in cable news, were the windows through which many Americans digested Friday's news that special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded a nearly two-year investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election.
833013834	6	While his report, or even a summary, has not been released, television news still had hours to fill talking about it.
833013834	7	Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe.
833013834	8	Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe
833013834	9	'The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead,' Hannity said.
833013834	10	'It is buried, and there was no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.
833013834	11	The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges.'
833013834	12	He lamented that lives were ruined by the investigation and said that people who have been prosecuted or convicted had committed 'process crimes,' or crimes such as lying to investigators that stem from the very existence of the investigation.
833013834	13	The accusations against Trump were 'what we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate.'
833013834	14	Hannity's Fox colleague Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' between President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government, the purported impetus for the probe.
833013834	15	'This investigation was always, from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country.
833013834	16	They told us that for years,' Carlson said.
833013834	17	Carlson played a highlight reel of Democrats and pundits on other channels previously predicting imminent indictments of Trump and his family members.
833013834	18	None were indicted and Mueller reportedly doesn't recommend any further prosecutions.
833013834	19	'This has been a disaster.
833013834	20	How can we let the people who are responsible for it continue as if it never happened?'
833013834	21	he said, calling for the resignation of top Democrats who have pushed the collusion narrative.
833013834	22	Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' with Russia, the purported impetus for the probe
833013834	23	While Carlson suggested it was a night Americans 'should be celebrating the great news' that no crime was apparently found regarding collusion, Hannity said citizens should be outraged by the amount of time and money spent on the case.
833013834	24	He promised a reckoning in the coming weeks of politicians and media figures he claimed were guilty of a rush to judgment, and his first target was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Investigations Committee.
833013834	25	'Schifty Schiff' read the words onscreen behind him.
833013834	26	'What is Maddow and all the other MSNBC conspiracy theorists, what are they going to ever do now?'
833013834	27	he said.
833013834	28	As he talked, Maddow was doing the same.
833013834	29	Unlike most evenings, when the two figures work in studios across Manhattan's Sixth Avenue from each other, Maddow had rushed to a studio in Tennessee where she had spent the day trout fishing.
833013834	30	'Finally, it happened,' she said.
833013834	31	'In terms of what that means and what Mueller has found, we know only the smallest little bits.
833013834	32	This is the start of something, not the end of something.'
833013834	33	In meticulous fashion, she detailed how the news that Mueller's investigation had concluded was reported and what a letter by Attorney General William Barr meant about what will be released to the public.
833013834	34	Rachel Maddow waited until 16 minutes into her program to discuss the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe
833013834	35	Democrats in Congress have already demanded the full report be released and that they see background materials; Maddow read a letter by Schiff about that on the air.
833013834	36	'Right now we mostly have just a ton of questions, as to what Mueller's report says, who gets to see it, who gets to decide who gets to see it and when,' she said.
833013834	37	It wasn't until 16 minutes into her program that she discussed the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe.
833013834	38	Many Fox News Channel guests, not just Hannity, focused on that detail on Friday evening.
833013834	39	Former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski called it 'a very clear signal that this entire hoax is over.'
833013834	40	Still, some Fox personalities, including Chris Wallace and Harris Faulkner, had to caution guests that Mueller's report hadn't been seen yet.
833013834	41	'To say that somehow this clears the president seems like the height of rushing to judgment,' Wallace said.
833013834	42	He dismissed the idea that those prosecuted had been charged with process crimes, saying they were very serious.
833013834	43	Meanwhile, on CNN, analyst and frequent Trump critic Jeffrey Toobin had an answer to colleagues who warned Trump and his supporters against prematurely celebrating.
833013834	44	While he isn't necessarily in the clear, the fact that the president's sons or son-in-law Jared Kushner were not indicted 'is unambiguously good news for him,' Toobin said.
833018464	1	Do critics of Mueller owe him an apology now?
833018464	3	So, if Mueller in effect clears Trump, I expect to see a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was a dirty cop, deep state, witch hunter to suddenly discover Mueller’s integrity.
833018464	4	And a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was the Last Honest Man to vilify him as a cover up artist.
833018464	5	I don't think so.
833018464	6	The Left will not turn on him because he has made criminal referrals to the Southern District of New York, upon which the Left now pins its hopes.They also hope for the Report to indicate some dirt on Trump for which he cannot be indicted while in office, but which he may have to face after he leaves the presidency..
833018464	7	And as for conservative critics of Mueller, I will speak for myself.
833018464	8	First of all, he should never have hired Andrew Weissmann to be his lead investigator, who, it has been suggested by many, was the actual boss of the investigation, as Mueller withdrew from active, day-to-day management.
833018464	9	Weissmann had disgraced himself in the prosecution of Arthur Anderson's work for Enron, where the guilty verdicts were thrown out by the Supreme Court, after that firm had been utterly destroyed, costing thousands of people their jobs and the partners their fortunes.Second, the prosecutors included no Republican donors but many Hillary donors, and the team initially included Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose fanatic hatred for Trump, disdain for his supporters, and determination to act as an "insurance policy" in case he was elected, should have disqualified them.
833018464	10	A prosecutor interested in the truth should not assemble such a lopsided crew of fanatics..
833018464	11	Third, once it became clear that the Steele dossier — the very basis for the appointment of Mueller — was a Hillary-generated oppo research fantasy, Mueller should have announced that he would not pursue what the law calls the "fruit of a poisonous tree," resigned, and disbanded his investigation.
833018464	12	Fourth, so far as we know, though I would be delighted to learn otherwise when the Report is released, Mueller pursued no investigation of Democrats and Hillary for colluding with Russia.
833018464	13	We know that after laundering their money through the law firm of Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, a foreign intelligence agent named Christopher Steele was employed by the Hillary campaign and DNC to collude with Russian intelligence sources and influence our election.
833018464	14	So far as we know, Mueller was not told to investigate only Republicans.Fifth, the aggressive prosecutors ruined many innocent lives with the costs of lawyers, including the destruction of professional careers..
833018464	15	We now know that an abusive threat to prosecute him was made against author Jerome Corsi unless he signed a "confession" he claims was untrue.
833018464	16	Special counsel Robert Mueller's team offered Corsi a proposed plea agreement, which would have required him to admit to one criminal charge with two components: lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.
833018464	17	Corsi refused to sign the plea deal.
833018464	18	He then released drafts of his plea agreement and indictment, went on a media tour slamming Mueller's team, and published a book detailing his experiences with the special counsel.
833018464	19	In the end, Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.
833018464	20	On Friday, Corsi accused Mueller's team of trying to push him to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.
833018464	21	"I went in there to cooperate with them.
833018464	22	They treated me as a criminal," Corsi said.
833018464	23	"I consider this entire investigation to be fraudulent," he said.
833018464	24	"I'm glad it's over."
833018464	25	Because Corsi was never prosecuted, we know that this was a false threat, that there was no substantial case.
833018464	26	Had Dr. Corsi (he is a Harvard Ph.D. in history) possessed fewer resources (including especially guts), he might well have lied and given the false evidence demanded in order to spare himself the ordeal of prosecution before a District of Columbia jury composed overwhelmingly of Hillary voters, cognizant that federal prosecutors obtain guilty verdicts about 98% of the time.
833018464	27	I do commend Robert Mueller and his team for not faking enough evidence to obtain a phony indictment, but I still hold them responsible for the five types of abuses I just outlined.
833021113	1	Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi celebrates end of Mueller probe after REFUSING to sign plea deal
833021113	3	Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi has said that the end of special counsel Robert Mueller' investigation is a personal vindication, after he refused to take a plea deal under threat of prosecution.
833021113	4	With a senior Justice Department official saying that Mueller's final report submitted on Friday does not recommend further indictments, author and conspiracy theorist Corsi appears to be off the hook.
833021113	5	'I feel vindicated.
833021113	6	They offered me a plea deal which I thought was fraudulent,' Corsi said in a statement to Fox News.
833021113	7	In November, Corsi said he had refused to plead guilty to one count of perjury because he did not believe that he had committed any crime.
833021113	8	Author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi (seen in January) said that he was vindicated by the end of the Mueller probe after refusing to take a plea deal
833021113	9	'I did not knowingly and willfully give them information I knew was false,' Corsi said on Friday.
833021113	10	'The fact is I wasn't going to lie to keep myself out of prison.
833021113	11	I did nothing wrong and it is clear I did nothing wrong or they would have prosecuted me.'
833021113	12	Corsi celebrated the news in a series of triumphant tweets, writing: 'It's over but it has been the worst seven months of my life.
833021113	13	MUELLER IS DONE.
833021113	14	I am in the clear.'
833021113	15	'I want to thank all of you who have prayed for me and my family,' he added, attributing his legal outcome to the power of prayer.
833021113	16	Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, about WikiLeaks publishing stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign.
833021113	17	Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Rodger Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, who is seen above earlier this month
833021113	18	Court documents indicate that Stone sought to use him as an intermediary to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the election.
833021113	19	Stone was arrested in January in a pre-dawn raid on his home in Florida, and is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
833021113	20	He is currently free on bond and has pleaded not guilty on all counts.
833021113	21	Mueller's probe ended without any Americans being charged with conspiring with the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 election, the central allegation of the nearly two-year investigation.

833024133	3	Appearing November 5th, 2017, on MSNBC, former Gov.
833024133	4	Howard Dean (D-VT) wrongly predicted special counsel Robert Mueller would indict President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner for money laundering as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.
833024133	5	“[W]e believe we may well have a criminal in the White House,” Howard Dean told host Keir Simmons.“Certainly, he has a special interest in the Trump family and their investments.
833024133	6	And we think there is substantial likelihood that he has laundered money.
833024133	7	That’s what his associates have been charged with.
833024133	8	And so, this is a very serious matter.I don’t think this about politics, actually.”
833024133	9	Dean described Mueller as a “straight shooter” and then predicted that he would target Kushner after indicting former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his son Michael Flynn Jr.“The next step is going to be the Trump family itself,” Dean continued.
833024133	10	“I expect that there’s a good likelihood Jared Kushner will be indicted for money laundering.
833024133	11	And then we’re going to have to see how far the Russian involvement goes.
833024133	12	This is serious business.”
833024133	13	These people are undermining our democracy, he added.
833024133	14	And it appears to me what Bob Mueller is investigating is whether the president of the United States engaged with a foreign power in order to get where he got.
833024133	15	That’s a very serious matter for this country.”
833024133	16	On Friday, Mueller delivered his Russia probe report to Attorney General William Barr, who stated he will provide Congressional leaders with his account of the findings as early as the weekend.
833024133	17	A senior Justice Department official said the special counsel will not bring further indictments as part of his probe.
833024696	1	2020 Democrats Demand Mueller Report’s Public Release
833024696	3	2020 Democrat presidential candidates reacted to the Friday delivery of special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election to the Department of Justice, demanding that his findings be released immediately.
833024696	4	What the report says is confidential, however, Attorney General Bill Barr wrote in a letter to Congress that he might be able to summarize its “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend.
833024696	5	There was no indication of whether Trump himself, members of his family or former campaign advisers have been implicated in collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, two of the main focuses of the investigation that has kept a cloud over Trump’s administration since he took office.
833024696	6	Read below a round-up of several 2020 Democrat presidential candidates’ statements on the report’s submission:
833024696	7	Release the Mueller report to the American people.

833024696	35	Further, Barr stated he would consult with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, and Mueller to determine what else from the report can be released to Congress and the public.
833024696	36	“I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,” Barr said.
833024696	37	The filing of Mueller’s report came after weeks of intense speculation over whether Mueller, a former FBI director who has remained invisible while the investigation plodded ahead, would produce any indictments or evidence that would support the impeachment of Trump.A senior Justice Department official told US media Friday that after charging some 34 individuals, including six former Trump associates, Mueller’s team did not foresee recommending any further indictments..
833024696	38	Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his election campaign and Moscow, lashing out at the investigation as an “illegal witch hunt” run by a team of biased investigators.
833024696	39	The White House responded to Friday’s development by saying it welcomes the delivery of the long-awaited report.
833024696	40	“The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr and we look forward to the process taking its course,” Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
833024696	41	“The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”

833028146	1	Schiff on end of Mueller probe: 'We have to find the truth'
833028146	3	Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said about a month ago the "evidence" of Trump collusion with Russia was "in plain sight.
833028146	4	"Chairman Burr must have a different word for it," Schiff told host Dana Bash on "State of the Union," pointing to communications between Russia and Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump aides George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.
833028146	5	"You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence," Schiff said, adding, "There is a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt."
833028146	6	If there's "evidence in plain sight" for Russian collusion, then Mueller is either blind or in cahoots with Trump, because the special counsel isn't indicting anyone else.
833028146	7	But Schiff is nothing if not tenacious.
833028146	8	He is vowing to continue the investigation.
833028146	9	"We will find the truth," he told Wolf Blitzer of CNN.
833028146	10	Today, Schiff and numerous other politicians, pundits, and various left-wing loons are still digging through that manure pile looking for the pony they are certain is there.
833028146	11	It's sort of like Bullwinkle pulling a rabbit out of his hat ("Nuthin up my sleeve...presto!")
833028146	12	"Wrong hat," Adam.
833028680	1	Understanding Mueller: What you need to know about the report on the Russia probe
833028680	3	Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
833028680	4	Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
833028680	5	Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is now complete, and he has now submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr.
833028680	6	But the extent of the probe's impact is not yet known.
833028680	7	Here's a guide to understanding how we got here, and what may come next.
833028680	8	It started May 17, 2017, eight days after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.
833028680	9	Mueller, a former federal prosecutor and director of the FBI, was given a broad mandate: A "full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election ... any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation ... any other matters" within the scope of the special counsel law.
833028680	10	No new indictments are expected, but 34 individuals and three separate companies have been charged.
833028680	11	There have been seven guilty pleas and 99.5 months in prison served.
833028680	12	Those charged include: Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman; Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney; and Michael Flynn, who was briefly National Security Adviser.
833028680	13	Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian companies face 161 total charges as part of Mueller's probe, though it is unlikely they will ever see an American court.
833028680	14	The public may never see all of Mueller's findings — that decision rests with William Barr, the attorney general.
833028680	15	Justice Department guidance says Barr should only submit a "brief notification" containing "an outline of the actions and the reasons for them."
833028680	16	He can choose to make much of Mueller's report public if he deems it in the public interest.
833028680	17	Regardless of what Mueller's report shows, congressional investigations are ongoing.
833028680	18	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, has expanded the parameters of the committee's probe.
833028680	19	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has launched an extensive investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.
833028680	20	In early March, the Judiciary Committee requested documents
833028680	21	The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York has also launched investigations into Mr. Trump and the Trump organization.

833028932	3	The Mueller Report Finally Drops, Dems Prepare List of Demands
833028932	4	It's Friday, that means it is panel time!
833028932	5	Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has submitted a confidential report to US Attorney General William P. Barr, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.
833028932	6	The Justice Department notified Congress late Friday that it had received Mueller's report but did not describe its contents.
833028932	7	Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers in the coming days.
833028932	8	UK Prime Minister Theresa May previously sought agreement by the EU's 27 leaders on a "technical extension" of Article 50, pushing Brexit day back to June 30, in the event that the House of Commons ratifies the withdrawal agreement in its third vote on the deal.
833028932	9	The extra time would be needed to pass the necessary legislation.
833028932	10	May's appeal to the heads of state and government was described by sources as "90 minutes of nothing."
833028932	11	She was unable to offer any answers as to how a no-deal Brexit would be avoided if the deal were rejected again.
833028932	12	The leaders imposed a new Brexit timeline on the prime minister to avoid a possible accidental no-deal scenario next Friday, March 29.
833028932	13	Under the new timeline, Britain will stay a member state until April 12 if the withdrawal agreement is rejected by MPs.
833028932	14	If lawmakers accept the prime minister's Brexit deal, the UK will leave the EU by May 22.
833028932	15	The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can "indicate a way forward" and agrees to hold European elections.
833028932	16	The FBI has reportedly joined a criminal investigation of the certification process for Boeing's 737 Max 8 jets, two of which have crashed since October, killing 346 people.
833028932	17	The Seattle Times first reported that the bureau is assisting federal aviation investigators in a federal grand jury probe based in Washington, DC, looking into the process.
833028932	18	Indonesian airline Garuda said Friday that it's canceling a multi-billion-dollar order for 49 737 Max 8 jets in light of the deadly crashes.
833028932	19	"Our passengers have lost confidence to fly with the Max 8," Garuda spokesperson Ikhsan Rosan told CNN.
833028932	20	The Indonesian carrier ordered 50 of the planes in 2014 for $4.9 billion.
833028932	21	It has taken delivery of one of them but has now sent a letter to Boeing saying it no longer wants to receive the remaining jets on order, Ikhsan said.
833028932	22	Garuda is the first airline to say it's canceling a 737 Max 8 order.
833028932	23	US President Donald Trump on Thursday took more shots at the late Sen. John McCain, despite growing calls from Republicans and veterans groups to stop attacking the Arizona GOP lawmaker who died last year.
833028932	24	In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump called McCain "horrible" for his 2017 vote against a congressional Republican measure to repeal Obamacare and accused him of handing a dossier of explosive claims about Trump's ties to Russia to the FBI for "very evil purposes."
833028932	25	When asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo why he continues to criticize McCain, who died seven months ago after battling brain cancer, Trump claimed he was prompted by the news media.
833028932	26	"I don't talk about it," the president said.
833028932	27	"People ask me the question.
833028932	28	I didn't bring this up.
833028932	29	You just brought it up.
833028932	30	You just asked the question."
833028932	31	Trump renewed his attacks on McCain last weekend in an apparent reaction to a news report about the controversial dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele, not after he was asked about his attitude toward the senator.
833028932	32	He has continued to lash out at McCain over the past several days, telling reporters on Tuesday, "I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be," and then on Wednesday grousing about not receiving a "thank you" for approving funeral arrangement plans for McCain, despite his dislike for the former senator.
833028932	33	McCain was memorialized at Washington's National Cathedral last fall, and Trump was not invited to attend.
833028932	34	Trump authorized a government airplane to transport McCain's remains from Arizona to the nation's capital, but the cathedral said Trump's approval was not needed to host the funeral.
833028932	35	It took New Zealand just six days to announce an immediate plan to change to the nation's gun policy after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week.
833028932	36	On Thursday, a day after the first victims were laid to rest, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used in last week's attack.
833028932	37	Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance in Parliament.
833028932	38	The new law could be in place as soon as April 11.

833032366	1	Mueller Report On President Trump Sent To Attorney General
833032366	3	WASHINGTON, D.C. — The highly anticipated Mueller Report on the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was delivered to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, Barr told lawmakers in a letter.
833032366	4	In the letter, Barr told lawmakers that he was reviewing the report and that he anticipates telling Congress about the conclusion in the report as soon as this weekend.
833032366	5	It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see and Barr said in his Friday letter that he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what information can be released to the public and Congress consistent with the law, the Special Counsel regulations and the DOJ's practices and policies.
833032366	6	President Donald Trump on Friday called the investigation a "witch hunt" and a "hoax."
833032366	7	"So we'll see what happens," Trump told reporters on Friday.
833032366	8	"I know that the Attorney General, highly respected, ultimately will make a decision."
833032366	9	In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the next steps are up to Barr and the administration looks forward to the process taking its course.
833032366	10	"The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report," Sanders said.
833032366	11	The delivery of the report to the Department of Justice means that the nearly two-year inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives has come to a close.
833032366	12	Mueller's inquiry has led to a number of indictments and guilty pleas, including from former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
833032366	13	You can read Barr's full letter to Congress below:
833032366	14	A.G. Barr has confirmed the completion of the Special Counsel investigation.
833032366	15	We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials.
833032366	16	Transparency and the public interest demand nothing less.
833032366	17	The need for public faith in the rule of law must be the priority.

833032367	22	SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANY MORE INDICTMENTS AS PART OF HIS INVESTIGATION, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED FRIDAY EVENING.
833032367	23	A senior Justice Department official announced the development shortly after the special counsel submitted its final report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
833032367	24	Barr will now review the report and write his own report on Mueller’s findings and present them to Congress as soon as this weekend.
833032367	25	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
833032367	26	He also said at no time did the Justice Department prevent Mueller from any actions he sought to make during the course of his investigation.
833032367	27	President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery is that he is “glad it’s over,” reported ABC News.
833032367	28	In a separate statement, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow said:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.
833032367	29	Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”
833032367	30	Following confirmation of the report’s delivery, several top Democrat lawmakers demanded its immediate public release.
833032367	31	Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mueller’s findings “must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
833032367	32	Nothing short of that will suffice.”
833032367	33	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) echoed Warner’s remarks, stating: “It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.”
833032367	34	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the former chair of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement “that we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion.”
833032367	35	“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
833032367	36	Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.
833032367	37	“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries.”
833036176	1	No One Knows What’s in the Mueller Report.
833036176	2	Here’s Why This Republican Is Claiming Vindication Anyway
833036176	4	Attorney General William Barr has not yet sent the conclusions of the Mueller report to Congress, but that didn’t stop some Republicans from claiming vindication.
833036176	5	Although House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has not yet seen the report for himself, he nevertheless commented on reports that Mueller did not recommend any new indictments, claiming that it proves there was no collusion between Trump and Russia.
833036176	6	In truth, Mueller’s investigation has already led to a slew of indictments, guilty pleas or convictions from 34 people and three companies, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, and close ally Roger Stone.
833036176	7	But Scalise and other Trump allies seized on news reported in outlets including the New York Times and the Washington Post that quoted a “senior justice department official” as saying that Mueller’s report recommended no further indictments.

833036176	10	“Like most Americans, I am glad to see that this investigation, which has taken nearly two years and cost tens of millions of dollars, has finally come to a close,” Scalise said in a statement.
833036176	11	“The reports that there will be no new indictments confirm what we’ve known all along: there was never any collusion with Russia.
833036176	12	The only collusion was between Democrats and many in the media who peddled this lie because they continue to refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election.
833036176	13	I am glad Attorney General Barr will now be able to review the report, and I look forward to Congress being fully briefed on its findings, including the cost to taxpayers.”
833036176	14	Even if the Mueller report does not recommend further indictments, that does not mean President Trump and those in his orbit are in the clear.
833036176	15	The former FBI head has already referred several cases to career prosecutors at the Justice Department — and may have made other referrals that aren’t public yet.
833036176	16	The Democrat-controlled House also continues to pursue its own investigation into the President’s alleged ties to Russia.
833036176	17	Furthermore, it is long-standing policy in the Department of Justice that a sitting President cannot be indicted.
833036176	18	Still, news that the report recommends no further indictments was cause célèbre for those close to the President.
833036176	19	“675 days, millions spent, a team of people biased against the President, and NO COLLUSION FOUND,” tweeted Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, in a message retweeted by the the President’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.
833036176	20	North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows also tweeted that “The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel.
833036176	21	If that’s true, it would mean we just completed two years of investigating ‘Russian collusion’ without ONE collusion related indictment.
833036176	22	Not even one.
833036176	23	Why?

833036489	1	Bill Maher says he doesn't need Mueller report to know Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'
833036489	3	Bill Maher has said he doesn't need the Robert Mueller report to know President Donald Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'.
833036489	4	Speaking on his Friday night show the Real Time host said: 'I must say, I don't think it looks good.
833036489	5	No further indictments, which means not Don Jr., even after the "I love it" memo, really?
833036489	6	Not Jared, not Manafort or Stone for working with the Russians.
833036489	7	'Did the Democrats put too must trust in the Mueller report?
833036489	8	Because I don't need the Mueller report to know he's a traitor.
833036489	9	I have a TV.'
833036489	10	Maher was joined by a panel of Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Russia Evelyn Farkas.
833036489	11	After labeling Trump a traitor the audience the clapped in approval.
833036489	12	Swalwell agreed, saying 'yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice'.
833036489	13	Real Time host Bill Maher said Friday night he doesn't need the Robert Mueller report to know President Donald Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'
833036489	14	Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
833036489	15	Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president'
833036489	16	Swalwell said: 'And people are on their way to jail, have gone to jail, there's probably a farming out of other investigations, but yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice.
833036489	17	'But here's what's important is that the public sees the report contemporaneously with the president.
833036489	18	He should not be allowed to edit, he should not be allowed to restrict or sanitize, and Mueller has to come before Congress and tell us its veracity.'
833036489	19	He said they would subpoena Mueller to testify before Congress to make that happen.
833036489	20	Anderson said she was 'glad' that the Mueller report was filed, suggesting that the president had helped to drive down the public's opinion of the special counsel's investigation.
833036489	21	Maher added: 'He knows how to do that - to hammer the same thing every day, month after month after month.
833036489	22	''Mueller's dirty, I'm clean!"
833036489	23	Can you imagine getting people to believe that?'
833036489	24	Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
833036489	25	He delivered a long-awaited report Friday to Attorney General Bill Barr, opening up the possibility that key members of Congress could know its bottom line by the end of the weekend.
833036489	26	President Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president.'

833039623	3	Carload of crazies headed to the White House want to use the visceral hatred foisted upon society by Barack Obama, will pave the way to plunge America the Beautiful into a total Bernie Sanders-Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed Socialist State
833039623	4	Robert Mueller III Rests His Case—Dems NEVER Will
833039623	5	Hounded like a fox, hated at every turn, President Donald Trump is—just as half of America steadfastly believed—innocent of all charges ofRussian collusion for simply winning the 2016 presidential election—a reality of life the loony left still refuse to believe.
833039623	6	The $27-million-plus Robert Mueller III Special Counsel rested its case yesterday with no further indictments coming in a delivery, Fox News-described as being “met with stunned surprise and tears?” on CNN and MSNBC”.
833039623	7	Too bad that President Trump won’t likely get to say, “MY TURN!” Unfortunately, no tears will ever be shed that so many called out by the two-and-a-half-year-long investigation will have to spend the rest of their lives in debt for the legal counsel they were forced to hire for the defence of their lives.It is a true life tragedy that Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, who brought all this human suffering about, will never be held accountable for using a salacious, wholly debunked dirty dossier centred on “golden showers” by prostitutes supposedly brought in to defile a bed once slept in by the sacrosanct Obamas..
833039623	8	The real perps in the made-up-from-whole-cloth world-circulated Russian collusion conspiracy are not just walking away, they’re running away with some of the runners planning new books to keep their debunked conspiracy alive.
833039623	9	Too bad that the perpetrators of the false Russians-stole-the-election conspiracy ruined the reputation of what was once America’s most respected intelligence agency by making some of its top brass an active part if it.
833039623	10	Too bad that the Law of the Land ended up treating Paul Manafort, found guilty of financial crimes—not Russian collusion—as though he were an al Qaeda terrorist, and who to this very day is still held in solitary confinement in prison.
833039623	11	Too bad that President Trump won’t likely get to say, “MY TURN!” being far too busy having to bear the slings and arrows aimed at him, his family and surrogates all because the witch hunt tearing a nation apart, will, in one way or the other, continue to carry on.
833039623	12	Count on, dirt-digging, blackmail-ready Democrats and the media continuing to carry on the Hatefest If anything the last two and a half years has shown is that hatred once unleashed and crazy conduct don’t go away overnight.
833039623	13	The best take I heard on the revelation that the about-to-be-lionized Mueller had packed it in came from Tony Mangan, spokesman for the little guy, an unrecognized minority that still exists.
833039623	14	“Well Whooptidoo, so what?” “I have been chewing nails and spitting rust since this conclusion to the Mueller investigation is being discussed everywhere, on TV, Radio, Newspapers, Internet and probably around the water cooler.
833039623	15	“But nowhere have I heard anyone broach some truth, while some are announcing in a celebratory tone that the Mueller Investigation has concluded and he has announced that there will be no indictments for Russian Collusion, no collusion indictments to obstruct justice etc., etc., etc.
833039623	16	“The whole conspiracy was started based on afalse dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat party, handed over to the FBI who knew it was a concoction headed by a former British spy, carried to the next step by the FBI in order to obtain FISA warrants that would allow them to surveil the Trump campaign, and perform wire taps that were based on an illegal process, and people are saying Mueller is known to be a very ethical investigator, and we are sure he did a thorough job over the last two years, while in fact he could have concluded the investigation in the first two days based on the fact that it originated from a fake dossier.
833039623	17	Since the investigation was motivated by a fake document and suspiciously Illegal Warrants, they still went forward based on NOTHING..
833039623	18	“ Count on, dirt-digging, blackmail-ready Democrats and the media continuing to carry on the Hatefest.
833039623	19	Ear-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left Thanks to Paul Sperry over at Real Clear Investigations, it was revealed only days before delivery of Mueller’s Special Counsel Report that dirty dossier writer, Christopher Steele is still on the payroll, still out there digging in Hillary’s manure pile.
833039623	20	That ought to keep self-serving RINOs like Mitt Romney hiding under their desks straight up through the 2020 election.
833039623	21	In the ear-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left, the masses should never forget how we got from Nov. 8, 2016 to yesterday.
833039623	22	The Establishment refused to believe that life would go on without them—but it did.
833039623	23	They plunged the world into an environment of seething hatred, one in which even school children could be attacked for political reasons.
833039623	24	Those who refuse to believe that life would go on without them also refuse to believe in God’s Will, and will never recognize that it is God Almighty and not politics that rules the world.
833039623	25	The Witch Hunt will continue The Witch Hunt will continue with note-passing debate-fixer Donna Brazile now inside the Fox News Hen House giving full-throated voice to what someone else calls “the car load of crazies” Democrat hopefuls, each one of them hoping to be America’s next president, while the voice of conservatives continues to be mainstream and social media suppressed.
833039623	26	But the picture at least is now crystal clear that the carload of crazies headed to the White House want to use the visceral hatred that was foisted upon society when Barack Obama made it into power, will pave the way to plunge America the Beautiful into a total Bernie Sanders’/ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Socialist State.
833039623	27	Little do they know that at least half the country see what they’re up to as the ongoing Battle of Good Against Evil , or that the narrative that matters most is the one that can be found in the words of a prayer: “As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be”.
833039623	28	Meanwhile, life goes on, and until the Creator calls it a day, always will.

833040400	1	Mueller Report Being Reviewed By A.G. Barr On Saturday
833040400	3	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Attorney General William Barr is reviewing the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, according to CNN.
833040400	4	CNN reported that Barr arrived at the Department of Justice shortly before 10 a.m. on Saturday.
833040400	5	In a letter to lawmakers on Friday when Barr received the report, he said he anticipated telling Congress about the conclusions in the report as soon as this weekend.
833040400	6	President Donald Trump is at his Florida club in Palm Beach for the weekend and will be back in Washington D.C. on Sunday.
833040400	7	SEE ALSO: Democrats Prepared To Subpoena Mueller Report, LA's Schiff Says
833040400	8	It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see.
833040400	9	Democratic lawmakers are calling on the full release of the report to the public.
833040400	10	"Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress," Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuch Schumer, said in a joint statement.
833040400	11	"Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.
833040400	12	"The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.
833040400	13	The American people have a right to the truth.
833040400	14	The watchword is transparency."

833041409	1	Beto O'Rourke says he still believes that Trump conspired with Russia
833041409	3	Candidate for the Democrat presidential nomination Beto O'Rourke has said he still believes that President Donald Trump conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election.
833041409	4	O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory.
833041409	5	'You have a president who in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government, a foreign power, to undermine and influence our elections,' O'Rourke said.
833041409	6	'It is beyond the shadow of a doubt that the president once in office sought to obstruct justice,' he continued.
833041409	7	O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory
833041409	8	His remarks came soon after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his investigative report, which a Justice Department official says indicates he will not file further indictments.
833041409	9	In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
833041409	10	But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
833041409	11	US Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to hand Congress as early as Saturday the key findings of the report.
833041409	12	O'Rourke, seen campaigning on Friday, reiterated his belief in a Russian conspiracy
833041409	13	Trump is seen arriving in Florida on Friday to spend the weekend at Mar-a-lago.
833041409	14	He has not tweeted or spoken publicly since news of the report broke
833041409	15	Chronic tweeter Trump, who was at his Florida residence for the weekend, remained uncommonly silent after spending two years repeatedly labeling Mueller's investigation an illegal witch hunt.
833041409	16	The White House has not received a copy of the report or been briefed on it, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.
833041409	17	'The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,' Sanders said in a statement.
833041409	18	Meanwhile Democrats in Congress, many of who are hoping for evidence to support a presidential impeachment, were pressing hard to ensure its full contents are made public, and not just a summary prepared by the Trump-appointed Justice Department chief.
833042063	1	Chelsea Handler Admits She’s ‘Very Sexually Attracted to Robert Mueller’
833042063	3	Far-left comedienne Chelsea Handler has admitted she is “very sexually attracted” to FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller, just hours after he concluded his investigations into supposed collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
833042063	4	On Friday evening, the Justice Department announced that Mueller had concluded his investigations into the matter and that he would not be recommending any more indictments against Trump or anyone else involved in his campaign.
833042063	5	Yet despite the weight of disappointment felt by the majority on the Hollywood left, Chelsea Handler admitted that her obsession with the 74-year-old prosecutor may have been because she found him sexually attractive.
833042063	6	“If I’m being completely honest, I am very sexually attracted to Robert Mueller,” she wrote on Twitter.
833042063	7	“I know it’s not meant to be, but that doesn’t mean I won’t hang a poster of him above my bed.”
833042063	8	If I’m being completely honest, I am very sexually attracted to Robert Mueller.
833042063	9	I know it’s not meant to be, but that doesn’t mean I won’t hang a poster of him above my bed.
833042063	10	— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 23, 2019
833042063	11	Last month, the failed Netflix talk show host wished Mueller a “Happy Valentines Day,” while expressing hope that he would soon indict the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. on charges of Russian collusion or some financial misdemeanor.
833042063	12	“Happy Valentines Day to Robert Mueller, and for him giving his final rose to DonaldTrump, Jr.,” she wrote.
833042063	13	“That would make this holiday really count.”
833042063	14	Mueller’s final report has not yet been released, although Attorney General William Barr said on Friday that he could reveal its contents as soon as this weekend.
833042063	15	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr wrote in his letter the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

833050243	1	Mueller Report: 'US Forced EU to Follow Through on Sanctions Without Proof'
833050243	3	Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his report on suspected collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to the attorney general, with the report not recommending any further indictments.
833050243	4	Eurasia Centre senior researcher Earl Rasmussen spoke to Sputnik about the report's implications for Trump and his opponents.
833050243	5	Sputnik: What do we know?
833050243	6	What can we expect?
833050243	7	It looks like Donald Trump won't receive any political damage to his image, because of course the report doesn't recommend any further indictments.
833050243	8	What's your stance?
833050243	9	Earl Rasmussen: Obviously there are certain elements, mostly in the mainstream media that's been stoking this, and certain members on the Hill, in Congress, that were hoping for something, because we heard over and over again that the next bombshell was coming.
833050243	10	But you're correct, there's nothing explosive, and with no new indictments coming out, and really if you look at the indictments that were there, there's nothing related at all to any type of conspiracy or collusion as far as the six people indicted who are US citizens.
833050243	11	And the Russians that are indicted are questionable.
833050243	12	Let's face it, Concord Management tried to file discovery, and now [prosecutors are] trying to block information, saying it's 'classified'.
833050243	13	© AP Photo / Alex Brandon Democrat Leaders Demand White House Not Get Preview of Mueller Report
833050243	14	There's really no evidence, and for Mr. Trump, although he will suffer some political damage, I think for the most part the objective of this whole hoax is not coming to fruition.
833050243	15	Sputnik: For now of course, no one really knows what's in the report, how long it is, how much it actually deals with the president's own actions.
833050243	16	However, a lot of political and perhaps emotional capital was invested in this Mueller probe.
833050243	17	Is this a bit of an anticlimax?
833050243	18	Earl Rasmussen: I think for many it is an anticlimax, absolutely.
833050243	19	There's so much invested here.
833050243	20	Two plus years, millions of dollars, political capital on both sides, and you've got people who have lost their livelihoods.
833050243	21	A lot of the people that were brought in, their names exposed, their reputations were damaged.
833050243	22	We've got the six people that have been charged [for] things that happened ten years ago; some are financially ruined now; some will spend time in jail for lying to Congress or lying to the FBI over minor financial things that may have gone unnoticed without this.
833050243	23	You look at the other side too, and we've got damage to international relations, not just with Russia, where what has occurred is just outrageous, but also Europe.
833050243	24	I mean we forced Europe to follow through on sanctions that there's no evidence for.
833050243	25	They've lost business as a result of that, so I'm sure the Europeans will be quite interested in seeing more and learning more about what's coming out of this as well.
833050243	26	© AP Photo / Evan Vucci Trump Again Supports Idea of Making Mueller’s Russia Probe Report Public
833050243	27	The country is divided.
833050243	28	Talk about political discord – the media here has done a great job doing that.
833050243	29	In a lot of ways we've done a lot of damage to ourselves chasing after something that's not there.
833050243	30	Sputnik: US Attorney General William Barr is going to now summarise the report and decide on how much to share with Congress.
833050243	31	What can we expect?
833050243	32	Earl Rasmussen: Personally I think the whole report should be released to the public at some point in time.
833050243	33	He'll release it to Congress, I think most of it will probably be provided to Congress.
833050243	34	There should be nothing there that they don't already know.
833050243	35	They've been doing their own investigations, have called in their own witnesses, so there really should be no surprises there.
833050243	36	Obviously the parties will probably try to manipulate the report [against the other party] in order to potentially posture for the 2020 presidential elections.

833052347	1	US reacts to end of Mueller probe with relief, skepticism
833052347	3	This undated photo shows Dajah Harris, in Norfolk, Va. Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like the border wall, homelessness, college debt and welfare programs..The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions..
833052347	4	(Ben Finley/Associated Press)
833052347	5	PHILADELPHIA — With the long-awaited special counsel’s investigation finished but its contents still shrouded in mystery, Americans waited for details, yawned with boredom or stayed fixed to their long-cemented positions on President Donald Trump, the man at the probe’s center.
833052347	6	For all the expected splash of Robert Mueller’s report, it arrived with more of a thud, thanks to the secrecy surrounding it.
833052347	7	Few saw reason to think it would sway many opinions in a divided republic.
833052347	8	Helen Jones, a 72-year-old retired English professor in Salt Lake City, Utah, who is Republican but despises Trump, knows whatever comes out, her relatives who strongly back the president won’t budge — just as detractors like her won’t be convinced he isn’t a crook.
833052347	9	She sees no simple end in sight.
833052347	10	“I think it’s just the beginning,” said Jones, a political junkie who called the moment a historic one like Watergate.
833052347	11	“I hope it’s a turning point in the Trump presidency.”
833052347	12	Across ideology, many expressed relief Saturday that the investigation was finally over.
833052347	13	“Now maybe we can move on to better things,” said Bubba Metts, a 61-year-old conservative who is a financial adviser in Lexington, South Carolina.
833052347	14	“Twenty million dollars spent — for nothing.”
833052347	15	Dajah Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.
833052347	16	But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like homelessness, college debt and welfare programs.
833052347	17	The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions.
833052347	18	“I don’t feel that where the country is right now that this is something we should even be discussing,” she said.
833052347	19	Mueller worked in virtual silence as a stream of charges have flowed forth against 37 people and companies.
833052347	20	From the start, with his appointment on May 17, 2017, some have framed his work as a battle of good and evil of biblical proportions.
833052347	21	And on the 675th day, Mueller finished his work, and he rested.
833052347	22	But nothing immediately changed for those who had watched with bated breath.
833052347	23	For Mark Itzen, a 64-year-old social worker from Levittown, Pennsylvania, it was a frustrating reality.
833052347	24	“The most disturbing thing for me is that we don’t know the details,” the Democrat said.
833052347	25	“I thought we have the right to know right off the bat after all this anticipation.”
833052347	26	Expectations remained high for some sort of explosive revelation, but what exactly it might be remained anyone’s guess.
833052347	27	For liberals who welcomed the investigation with gleeful shouts of “It’s Mueller Time!” and anxiously awaited justice that aligns with their view of Trump as Antichrist, it seemed the endless billows of smoke would surely produce evidence of fire.
833052347	28	For conservatives who subscribed to the president’s view of the probe as a witch hunt and dismissed it as the misguided tomfoolery of a bitter opposition whose search for retribution is as loopy as its policies, it seemed certain to bring exoneration to Trump and maybe even a roadmap for future victory by him and his party.
833052347	29	Jason Cox, a 51-year-old farmer in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to again next year, saw it the way Trump framed it — as a witch hunt.
833052347	30	“It didn’t turn out, it seems to me, the way Democrats wanted,” he said.
833052347	31	“I think Pelosi and Schumer are going to just keep beating and badgering and looking for something.”
833052347	32	Stanley Twardy, legal adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law, which worked to protect the Mueller investigation from political interference, said the report won’t bring a quick end to anything.
833052347	33	“It’s not like the report will be issued and everybody says, ‘OK, we’re done now,’” he said.
833052347	34	“This is all part of a process.
833052347	35	The process will work its way out.
833052347	36	This is why our country has stood the test of time.”
833052347	37	Shaela and Cindy Buchanan were tackling chores Saturday morning at the Lost Sock Laundromat in Wichita, Kansas, when the topic of Mueller was raised.
833052347	38	“Which one is Mueller?” asked Cindy, a 51-year-old manager at a paint company.
833052347	39	She doesn’t follow politics closely but liked Trump at first.
833052347	40	The questions about Russia, though, caused the 51-year-old paint company manager to reconsider.
833052347	41	Her 48-year-old wife Shaela, who considers herself a political independent, sees Trump as “bought and paid for” while regular people live paycheck to paycheck.
833052347	42	She doubts Mueller’s report ultimately does anything to change that.
833052347	43	“I don’t feel it is over once it is released,” Shaela Buchanan said.
833052347	44	“People any more they have suffered to the point they don’t have any power — it doesn’t matter.”
833052347	45	Peter Malak, a 42-year-old high school civics teacher from northeastern North Carolina, offered similar thoughts.
833052347	46	He calls himself a swing voter who tends to lean right.
833052347	47	While the media obsess over the Mueller report, he said, most Americans just want to pay their mortgages.
833052347	48	“The average person just doesn’t care,” he said, while stopping for a haircut.
833052347	49	“Your life is going to go on either way, regardless of what the Mueller investigation comes out to be.”

833053628	1	Confident Trump and anxious Washington wait for AG Barr's report on Mueller's key findings
833053628	3	Justice Department sources tell Fox News that Attorney General William Barr is working to quickly release the primary conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded Russia investigation.
833053628	4	That information, however, wasn't expected to emerge on Saturday.
833053628	5	For Washington insiders, the waiting game isn't easy.
833053628	6	Speculation about the hotly anticipated report's contents has been rampant.
833053628	7	Still, in a show of confidence, President Trump waved and flashed two thumbs up to supporters as he returned to his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.
833053628	8	The president's demeanor signaled the administration's strong belief that Mueller's long-awaited final report contained good news.
833053628	9	Among other things, the special counsel is not recommending any further indictments as part of his inquiry, which effectively ended Friday, according to a senior Justice Department official.
833053628	10	Further, Mueller did not charge any Americans with illegally conspiring with Russians on any matter, including election interference -- a foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago.
833053628	11	Even as Trump remained in Florida, Barr was working "hand in hand" on Saturday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in reviewing the Mueller report at the DOJ, the senior official said.
833053628	12	Fox News is told that Barr may run the conclusions past White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Emmett Flood, who were in Mar-a-Lago, before they are released -- but that Trump's personal attorneys are unlikely to be notified.
833053628	13	It will likely take longer for the facts supporting the conclusions to come out, Fox News is told, because there may be materials that are either classified, or subject to executive privilege in the factual material.

833053628	15	Barr notified key congressional leaders in a letter Friday evening that Mueller finished his investigation, adding that a summary of the probe’s findings may be provided to lawmakers as soon as this weekend.
833053628	16	Fox News has also confirmed that House Democrats, meanwhile, began a conference call at approximately 3:10 p.m.E.T.
833053628	17	Saturday with “chairs of relevant committees” discussing next steps regarding the Mueller report and messaging.
833053628	18	New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will host as Caucus Chair, and attendees will include Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, as well as Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters.
833053628	19	At the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for a public release of the Mueller report, and said she would reject any classified briefing of the report's findings to lawmakers.
833053628	20	Any briefing must be unclassified so that members of Congress can talk about it publicly, Pelosi said.
833053628	21	Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Saturday: "It’s the end of the beginning.
833053628	22	But it’s not the beginning of the end."
833053628	23	He added: "We’re spending the weekend in anticipation of what Attorney General Barr may share with Congress," and cautioned that Democrats were "concerned executive privilege could be asserted broadly here" to hide the report's key findings.
833053628	24	In a Saturday conference call, Coons also issued a warning for his fellow Democrats, many of whom have pinned astronomical political hopes on Mueller's findings: "Once we get the principal conclusions of the report, I think it's entirely possible that that will be a good day for the president and his core supporters."
833053628	25	CHAFFETZ: HYPOCRITICAL DEMS SUDDENLY CARE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY
833053628	26	Some advocacy groups have made clear they aren't keen on waiting.
833053628	27	A nonprofit organization on Friday night filed the first known Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking the immediate and total public disclosure of Mueller's completed report and all related documents, echoing bipartisan calls for transparency following his nearly two-year probe into whether the Trump campaign illegally colluded with Russia.
833053628	28	The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) wrote in an emergency complaint filed in a Washington, D.C., federal district court that the "public has a right to know the full scope of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and whether the president of the United States played any role in such interference."
833053628	29	The delivery of the Mueller report, which a DOJ official called "comprehensive," does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia or of obstruction by the president.
833053628	30	That's good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
833053628	31	They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller's prosecutors.
833053628	32	Still, some key details remain unanswered, EPIC said, prompting its litigation.
833053628	33	House Democrats, meanwhile, have somewhat downplayed the Mueller probe and suggested that the left-leaning lawmakers themselves might take on the job of trying to prove collusion, not ruling out the possibility of Mueller being asked or subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees.

833053628	35	“If the Justice Department doesn't release the whole report or tries to keep parts of it secret, we will certainly subpoena the parts of the report and we will reserve the right to call Mueller to testify before the committee or to subpoena him,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
833053628	36	While the Mueller probe’s conclusions are not yet known, the investigation already has led to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for nearly three dozen people and three companies.
833053628	37	All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; and three Russian companies.
833053628	38	Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet.
833053628	39	Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
833053628	40	OPINION: WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD REJECT THE MUELLER REPORT
833053628	41	Despite all that prosecutorial activity, though, Americans were not implicated in criminally colluding with Russia to influence the election.
833053628	42	In a series of posts on Twitter on Friday, journalist Glenn Greenwald -- who also called for the release of the Mueller report -- repeatedly emphasized that point, and condemned pundits for hyping the Mueller report irresponsibly for nearly two years.
833053628	43	"It's truly fascinating to watch Dems grapple with the fact that Mueller finished his work without indicting a single American for conspiring with Russia over the election: everything from "nobody has read his report!"
833053628	44	(irrelevant to that fact) to 'sealed indictments!'
833053628	45	(unhinged)."
833053628	46	Greenwald wrote.
833053628	47	In another post, he criticized media outlets for promoting the anti-Trump rhetoric of partisan commentators like ex-CIA Director John Brennan -- an Obama appointee whose security clearance was revoked last year because, the Trump administration said, he was using it to lend credence to political attacks.
833053628	48	"You can't blame MSNBC viewers for being confused," Greenwald continued.
833053628	49	"They largely kept dissenters from their Trump/Russia spy tale off the air for 2 years.
833053628	50	As recently as 2 weeks ago, they had @JohnBrennan strongly suggesting Mueller would indict Trump family members on collusion as his last act.
833053628	51	... Oh gosh - turns out that if you hire ex-CIA Directors to be 'news analysts,' they'll abuse our airwaves to disseminate self-serving disinformation."
833053628	52	He concluded: "How - if you're an MSNBC viewer (or consumer of similar online content) - can you not be angry & disoriented having been fed utter [bulls--t] like this for 2 straight years with basically no dissent allowed?
833053628	53	Just listen to what they were telling you to believe & how false it was."

833053628	55	Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it "imperative" to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
833053628	56	"The American people have a right to the truth," Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
833053628	57	Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a "sneak preview" of the findings.
833053628	58	"The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public," they said in a joint statement.
833053628	59	It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller's findings.
833053628	60	Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying, "We look forward to the process taking its course."
833053628	61	But Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get "an early look" before they were made public.
833053628	62	Giuliani said it was "appropriate" for the White House to be able "to review matters of executive privilege."
833053628	63	He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
833053628	64	He later softened his stance, saying the decision was "up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly."
833053628	65	The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report's arrival Friday.
833053628	66	Barr's chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
833053628	67	Fox News' Ed Henry, Mike Emanuel, Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

833053676	3	Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) offered his thoughts on the completion of Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which was submitted to Attorney General William Barr a day earlier.
833053676	4	Lewis insisted Congress will demand the report be released to the public.
833053676	5	The Georgia Democrat also said he still believed President Donald Trump’s impeachment was still inevitable.
833053676	6	“I think that day will come,” Lewis said when asked by Reid about impeachment prospects.
833053676	7	“I don’t think he’s legitimate.

833067493	1	Don Trump Jr uses Maury Povich paternity meme to mock Democrats
833067493	3	Donald Trump Jr has used a Maury Povich meme to mock Democrats over the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
833067493	4	'Democrats, the test results are back, and Donald Trump is your daddy,' read the text on the image Trump Jr posted on Instagram Saturday, a day after Mueller filed his final report.
833067493	5	Trump Jr added in a comment: '... and your president,' along with three laughing emojis.
833067493	6	The image depicted Povich, whose long running daytime talk show often features startling revelations about love triangles and cheating spouses.
833067493	7	Trump Jr posted the above meme to his Instagram account on Saturday
833067493	8	Trump Jr (seen last year) mocked Democrats saying that the 'test results' show that President Donald Trump is their 'daddy'
833067493	9	It came as President Donald Trump's supporters trumpeted reports that Mueller will seek no additional prosecutions, despite months of feverish predictions that Trump Jr or other close Trump associates would be the next to face indictment.
833067493	10	In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
833067493	11	But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
833067493	12	Attorney General William Barr is now expected to deliver his summary of Mueller's findings to Congress no sooner than Sunday.
833067493	13	MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was disheartened at the news that Mueller would not seek further indictments.
833067493	14	She is seen above interview Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff
833067493	15	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement that Barr's offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report's conclusions is insufficient and that 'Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents.'
833067493	16	Senator Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump and his core team could still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes.
833067493	17	Trump's business, his charity and his presidential transition operation remain under investigation, Coons said, and congressional Democrats would keep looking into his activities.
833067493	18	'It's the end of the beginning, but it's not the beginning of the end,' Coons told reporters on a telephone conference.
231	1	How Macron and his clique tamper with unemployment figures
231	3	"As if by chance, a few days before a second round when Marine Le Pen suddenly became a Nazi again, the unemployment figures miraculously fell by 600,000, nothing less, and the media collaborated to rave again about our ""Mozart of the economy"" who has served as our president for five years. Except that…"
231	4	Here is a quick explanation of how INSEE, on the orders of Macron and his clique, fakes and falsifies the real unemployment figures.
231	5	"You should know that INSEE produces its figures by carrying out a survey of only 110,000 people (while the active population is 29 million people in France!) then by making ""corrections"" (which they call "" weights”) obscure, to produce the final figure."
231	6	However, in 2021, INSEE changed its survey and its weighting:
231	7	The Employment Survey is being revamped in 2021: from the reasons for its overhaul to the impacts on the measurement of employment and unemployment (INSEE ANALYSES, No 65, 06/29/2021)
231	8	https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/5402123
231	9	"In the middle of this article, INSEE reveals that this new version has ""magically"" increased the employment rate of 15-64 year olds by 0.8% all at once (which corresponds to 270,000 more people in employment). ), and that of women by 1.4%! In short, we change the questionnaire and the weighting, and hop, the employment rate increases, so the unemployment rate drops!"
231	10	It should be remembered that the increasingly significant discrepancy between the figures of INSEE (used by the government and the media) and those of Pôle Emploi has been known for years:
231	11	Unemployment: why the figures from INSEE and Pôle emploi differ 24-08-17
231	12	https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/08/24/chomage-pourquoi-les-chiffres-de-l-insee-et-de-pole-emploi-different_5176176_4355770.html
231	13	Excerpt from this article:
231	14	“In 2013, INSEE changed the questionnaires for its employment survey. After the marginal reformulation of certain questions, the answers were profoundly modified. Thus, an INSEE interviewer will no longer ask you if you were “looking for a job, even part-time or casual”, but if you were “looking for a job” period.
231	15	Combined with others, this modification was enough to tip a few “yes” on the side of “no”. The Institute's experts estimated in March 2014 that the new questionnaire had artificially lowered the unemployment rate by 0.5 points, i.e. 145,000 fewer unemployed people. »
231	16	In short: the unemployment figures are faked!
231	17	"And that, not to mention that in September 2021, the State ordered the SNCF to hire en masse ""young people"" in HR (Human Relations) jobs, that is to say jobs useless, created to artificially lower the number of unemployed, by further indebting the SNCF. This information was given to me in person by the director of an important branch of the SNCF network, at the beginning of October; she was shocked by this request from the government."
231	18	It is likely that other public companies have received such an order.
231	19	While Macron and his clique falsify reality, the French economy declines even more.
23104	1	"""The European Union's climate strategy is set to increase deforestation on a global scale"""
23104	3	"In a column in the ""World"", three scientists, Denis Couvet, Wolfgang Cramer and Timothy Searchinger, warn about the EU's climate policy, which intends to devote 20% of cultivated land to bioenergy, and to increase imports of wood."
23104	5	To avoid catastrophic climate change and biodiversity loss, climate science warns us that humanity must stop turning forests into agricultural land, as this process releases carbon dioxide and destroys habitats. Yet as the world's population, incomes, and meat consumption grow, agricultural land is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. Europe has contributed to this deforestation by outsourcing its supply of food and other agricultural products.
23104	7	Unfortunately, the European Union's 'Fit for 55' [legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%] climate strategy is set to extend Europe's footprint and increasing deforestation globally. This is why a group of scientists from all over Europe are calling on the European Parliament to modify the plan with reasonable amendments (some have already been adopted by one of its committees).
23104	9	Vast amounts of productive land
23104	11	The plan aims to dedicate one-fifth of Europe's cropland to bioenergy by 2050. Imports of firewood for energy production will also quadruple, an annual volume roughly equivalent to 40% of the entire annual timber harvest in Canada, the second largest timber exporter in the world.
23104	13	Harvesting and burning more trees increases the amount of carbon in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries. This is true even if trees are allowed to grow back and even if wood replaces coal (the dirtiest fuel used for energy).
23104	15	"The central problem stems from a systemic error in siled thinking: the plan ignores the effects of bioenergy production for the climate and nature. Burning biomass releases more carbon than burning fossil fuels, but these emissions are ignored. The theory goes that this carbon is removed from the air as plants grow, so burning plants does not add ""net"" carbon to the air."
23105	1	Covid variants: restart or seasonal virus?
23105	3	With the arrival and the very majority circulation of BA.4 and BA.5 on French territory, the number of contaminations is on the rise again. How to analyze this recovery? Responses from epidemiologists Catherine Hill and Antoine Flahault.
23105	5	The epidemic is not seasonal. More and more contagious variants follow one another and continue to circulate the virus in waves.
23105	7	Catherine Hill Epidemiologist at the Gustave-Roussy Institute (Villejuif)
23105	9	If some think that the Covid epidemic is seasonal, it is probably by analogy with flu epidemics. But it is enough to look at the evolution of Covid mortality in the countries of the northern hemisphere and in the countries of the southern hemisphere to see that the peaks observed in the North do not correspond to the troughs observed in the South. We can also compare the dates of the peaks between two countries located in the same hemisphere, for example South Africa and Brazil, to see that in Brazil the largest peak occurred in mid-April 2021, when there were very few deaths in South Africa.
23105	11	There were three peaks in Brazil, in July 2020, April 2021 and February 2022, and four peaks in South Africa, in August 2020, January 2021, July 2021 and February 2022. In France, there were seven peaks, in April 2020, November 2020, February 2021, March 2021, August 2021, February 2022, and April 2022, so in all seasons.
23105	13	The epidemic is actually governed by the spread of increasingly contagious variants that spread from one country to another depending on the movement of people. Thus, the BA.2 variant of Omicron quickly became dominant in France, succeeding the BA.1 variant of Omicron, which itself succeeded the Delta variant.
23105	15	The BA.4 and BA.5 variants of Omicron are arriving in France, they already accounted for 46% of viruses from June 5 to 11 according to screening data, and their relative frequency is increasing rapidly. We went from 45% BA.2 to 75% BA.2 in two weeks, so we can expect to have 75% BA.4 or BA.5 soon.
23105	17	Can we then speak of recovery? Restart implies stopping, but there has been no stopping of the epidemic: as in the rest of the world, Sars-CoV-2 has never stopped circulating in France. The evolution of this circulation can be studied from several indicators: the number of positive cases, the number of patients arriving at the hospital or in intensive care and the number of deaths.
23105	19	Whatever the indicator, the circulation of the virus took place in successive waves, with highs and lows, the highs becoming less and less high because the population is partly protected from the risks by vaccination or by a previous infection, the protection being better against the most serious risks, that is to say the risks of admission to intensive care and the risks of death.
23105	21	However, the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, which arrived in Portugal earlier than in France, are associated in this country with a significant increase in mortality.
23105	23	We can therefore expect to observe the same phenomenon in France, or even worse insofar as 11% of the French population aged 80 and over has not been vaccinated at all, whereas in Portugal the vaccination coverage of population aged 60 and over is 100%.
23105	25	We are not done with the pandemic. The current wave which, after having touched Portugal, is sweeping over Europe bears witness to a restart.
23105	27	Antoine Flahault Epidemiologist, Director of the Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva (Switzerland)
23105	29	At the end of each wave, the voices of experts and politicians rise to explain, in a very optimistic tone, that this time it is all over. Let's remember the first wave, after the terrible first confinement. After the summer when we had found life almost “as before”, the second wave required another confinement. We then hoped, thanks to the good news concerning the arrival of a vaccine, that we would have finished with this pandemic. But the Alpha variant was going to thwart the plans of our favorite reassurances and require a new containment, which this time would be the last.
23105	31	But does this mean that we were done with the pandemic since June 2021? Unfortunately, the Delta wave has spread over Europe and around the world. The vaccine would change that. As we emerged in early December from what was to be our last experience with this pandemic, we saw the new Omicron variant surge in South Africa, at the start of their austral summer. It was so transmissible that nothing stopped it and hardly had we reached the peak of the Delta wave, in mid-December, that Omicron was going to spread over all of Europe without giving us the slightest respite.
23105	33	"Omicron is a large family and each of the sub-variants has its own character. BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5. Do not believe that there would be ""only"" five children in the Omicron family. North Americans today struggle with a subvariant that is called BA.2.12.1, meaning that the BA.2 subvariant once had at least 12 subvariants. It is breaking out in Martinique, which is currently experiencing the highest incidences and deaths reported to the population."
23105	35	So no, we are not done with the Covid. We would like to, but the waves rather seem to follow one another at an accelerated pace.
23105	37	It looks like BA.5 is leading the race in Western Europe. The wave caused in Portugal – and its procession of deaths – now extends to the sub-continent and in particular to metropolitan France. The Portuguese are however remarkably vaccinated, they still wear the mask on public transport, so there is little reason to think that the French will fare better. It is important to note that 93% of the mortality during this BA.5 wave in Portugal concerned people over the age of 80. They are the ones who must be protected as a very high priority, the remaining 7% were the rare unvaccinated or insufficiently vaccinated people, people immunocompromised by their treatments or their diseases.
23105	39	"So, if you want to call this virus ""seasonal"", that's up to you, but what season are we talking about? Wasn't this expression used in the past for influenza viruses and winter colds? If we look at the Covid of the last twelve months, it is rather the four seasons that this virus and its orchestra of sub-variants have played on us: I would therefore say rather a restart, you have understood it!"
23109	1	Right to abortion threatened in the United States: send them the stick in the face
23109	3	They will never leave women alone. The Supreme Court of the United States is preparing to overturn the historic judgment recognizing, for nearly half a century, the right to abortion. The leaked project is to be taken very seriously: we do not see how it could not be confirmed by this court with a clear conservative majority since the remodeling carried out by Donald Trump.
23109	5	"The fundamental right of women to terminate a pregnancy in the so-called country ""of the free"" can therefore be called into question. Women will be subject to the goodwill of the state in which they live and almost half of them are ready to tackle abortion. Not less. However, Simone de Beauvoir had warned us: “Never forget that all it takes is a political, economic or religious crisis for women's rights to be called into question. These rights are never acquired. You will have to remain vigilant throughout your life.” American women put forward the theory of the backlash: each advance in women's rights has been followed by a reactionary offensive, demonstrated in 1991 the feminist journalist Susan Faludi in an essay that is still relevant today."
23109	7	The backlash, feminists have been waiting for it since MeToo in 2017. Here it is. But can't we throw it back in their face? Between resilience and resistance, which word do we prefer? We will have to defend our rights at the ballot box. Joe Biden called for it, as early as the midterm elections in November. We will have to defend our rights in the street. As of Monday evening, hundreds of demonstrators massed in front of the temple of American law, facing the “pro-lifers”. They will have to be defended alongside associations whose importance is obvious in the face of such news. Reinstalling this balance of power is an imperative, in the United States, in Europe also where Ukrainian women victims of rape are currently prevented from having access to abortion in Poland, but also elsewhere, everywhere.
23109	9	They will never leave women alone. But we will never let them go back quietly.
2311	1	“Conference on the future of Europe: a sham of participatory democracy?”
2311	3	If there is one lesson to be learned from the Conference on the Future of Europe which has just concluded, it is that, whatever the circumstances (wars, health crises, economic slumps or calamitous precedents), there there will always be a handful of die-hards for whom the salvation of the continent depends only on a long and winding reform of the treaties. When, moreover, these diehards concoct and steer a tailor-made consultation by draping it in the tinsel of a vast “citizen consultation” which (oh surprise!) endorses their political objectives, then we are bordering on deception. And we run the risk of bogging down Europe in Byzantine debates and endless ratifications at the most inopportune moment possible.
2311	5	Through communicative sleight of hand, this Conference is now presented as a cry from the heart of European citizens which resulted in a clear mandate to reform Europe from top to bottom and integrate it further. When in fact it is not. From the outset, this consultation almost did not see the light of day. Originally, this idea was pushed relentlessly by Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian Prime Minister and avowed federalist. He and his group (Renew, where the members of the République en Marche also sit) made it one of the conditions for the election of Ursula von der Leyen, and she acceded to it, between the annoyance and the indifference of Member States. A few months later, the Covid reshuffled all the cards and this conference, contrary to the emergencies and the needs of the crisis, lost all its interest... except for Parliament, which did not budge. The compromise was therefore to launch a one-year consultation open to all Europeans and whose contributions would be channeled through a virtual platform and citizens' groups.
23112	3	"It is a summit largely devoted to Ukraine, but also to other subjects, such as China and the climate. The seven G7 powers, meeting at a summit in Bavaria, Germany, want Russia to pay the maximum cost for its invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country is presiding this year, said on Tuesday June 28. the G7, reaffirming that ""Putin must not win this war""."
23112	5	"The G7 remains united in its support for Ukraine, Olaf Scholz told a press conference after the G7 leaders' summit. ""We will continue to maintain and increase the economic and political costs of this war for President (Vladimir) Putin and his regime,"" he added."
23112	7	"The seven G7 powers also pledged on Tuesday after their meeting to ""support"" the ""reconstruction of Ukraine through an international conference and reconstruction plan"", according to a draft of final declaration consulted by AFP. The G7, joined by five emerging countries, including India, also condemned Russia's ""illegal"" invasion of Ukraine."
23112	9	"For his part, Emmanuel Macron considered that ""Russia cannot and must not win"" the war in Ukraine. ""Russia cannot and must not win and therefore our support for Ukraine and our sanctions against Russia will continue for as long as necessary and with the necessary intensity over the coming weeks and months,"" he said. said at a press conference after the summit."
23112	11	"The creation of a ""climate club"""
23112	13	"In addition, the leaders of the G7 have agreed on the creation of a ""climate club"" intended to strengthen and broaden cooperation in the fight against global warming, according to a joint declaration published on Tuesday at the end of their summit in Germany. This climate club will be an ""intergovernmental forum of great ambition"" open to all countries, explain the seven leaders. ""We invite our partners, including major emitters, G20 members and other developing and emerging economies, to intensify discussions and consultations with us,"" the statement continued."
23112	15	This body, led by Germany, aims in particular to bring together countries accepting common rules to avoid competitive disadvantages. These countries would jointly set ambitious targets and exempt each other from climate-related trade tariffs to which non-members would be subject. This would include agreeing carbon pricing standards or uniform regulations for green hydrogen.
23112	17	"G7 leaders also accused China on Tuesday of ""practices that distort the global economy"" and said they wanted to cooperate in sharing information on such actions taken by Beijing. ""With regard to China's role in the global economy, we continue to consult on collective approaches, also beyond the G7, to address the challenges posed by non-market policies and practices that distort the economy. world"", they declared in their final press release after a summit where they denounced ""non-transparent and distorting interventions in the Chinese market""."
23112	19	About $14 billion against food insecurity
23112	21	"The seven G7 powers have urged countries and companies with ""large food stocks"" to help ease the food shortage and pledge an additional $4.5 billion to tackle food insecurity."
23112	23	As a short-term remedy, we call on partners who have large stocks of food, as well as the private sector, to make food available without distorting markets, including by supporting the World Food Program's procurement strategy. in a statement by the G7. G7 leaders are also pledging an additional $4.5 billion to address food insecurity, bringing the effort this year to around $14 billion, according to the statement.
23112	25	"The G7 also reiterated its ""urgent call on Russia to end, unconditionally, the blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the destruction of essential port and transport infrastructure, silos and grain terminals, to the illegal appropriation by Russia of agricultural products and equipment in Ukraine and to all other activities that hinder the production and export of production and Ukrainian exports of foodstuffs"". ""These actions can only be seen as a geopolitically motivated attack on global food security,"" the G7 said."
23112	27	The Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the blockade of Black Sea ports, is driving up food prices and contributing to the global spike in inflation. Russia, for its part, denies having blocked the passage of cargo ships and accuses Western sanctions of contributing to the food crisis.
23112	29	After the G7, several heads of state, including Emmanuel Macron, are expected in Madrid for a NATO summit, which takes place from June 28 to 30.
23116	1	In France, guaranteeing abortion without shaking
23116	3	"""I don't think the Supreme Court will ever come back to Roe v. Wade”, declared in 2015 the progressive judge of the institution Ruth Bader Ginsburg, since deceased. However, this is what happened on Friday, when the federal right to abortion was buried by the same Supreme Court. It is always difficult to think of the worst, and that is why democratic countries have a Constitution."
23116	5	This Saturday, the leader of LREM deputies, Aurore Bergé, therefore tabled a constitutional bill to protect access to abortion. Coming from the presidential party and immediately supported by the Prime Minister, Elisabeth Borne, this declaration can make people cringe since LREM had refused in 2018 to register this right when it had been proposed by La France insoumise. Political maneuver then, but what does it matter? The key is to muster the necessary majority in both Houses of Parliament before opponents of women's human rights wake up.
23116	7	"They never sleep, as can be seen from their first reactions this weekend. “I am not for it”, thus declared on BFM TV the president of Modem, François Bayrou, finding “surprising” that what is happening in the United States leads to “effervescent reactions in French political life”. However, this was not his reaction in 1998 to the Monica Lewinsky affair: ""We say:"" It's America! but no democracy is immune to it,” he warned. Same story with Senator LR Bruno Retailleau, accusing the majority of inventing “fictitious problems”. Joining the conservatives, the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut warned this Sunday on Europe 1 of an unexpected strengthening of women's rights, because ""one should only touch the Constitution with a trembling hand"". In 1992, Finkielkraut was part of a group that fought a fierce battle to add an anti-Franglais amendment to the Constitution, with none of his hands shaking. It is now up to the forces of social progress not to tremble."
23119	1	Ukraine: it's no longer a war, it's a butchery
23119	3	We cannot emphasize enough the essential role of war photoreporters who alone make it possible to document the horror, and who moreover have paid a heavy price for this conflict in Ukraine. Sunday, their images looped on the media around the world, attesting to the way in which the Russian military seems to have behaved in the Ukrainian localities liberated after several weeks of occupation. It's no longer a war, it's a butchery. Men executed with their hands behind their backs, women raped then burned, bodies crushed by tanks… The list is long of the abuses that the Russians seem to have committed.
23119	5	Of course, you have to be careful. Since the affair of the true-false mass graves in the Romanian city of Timisoara, in 1989, we know that we must be wary of emotion and images taken on the spot. Investigative work will determine the exact nature of the Russian crimes perpetrated in Ukraine. And if it turns out that tens, hundreds or even thousands of inhabitants of Ukrainian localities controlled by the Russian army were executed with a bullet in the neck or raped, it will be necessary not only to testify in front of the international justice, but also to pass to the top speed of the sanctions.
23119	7	On Sunday, Western condemnations were almost unanimous, suggesting stronger economic reprisals. Yes, it will require sacrifices on our part, but don't these images make them unavoidable? History may be dotted with massacres, but it is still difficult to understand how men can unleash themselves like furious beasts on those who, the day before, were considered brothers or cousins. Vladimir Putin bears a crushing responsibility in this situation, he who heated up, manipulated and then unleashed his men on Ukraine, but also all those around him who know the extent of disinformation and remain silent for fear of reprisals. They need to know that they will pay the price one day.

2312	3	"COP 26 did not end in Glasgow as planned. Its President, the Briton Alok Sharma, had insisted that it was necessary to ""put coal in the history books"", specifying: ""we must stop using coal, and also stop all subsidies to fossil fuels...""."
2312	5	"Everything seemed settled for an uneventful vote, when on Saturday, November 13, an hour before the closing of the conference, an unprecedented event occurred. The representative of India, its Minister of the Environment Bhupender Yadav, declared that his country did not accept the planned wording and proposed another wording as follows: ""We must move towards clean technologies, including by intensifying efforts to phase out coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies…”. The Indian Minister then argued that China supported India's suggestion. Official projections from these countries show that global CO2 emissions will inexorably continue to grow."
23127	3	Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and a delegation of security officials traveled to their country's border on Thursday to mark the completion of a 300 km steel wall along the border with Belarus.
23127	5	In remarks to reporters, Morawiecki used tricks to distract liberals from Poland's selective approach to immigration, which welcomes Ukrainians while rejecting Syrians :
23127	7	“The first sign of the war in Ukraine was the attack of (Belarusian President) Alexander Lukashenko on the Polish border with Belarus. It is thanks to (our) political foresight and anticipation of what might happen that we can now focus on helping Ukraine, which is fighting to protect its sovereignty,” he said. to journalists.
23127	9	Belarus supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, including allowing Russian forces to use Belarusian territory.
23127	11	Lukashenko's 'attack' on Poland took the form of militarized migration, with his government encouraging migrants from the Middle East to come to Belarus and then attempt to enter the European Union through the country's borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The move was seen as a new form of retaliation for EU sanctions against Belarus over its treatment of dissidents.
23127	13	Thousands of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Africa poured into Belarus and made their way to the Polish border, where they endured freezing cold in their quest to cross the border. Sometimes the situation gave rise to major clashes. In November, hundreds of migrants pushed towards the border near the Polish village of Kuznica and tried to undo a barbed wire fence with shovels and other tools.
23127	15	“This is part of the inhuman approach of the Lukashenko regime, which consists of lying to people, abusing them (…) and bringing them to Belarus with the promise of easy entry into the European Union. said an EU spokesperson at the time.
23127	17	"Human rights groups have accused both countries of mistreating migrants. According to the Associated Press, at least 20 people have died in the ""icy forests and bogs"" of the border area."
23127	19	Along with the completion of the wall, the Polish government lifted an emergency declaration that banned journalists and human rights activists from observing the situation along the border.
23127	21	Activists have criticized the Polish government for simultaneously taking in mostly white, Christian and female refugees from Ukraine while refusing mostly Muslim male migrants from elsewhere.
23127	23	“If you give a refugee a lift at the Ukrainian border, you are a hero. If you do it at the Belarusian border, you are a smuggler and you can end up in prison for eight years,” Natalia Gebert, founder of a Polish nongovernmental organization that helps refugees, told AP.
23127	25	"Meanwhile, in another sign of tension between Warsaw and Minsk, the Polish government on Thursday accused Belarus of fostering an ""atmosphere of acquiescence"" to vandalism against Polish graves, Reuters reports:"
23127	27	The Polish Foreign Ministry said unknown persons had recently damaged Polish tombstones and memorials in several places, mainly in Western Belarus, which was part of Poland before World War II and where many Polish soldiers are buried. .
23127	29	The wave of Ukrainian immigration is wreaking havoc in the EU, as evidenced by unemployment figures for Germany released on Thursday. Analysts had expected the number of unemployed to fall by 5,000, but it jumped by 133,000.
23131	3	Some are often bristled or even outraged by Macron's anti-French statements and undue tributes to Algeria, its history... such as the unacceptable work of Benjamin Stora, being only a charge against France.
23131	5	In fact, it would not be about ideology. It would simply be repeated thanks to the Algerian regime for having financed its first campaign, probably in cash… We are talking about 18 million euros… The oligarchs surrounding Bouteflika are now in prison, however the Minister of Foreign Affairs survives, who, like Le Drian, has passed from one president to another... Ramtane Lamara never fails to castigate Macron when he begins to disobey and Foutriquet to ask for forgiveness...
23131	7	"So in February 2017, in the middle of the presidential campaign, Emmanuel Macron went to Algiers. But instead of meeting representatives of civil society, he is content to see officials and, more discreetly, businessmen close to power and qualifies French colonization as a crime against humanity... From then on, he will constantly support the regime , even at the height of the ""Hirak"", when thirteen million Algerians marched throughout Algeria against a fifth term for the old president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Would Emmanuel Macron have offered his protection to a corrupt and discredited military regime, in exchange for financial support?"
23131	9	"This documentary, episode n°6 of the series ""Emmanuel Macron, a businessman at the Élysée"" by Off Investigation, a new left-wing media, does nothing for Foutriquet and puts a number of revelations into perspective, with guest star Alexandre Benalla."

23135	5	An important result, welcomed AFP Victor Madrigal-Borloz, who has held the position since 2017. The defender of the rights of LGBTQI + minorities at the United Nations narrowly obtained the renewal of his mandate, despite the fierce fight of a group of Muslim countries in all UN arenas. Its mission, created in 2016, was renewed last week in Geneva by the Human Rights Council, for an additional three years.
23135	7	Read also: Faced with the neo-reactionary offensive in the world, reaffirm human rights diplomacy
23135	9	"The protection of the rights of sexual and gender minorities is a regular subject of debate at the UN, due to the fierce opposition of certain countries which question the existence of the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, pointed out as contrary to their traditional values ​​and as an obstacle to the universality of human rights. Despite campaign involving ""over 1,100"" LGBTQI+ organizations from 174 countries and ""political support"" from dozens of states, rights advocate says reappointment has faced hostility from Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which defends the interests of Muslim countries at the UN. A group of African and Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Egypt, specifically objected to the use of the terms ""sexual orientation"", ""transgender"" and ""men who have sex with men"". . ""We cannot support efforts to invent new rights on the basis of personal sexual preferences,"" Pakistani Ambassador Khalil Hashmi pleaded to the Human Rights Council, on behalf of 56 states which, except Albania , are all OIC members."

By 23 votes to 17 – Malawi, Eritrea and China joining 14 Muslim countries – the Council finally approved the renewal, after rejecting several amendments aimed at restricting its scope, sometimes with only one vote difference. ""The international community continues to understand the extent of violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or gender diverse people"", welcomed Victor Madrigal-Borloz, castigating ""a very regrettable political position"" of the opposing countries to its mission: ""The discourse of these States (...) constitutes a rejection of their fundamental international human rights obligations: the protection of the peoples under their authority, and of their own nationals, against human rights violations"" ."

23138	1	The American state is destroying the 4th of July
23138	3	By Dan Sanchez.
23138	5	It looks like the struggling US economy will put a damper on 4th of July celebrations this year.
23138	7	The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday:
23138	9	“Throughout America, the 4th of July fireworks will not be set off on the 4th of July. »
23138	11	Some cities and towns are rescheduling their Independence Day fireworks shows due to a shortage of fireworks or workers.
23138	13	And as many media reveal, meals will be much more expensive than last year. The Washington Examiner reports:
23138	15	“The cost of a July 4 barbecue is expected to be 17% higher than last year, according to a market basket survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. This is a figure that exceeds general inflation, since prices are on average 8.6% higher than a year ago, according to the consumer price index. It also represents a major reversal from the small party savings that the Biden White House shamefully touted in 2021 – drawing ridicule from commentators. »
23138	17	It will be harder to celebrate America's birthday when the American dream is on a tightrope. But it will be a good time to reflect on how we got into this predicament.
23138	19	"July 4 is America's Independence Day. It marks our separation from the British Empire: a state which, through ""a long train of abuses and usurpations"" (in the words of our Declaration of Independence), had proved destructive of the individual rights of Americans. . According to the classic liberal creed of America's founders, this was unacceptable, because the only legitimate purpose of a state is to protect the individual rights of the governed."
23138	21	Today, the American state tramples on the rights of Americans to such an extent that the former British rulers seem benevolent in comparison. Especially since the rise of Covid-19, state attacks on freedom and property have turned into an all-out war on production and therefore on our livelihoods.
23138	23	They shut down huge swathes of the economy and locked millions of families in their homes.
23138	25	A massive expansion in public spending shifted much of the country's wealth from private to public control.
23138	27	The Federal Reserve has waged a war on saving and sound investment, and therefore a war on sustainable capital formation.
23138	29	The Biden administration has discouraged labor with stimulus spending and strangled energy production with regulations.
23138	31	And by using our tax money to drag the entire western world into a global economic war with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, the US government has made a terrible and lasting situation worse: it has caused the collapse of trade in food and energy supplies.
23138	33	"As Elon Musk warned in 2020, ""If you don't make anything, there's nothing."" If you prohibit entrepreneurs from opening shops and workers from going to work, there will be less goods. If you ban domestic industries from importing food and fuel, there will be less food and fuel. If you don't have enough energy to produce transportation consumer goods, there will be less consumer goods. Etc."
23138	35	No amount of stimulus financed by Federal Reserve money creation will change that. An electric shock will not make a prisoner work harder if he is handcuffed. Nor can you stimulate an economy chained to prosperity.
23138	37	Now, as an inescapable result, there are far more Federal Reserve Notes for far fewer goods than there otherwise would have been. And that's why the prices are going up.
23138	39	But they're probably not rising as much as they should to fully reflect greater scarcity, due to the ongoing threat of a crackdown on price gouging (as economist Walter Block recently argued here on FEE.org ). And this is one of the main reasons why there are chronic and widespread shortages.
23138	41	Americans have betrayed the legacy of our founding fathers by surrendering the rights they fought for to a tyranny far worse than the one they overthrew, for the false promise of abundance, security and health provided by the 'State. This is why, on this Independence Day, they have less freedom to celebrate and, therefore, less goods and services to do so.
23138	43	To truly honor the founding of America, Americans should begin to act like Americans, declare their independence as individuals, and claim their freedom to cooperate with each other to produce, provide, and prosper.

23148	3	Il Giornale: it is necessary to negotiate Ukraine with Russia before the West gets worse.
23148	5	Western countries must stop supporting the losing Ukraine and bring it to the negotiating table with Russia, in order to avoid the most serious consequences of the confrontation with Russia, writes the columnist of the Italian publication il Giornale Gian Mikalessin .
23148	7	The columnist claims that NATO countries doubted whether they should support Ukraine “as much as necessary” after the capture of Lisichansk by the allied forces of the Russian Federation and the LPR. Mikalessin believes that the Ukrainian armed forces cannot be compared with Russian troops. He also called the illusion that Western weapons in the hands of Ukraine can affect the outcome of the special operation. He recalled the technical complexity of NATO weapons, which the Ukrainians are not able to serve.
23148	9	At the same time, the journalist did not forget the risk of an unprecedented rise in energy prices, which the West so badly needs. Thus, according to JP Morgan forecasts, in the fall, the price of a barrel of oil could reach 380 dollars. At the same time, disagreements are inevitable within NATO on the prospect of a conflict with Russia: at least the Germans, French and Italians will not want to make sacrifices for Ukraine doomed to defeat .

23152	1	Joe Biden and the Saudi Despots: A Very Revealing Submission
23152	3	"Joe Biden's immediate abandonment of his 2020 vow to make Saudis ""outcasts"", and his growing support for the regime, show the fundamental deception of American propaganda."
23152	5	Translated by the readers of the Les-Crises website
23152	7	"In 2018, President Trump issued a statement reaffirming the United States' longstanding relationship with the Saudi royal family, on the grounds that this partnership serves America's ""national interests."" Trump specifically cited the fact that ""Saudi Arabia is the largest oil-producing nation in the world"" and that it has purchased hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons from American arms manufacturers. Trump's statement was released following widespread demands in Washington that Trump reduce or even sever ties with the Saudi regime over the likely role played by its Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, in the brutal killing of the Saudi Arabian regime. Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi."
23152	9	What made these Trump-era demands somewhat odd was that Khashoggi's killing wasn't exactly the first time the Saudi regime had violated human rights and committed atrocities of virtually every kind. For decades, the arbitrary imprisonment and murder of Saudi dissidents, journalists and activists has been commonplace, not to mention the US- and UK-backed devastation of Yemen that began during the Obama years. . All of this took place as post-World War II American presidents made the deep and close partnership between Washington and the tyrants of Riyadh a staple of American policy in the Middle East.
23152	11	"Yet, as was typical of the Trump years, political and media commentators treated Trump's decision to maintain relations with the Saudis as if it were an unprecedented aberration of the evil he alone pioneered. — a radical departure from long-held bipartisan American values ​​— rather than what it was: namely, the pursuit of standard bipartisan American politics for decades. In an outraged op-ed following Trump's statement, The New York Times exclaimed that Trump was making the world ""more [dangerous] by emboldening despots in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere"", specifically blaming ""Trump's opinion according to that all relationships are transactional and that moral or human rights considerations must be sacrificed to a basic understanding of US national interests. »"
23152	13	"The lifelong Eurocrat, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, lamented what he described as Trump's worldview: ""If you buy American weapons and you are against Iran - then you can kill and suppress as much as you want. CNN published an analysis by Stephen Collinson, White House reporter for the channel, under the title: “Saudi support for Trump highlights the brutality of the America First doctrine” – which thundered: “By refusing to break with Saudi strongman Mohammed bin Salman on the Saudi consulate shooting in Istanbul, Trump has effectively told global despots that if they side with him, Washington will turn a blind eye to actions that violate the traditional values ​​of United States. Trump's willingness to do business with the Saudis, Collinson argued, ""represented another blow to the international rule of law and global accountability, concepts that Trump has shown little desire to uphold in nearly two years in office. »"
23152	15	Perhaps the most vocal in criticizing Trump's continued drive to maintain ties with the Saudi regime were then-Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. As a recent CNN compilation of these statements demonstrates: “In the years before they took office, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and many senior officials in their administration were harshly critical of the lack of action of President Donald Trump against Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. »
23152	17	"During a 2019 Democratic primary debate, Biden swore, “We were actually going to make them pay the price, and actually make them the outcasts that they are” (sic), adding that there has “very little social redemption value in the current government in Saudi Arabia. Harris similarly slammed Trump for his ongoing relationship with the Saudis, complaining on Twitter in October 2019 that ""Trump has yet to hold Saudi officials accountable,"" adding, ""Unacceptable: America needs to make it clear that violence towards critics and the press will not be tolerated. »"
23152	19	That Joe Biden was posing as some sort of human rights crusader who would cut ties with the despotic regimes that have long been among America's dearest partners was inherently farcical. As Obama's vice president, Biden played a central role in the foreign policy of that administration, which embraced the world's most barbaric tyrants. Obama was so dedicated to the United States' longstanding partnership with Riyadh that in 2015 he deeply offended India - the world's largest democracy - by abruptly cutting off his visit there to fly to India. Saudi Arabia, along with leaders of both US political parties, to pay tribute to Saudi King Abdullah on his death. To add insult to injury, Obama, as the Guardian put it, boarded his plane for Riyadh “just hours after lecturing in India on religious tolerance and women’s rights. »
23152	21	"The White House's unwavering support under Obama/Biden for the Saudi regime has not been limited to obsequious gestures like these. Their dedication to strengthening the despotic Saudi ruling family was far more important – and deadly. The Obama administration played a vital role in promoting the Saudi attack on Yemen, which has spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In order to appease the Saudis over its deal with Iran, ""the Obama administration has offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons, other military equipment and training, the highest of any U.S. administration in the U.S.-Saudi alliance for 71 years,” Reuters reported in late 2016, months before Obama and Biden left office."
23152	23	Beyond the huge stockpile of sophisticated weapons that Obama/Biden transferred to the Saudis to use against Yemen and anyone they chose to target, Snowden's records revealed that Obama ordered a significant increase in the amount and type of intelligence technology as well as raw intelligence provided by the NSA to the Saudi regime. This intelligence was – and still is – used by Saudi autocrats not only to identify bombing targets in Yemen, but also to subject their own population to close, virtually ubiquitous surveillance: a regime of control used to brutally suppress any dissent or opposition to the Saudi regime.
23152	25	In sum, it is no exaggeration that the White House under Obama/Biden – along with their junior British counterparts – have been singularly responsible for the Saudi regime's ability to survive and wage this devastating war in Yemen. But this is nothing new. The centerpiece of US policy in the Middle East for decades has been to prop up Saudi despots with weapons and diplomatic protection in exchange for the Saudis serving US interests with their oil supply and guaranteeing the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency in the oil market.
23152	27	This is what made the hysterical reaction to Trump's reaffirmation of this relationship so absurd and deliberately misleading. Trump was not savagely deviating from American politics by embracing Saudi bullies, but simply continuing the longstanding American policy of supporting all sorts of savage despots around the world whenever it advanced American interests. US presidents are not supposed to explicitly admit that they overlook human rights abuses of their allies because of the benefits of this relationship, even though this amoral and self-serving approach is and has been for decades one of the premises ideologies of bipartisan American foreign policy.
23152	29	Beyond the Saudi example, the same thing could be observed when Trump welcomed the brutal Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House; the mainstream commentary saw it as a kind of shocking violation of fundamental American principles.
23152	31	"In fact, the United States has been the greatest benefactor of Egyptian tyranny for decades. They armed and supported the Mubarak regime until it was overthrown. Obama's Secretary of State John Kerry has praised General Sisi's military coup against the nation's first democratically elected leader as an attempt to protect democracy. And shortly before the start of the Arab Spring, Hillary Clinton, succeeding Kerry, declared her personal affection for the predecessor of Sisi, the monstrous dictator who ruled Egypt for three decades: ""I really consider the President and Mrs Mubarak as friends of my family, so I hope to see him often here in Egypt and in the United States,” she exclaimed in 2009, as Obama ensured that the flow of money and weapons to Mubarak never stops."
23152	33	While the bipartisan political and media class has spent decades insisting, and still insists, that the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy is to uphold freedom and democracy and fight tyranny around the world , the indisputable reality is the exact opposite: supporting the most brutal dictators on the planet who serve US interests has been a staple of US foreign policy since at least the end of World War II. What determines whether the United States supports or opposes a foreign country is not whether it is democratic or despotic, but whether it is deferential.
23152	35	"Thus, it was not Trump's embrace of long-standing American partnerships with Saudi and Egyptian despots that represented a radical departure from American tradition. The radical deviation was Biden's promise during the 2020 presidential campaign to make Saudis ""outcasts"" and isolate them to punish them for their atrocities. But few in Washington were alarmed by Biden's campaign vow because no one believed Joe Biden ever intended to do so."
23152	37	That's why it's absolutely no surprise, repugnant as it may seem, that Joe Biden was quick to drop this 2020 campaign foreign policy vow on Saudi Arabia at the earliest opportunity. Far from turning Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” state as he promised, Joe Biden has perfectly continued – and even intensified – the American tradition of supporting and strengthening what is quite possibly the most despotic and the deadliest in the world.
23152	39	"Barely a month after Biden's inauguration, the Director of National Intelligence released a long-secret report that announced, ""We believe that Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill” Jamal Khashoggi. Yet the White House, while imposing some mild sanctions on some Saudi individuals, flatly refused to impose any punishments on Crown Prince bin Salman himself."
23152	41	"But that was just the beginning of Biden's support for the Saudi regime. Last November, “the US State Department approved its first major arms sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under President Joe Biden, with the sale of 280 air-to-air missiles worth up to $650 million. of dollars "". Weeks later, the U.S. Senate, Politico reports, ""gave a bipartisan vote of confidence to the Biden administration's proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia, blunting criticism from progressives and some Republicans over the kingdom's involvement in Yemen's civil war and its human rights record. A group of dissidents – led by Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) – have argued that arms sales will fuel the war in Yemen and embolden the Saudi regime, but they were easily swept aside by a bipartisan majority protecting the status quo and led by the leaders of both parties, Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY)."
23152	43	"And now it looks like Biden is planning a pilgrimage to Riyadh to visit his Saudi partners in person. Last week, The New York Times reported that Biden “has decided to visit Riyadh this month to rebuild relations with the oil-rich kingdom, at a time when he seeks to lower gas prices in his country. country and to isolate Russia abroad"". During this trip, ""the president will meet"" bin Salman himself, who, according to Biden's own Director of National Intelligence, oversaw Khashoggi's killing. The justification offered by The New York Times for Biden's planned trip was virtually identical to the arguments used by Trump in 2018: ""The visit represents the triumph of realpolitik over moral outrage, according to foreign policy experts."" »"
23152	45	Indeed, the explanation offered by Biden's Secretary of State for the President's ongoing deal with the Saudis is virtually indistinguishable from the justification offered by Trump that has sparked so much outrage over the downfall of American ideals allegedly caused. by its willingness to do business with undemocratic regimes:
23152	47	“Saudi Arabia is an essential partner for us in the fight against extremism in the region, in managing the challenges posed by Iran, and also, I hope, in continuing the process of building relations. between Israel and its near and more distant neighbors through the continuation, expansion of the Abraham Accords,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Wednesday at an event marking the 100th anniversary of Foreign Affairs magazine. He added that human rights are still important, but “we are addressing all of our interests in this relationship. »
23152	49	"Although, from the start, Biden has clearly abandoned his campaign promise – to keep the United States out of the Saudis – he justifies this move by the need to plead with the Saudis to make more oil available. on the market in order to compensate for the sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia. As the Times puts it: ""Russia and Saudi Arabia are nearly tied as the world's second-largest oil producers, which means that when Biden administration officials sought to cut off supplies to one , they concluded that they could not afford to disagree with each other. After the Times report, Biden officials said the trip had been postponed until July, but did not deny it would take place."
23152	51	What convincing moral argument can be made to say that it is better to buy Saudi oil in order to avoid buying Russian oil? Regardless of one's opinion of the extent of Putin's autocracy in Russia, there is no minimally credible argument to say that it is worse than the systemic tyranny long imposed by the Saudi ruling family. Indeed, it is virtually impossible to dispute that, at least before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, civil liberties were greater in Russia than in Saudi Arabia. And while it can certainly be argued that Russia's three-month war in Ukraine was a moral atrocity, there is no basis – none – to claim that it is worse, on any level. , than the indiscriminate violence and destruction that the Saudis have been unleashing for seven years in Yemen (unless one values ​​the lives of European Ukrainians more than that of non-European Yemenis).
23152	53	And even if one were to insist that absolutely nothing on the planet is worse than the Russian invasion of Ukraine and therefore everything must be done to maintain the sanctions regime imposed on Russia, how does this would dubious moral claim justify turning a blind eye to Saudi atrocities and sending Biden, on his knees, to beg bin Salman for more oil? If stifling and punishing Russia is the highest moral and strategic priority, why wouldn't it be more prudent and more moral for the United States to lift Biden's restrictions on its own domestic drilling as a means of replacing Russian oil? , especially if it avoids further strengthening the Saudi regime?
23152	55	But the one and only value of the US partnership with Saudi Arabia is to tell us the truth. Of course, US foreign policy is not devoted to spreading freedom and democracy, and fighting against despotism and tyranny in the world. How can a country that counts Saudi monarchs, the Egyptian military junta, Qatari slaveholders and Emirati dictators among its closest partners and allies claim without batting an eyelid that it opposes tyranny and wages war to protect the democracy ? The United States does not care at all whether a foreign country is ruled by democracy or tyranny. They care about one question and one question only: Does the government of this country serve or hinder American interests?
23154	1	Borrel: the G20 countries do not share the position of the EU and the G7 on the Ukrainian question
23154	3	Josep Borrel said on his own blog that the G20 countries condemned the Russian special military operation, but refused more drastic measures and statements because of a desire to maintain relations with Russia.
23154	5	The head of European diplomacy Josep Borrel, at the end of the G20 ministerial summit, wrote on his own blog that the position of the States of the European Union and the G7, expressed in the condemnation of Russia for actions in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions, remains unchanged. However, among the members of the G20, this position does not prevail.
23154	7	“In principle, all condemn the attack on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. But when it comes to naming the perpetrator and indicating who is responsible for the consequences, many refrain from doing so for various reasons,” – said Borrel.
23154	9	According to him, for many countries, the economic consequences of the crisis in Ukraine turned out to be more important than questions of responsibility for it. Borel pointed out that in this situation, many want to maintain good relations with Russia and not take someone aside. Russia temporarily closes the main gas pipeline to Europe
23157	1	Hacker RaHDIt accuses US of providing kyiv with satellite images to bomb Russia
23157	3	US intelligence services provide Kyiv with radar data, as well as satellite imagery, including Russian territory, a member of Russian hacker group RaHDIt said on condition of anonymity.
23157	5	“We reliably know that US intelligence services provide Ukrainian intelligence with satellite images, radar data, including satellite images of Russian territory, where, in fact, Ukrainian missiles and shells are arriving. The fact that their radar detection systems work in the interests of Ukrainian intelligence, we also see that,” he said in an interview with RIA Novosti.
23157	7	The interlocutor of the agency said that for such strikes it is necessary to have accurate information, as well as to know the location of the targets.
23157	9	Earlier today, it was reported that Russian hacker group RaHDit and Ukrainian “Beregini” obtained secret operational documents from the Ukrainian military.
23157	11	According to one of the RaHDit participants, the “Beregini” group helps hackers get real-time information. He explained that the group is helped by their friends who serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).
23157	13	In addition, one of the hackers from the RaHDit group said that the losses of the Ukrainian armed forces today are at least 50-70 thousand killed.
23157	15	Prior to this, on July 8, it was reported that the hacker group RaHDit had distributed new data on employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GID) of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as on those involved. . The documents contain information on 2,500 people. This is primarily information on the criminal backgrounds of DIU officers, which include those convicted of robbery, illegal arms and drug trafficking, grievous bodily harm, and rape.
23157	17	At the same time, hackers released the first part of the collected data on July 6. To access the data, the RaHDit group used flaws in the protection of GUR networks, as well as methods of analyzing Big Data from characteristic patterns of user behavior.
23157	19	On June 8, hacker RaHDIt said disagreements had begun to arise between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office and the Ukrainian Armed Forces Command over the conduct of hostilities. According to him, for this reason, the Ukrainian army suffered heavy losses.
23157	21	Commentary note: The question is not whether this information is true or not – and it is undoubtedly true – but to note that Russia agrees to divulge such information which practically forces it in the eyes of all to put down American observation satellites, as it had once shot down a U2 which was flying over its territory.
23160	1	Ukraine declares war on the opposition: a certain vision of “democracy”
23160	3	"For Karine Bechet-Golovko, doctor of public law, the “globalist” camp cannot afford to support Ukraine in the name of democracy and the rule of law, given the treatment reserved by Kyiv for the opposition . Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind the war of civilization waged by the global world in Ukraine against Russia. The speech affirms it: post-Maidan Ukraine is democratic, certainly imperfect, but has made the choice of democracy. This is not discussed, it is supported. The global world therefore supports Ukraine. As we can read in Le Monde at the end of March this year: “However imperfect and messy it may be, Ukrainian democracy exists, and it constitutes a precious rarity in the post-Soviet space of Eastern Europe.” Democracy in Ukraine is the slogan behind the war of civilization waged by the global world in Ukraine against Russia. And the institutions of the global world all support this democratic path. NATO asserted without batting an eyelid ten days ago that “a sovereign, independent and stable Ukraine, firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law, is essential to Euro-Atlantic security. "". As for the Council of Europe, it is collaborating with the Ukrainian Ministry of Communities and Territorial Development, so that European principles dominate the Ukrainian territorial organization - in any case, as we learned at the beginning of June: ""From the beginning of the war, the Center of Expertise for Good Governance has provided assistance to Ukrainian national and local authorities, [...] aimed at raising awareness of the main challenges facing Ukrainian regions and municipalities and at facilitating an exchange with their peers from other European countries."
23160	5	"If this globalist media-institutional frenzy for ""Ukrainian democracy"" mainly serves to justify the unconditional support that the global world demands of Ukraine, what about the political-legal reality of the country of this famous ""post-democracy""? -Maidan”? The stability and sincerity of a democratic system are measured by the respect it gives to the opposition. No democratic system is perfect, but when there is a rotation of political forces, when a majority knows that sooner or later it will inevitably end up in opposition, it has every interest in granting rights to this opposition, in order to eventually return to power. Generally speaking, the quality of a country's governance depends a lot on the quality of its opposition, because the latter forces the majority to improve, at least out of self-interest, so as not to lose power, if not. is by conviction. However, while the mysteries of the global world congratulate each other, pat each other on the shoulder, gloat about “Ukrainian democracy”, this same post-Maidan Ukraine has literally declared war on its opposition. Without a legal basis then, the National Security and Defense Council declared on March 18, 2022 the suspension for the duration of the military operation of no less than 11 opposition political parties. The legal basis was formed later, starting from May 3, when the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, amended certain legislative provisions in force by expanding the grounds on which it is possible to prohibit the establishment and activity of a political party, in particular to ""the justification or negation of Russian aggression, or its presentation as an internal conflict"". Then, on May 14, President Zelensky signed the law on the liquidation of declared pro-Russian parties. Thus, the decision of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council can be legitimized before the courts, perfectly submitted, since it has already been the subject of a drastic post-Maidan purge. The judicial ball of the Lvov Court of Appeal (in Western Ukraine, precisely) was opened on June 8, with the banning of the “Opposition Bloc” party. Then, on June 13, the court banned two parties, the “Socialists” and “Justice and Development”. They are all small parties, not very active and not very representative. But the beautiful “Ukrainian democracy” has moved into high gear and on June 16, it bans the party of the opponent and emblematic blogger Sharii. On June 20, the serious things begin with the banning of the first parliamentary party, “Opposition Platform – For Life”. Others are still awaiting bans, but already questions are being asked. The Ukrainian globalist media, like Unian, are worried: what to do with the elected representatives of these banned parties? Because they not only risk being able to reorganize an opposition party later, but they continue to exercise their parliamentary mandate... Which is obviously a shame in post-Maidan democratic Ukraine, to let elected parliamentarians opposition fully exercise their mandate... The irony is pushed to its maximum. These banned parties can appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine. But what are the real chances of an objective re-examination of their situation, when we know that the repressive machine is racing and going ever further, with a bill requiring the prohibition for the members of these parties to be eligible in any electoral function, at any level? Not stopping there, a bill is under discussion, amending art. 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the Rada, in order to limit the constitutional rights of opposition deputies, blocking their access to working and investigative committees and commissions. The Ukrainian globalists hide and justify themselves by ""war"", unable to recognize the totalitarian character of their approach. It is, for example, possible to read this: ""The situation in which the former representatives of recognized pro-Russian political forces in the context of the war with Russia continue to exercise the powers of Ukrainian people's deputies is not only absurd , but also poses a potential threat to state security”. However, in the same article, a few sentences above, it is specified that the need to ban so-called “pro-Russian” political parties existed before February 24. The argument of war is indeed an excuse, not a reason. The problem is much more general: since the Maidan of 2014, the Ukrainian system can no longer afford political pluralism, this political pluralism which, after the first external coup of the Orange Revolution of 2004, allowed the return to a political internal peace towards Russia and thus nullified all these international efforts of 2004. Lessons have been learned, mistakes have not been repeated, ""post-Maidan democracy"" can only be a block, leaving no room for the alternative. However, this poses real legal problems, and the international community, knowing this, piously keeps silent on these liberticidal excesses, in order to protect the discourse of a “democratic” Ukraine. Because, by closing parliamentary political parties, Ukraine is directly undermining the regular functioning of the institutions and the regularity of the legislative texts adopted. Ukraine cannot at the same time be at war, and therefore be able to justify all attacks on the regular functioning of institutions, and be democratic and respectful of the rule of law. But the global world cannot afford to officially support, in the name of democracy and the rule of law, a country that openly flouts both democracy and the rule of law."
23161	1	Europe: who has an escape plan? What is it?
23161	3	Deplorable sequence at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Let's move on to this grotesque choreography of little interest. Ursula von der Leyen, who chairs the Commission of the European Union, wants the unanimity rule to end in certain key areas where it is still required, and the treaties would therefore have to be modified[1]. The areas where this unanimity is still required are diplomacy and defence; legal-police cooperation; Taxation ; expansion to other countries; the budget ; social harmonization; citizenship and treaty changes. This is of course to make Europe more efficient and independent. Emmanuel Macron is in favor of it and intends to devote a Council of Europe summit to this question at the end of June[2]. Fortunately, countries have made their hostility to this idea known.
23161	5	We had already had the compulsory vaccination mentioned by this unelected president, and her untimely interventions on the Ukrainian conflict. There, we have the confession: the European technocratic structure wants to govern alone, in defiance of the sovereignty of the nations that form Europe and of subsidiarity.
23161	7	Born of a French father and a German mother who met after the war, having worn the uniform of the Scouts of Europe and having studied at the European Business School, I should logically join the European project. I can not. I can not anymore.
23161	9	The European Union has ceased to be democratic, and for a long time. The European currency was conceived as not being able to derogate from a liberal monetarist policy based on a doxa making inflation the irremissible sin. That this choice cannot be challenged by citizens is undemocratic. In 2008, there is the Treaty of Lisbon which followed the rejection by referendum of the European Constitutional Treaty of 2005. Nicolas Sarkozy, his ministers and the parliamentarians who participated in this abomination should be prosecuted for this high treason[3].
23161	11	Is it the European Union that requires us French not to be democratic either? The ousting of François Asselineau, the only somewhat serious Frexit candidate in the last presidential election, suggests this.
23161	13	The European Union has become a convenient structure for pooling lobbies. Witness, for example, the opacity of the commission which redacts to make them illegible the vaccine supply contracts concluded by an executive in conflict of interest. As if by chance, it is the American-inspired lobbies that successfully promote the interests of their constituents.
23161	15	The European Union is now aligned without any retreat on the aggressive and bellicose positions of an outdated NATO, brain dead, subservient to the interests of the sellers of American guns and a senile and corrupt president.
23161	17	Do you remember the story of the Syrian princess who climbs on Jupiter disguised as a white bull, kidnaps her and rapes her? The brutality remains the same. It is time for the damsel to fight back, and the damsel is us, the European peoples. I remain convinced that the peoples of Europe will only be able to build this area of ​​peace, prosperity and cooperation by getting rid of the tutelage of Washington and agreeing to conceive of themselves as far as the Urals or perhaps Kamchatka. The preliminary step is to tear down this toxic European Union.
23171	1	Paris 2024: the Olympic Games final bouquet for a France in crisis
23171	3	The Olympic Games were to be a celebration, a sort of 1998 bis World Cup intended to make France and its political elites shine internationally. In a few years of political, health and economic crises, the pharaonic project for Paris has turned into a sword of Damocles suspended above the heads of Anne Hidalgo and Emmanuel Macron.
23171	5	Anne Hidalgo devotes herself to the Olympic Games with application after her spectacular disappointment in the presidential election. Although re-elected to the mayor of Paris in June 2020, she gathered on her name only 1.7% of French voters and 2.2% of Parisian voters during the presidential campaign.
23171	7	Awaiting media success
23171	9	Emmanuel Macron for his part was poorly re-elected President of the Republic against the foil candidate Marine Le Pen. Weakened in the legislative elections, he is, like Anne Hidalgo, in search of the political and communicational operation of magnitude that will put him back on track.
23171	11	The two elected officials therefore hope that the Olympics will bring significant political benefit: if the media success is there, they will be able to return to the front of the stage not only nationally, but worldwide. No doubt they still have in mind the triumph of Boris Johnson as mayor of London, carried by the Olympic Games organized in 2012.
23171	13	However, organizing the Olympic Games is a costly operation, not to say ruinous, when it cannot be absorbed thanks to the good economic health of the host country.
23171	15	In 1992, for the Winter Olympics in Albertville, the State provided approximately 3 billion francs to modernize local infrastructure in order to improve communications between the municipalities hosting the 57 Olympic events. The idea, classically Keynesian, obviously aimed to boost demand through public investment.
23171	17	The previous Albertville
23171	19	After the Games, life in Albertville resumed its course and the Court of Auditors estimated the deficit of the operation at 279 million francs in 1993. Contrary to a received technocratic idea, which seems to have survived the Albertville fiasco, this It is not the public expenditure linked to the Olympic Games that attracts investors, but the investors already there – a sign of the country's good economic health – which make it possible to absorb these huge drains of public money, as in London in 2012.
23171	21	As Henry Hazlitt reminded us in his fundamental book Economics in one lesson, we must bear in mind that all public expenditure is financed by taxation, that is to say by the forced transfer of resources from taxpayers to certain social groups. As a result, the “creation of wealth by spending” is preceded by a destruction of wealth by state coercion, which makes the exercise economically dubious.
23171	23	The mayor of Paris has multiplied its debt by 200% in 20 years, reaching more than 7 billion in 2021. For its part, the debt of the French State has increased by 600 billion under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron. According to a recent report, on the eve of the Olympics, the town hall is unable to resolve the serious problem of insecurity which plagues the capital (like the rest of the country). For its part, the State has not really shone on the subject as we have seen with its catastrophic management of the incidents at the Stade de France.
23171	25	With the conflict in Ukraine, it is now the risk of inflation that risks causing the costs of a budget limited for the moment to 4 billion euros to explode.
23171	27	Emmanuel Macron and Anne Hidalgo hope to recover their political health with the Olympics, but all the indicators are red. It is exactly the opposite that could happen: the veil of political and media communication could be torn to reveal to the world that France is the real sick man of Europe.
23172	1	All the decisions of Emmanuel Macron's health policy have cost more than 600 billion, for what result?
23172	3	The sanitary slate is about 600 billion. In addition to containment, vaccinations also represent a few billion. 146 million doses were administered for a price between 15 and 20 euros per dose depending on the period. Vaccination alone cost between 2.3 and 2.8 billion euros.
23172	5	Regarding the tests, badly named anti-Covid, the simple month of December and its 28 million tests cost health insurance a billion euros. The Minister of Public Accounts acknowledged a month later that the anti-Covid tests cost 1.5 billion for the month of January. Two months of tests cost 2.5 billion, what for? Health policy therefore represents a hysteria of more than 600 billion euros.
23172	7	An amnesiac finance minister
23172	9	And we hear a Minister of Finance speak of a “coast of alert” with nearly 3,000 billion euros in debt, or 114.5% of GDP. Can he account for his responsibility and his results since he has contributed to his abyssal growth? We were in 2017 at 2,200 billion and 98% of GDP. Can he explain the efficiency ratio of this unprecedented expenditure in the economic history of France?
23172	11	The concrete value of this crazy expense
23172	13	Let us take the measure of this staggering health expenditure. Remember that the annual operation of a departmental hospital is estimated in the range of 250 to 350 million euros. There are therefore 2,000 hospitals operating for one year or 100 departmental hospitals operating for 20 years. 600 billion is 15 years of the defense budget (just under 40 billion in 2021) or ten years of the national education budget (55 billion in 2021). Such a sacrifice never committed in the public expenditure of France requires a fast and perfect result, at the height of the expense and the promises exposed as certainties of faith by all the specialists, right? We all remember the aggressiveness, the scientism of certainties, the arrogance and contempt of Minister Véran in particular. 600 billion for what?
23172	15	The nullity of the result
23172	17	However, has this incredible expense achieved a commensurate result, namely the rapid eradication of the virus? No, since we are talking about a 7th wave, that people are still dying from this disease, even if fortunately, it is not thousands a day. But did this initial confinement free us from the disease? No. The 2nd containment? No. Did the vaccination work? No, since today the figures show that the sick are vaccinated as well as hospitalized. Charlatanism, scam? And were the tests helpful? Neither, since the disease remains. So what were these 600 billion in public spending used for? And we do not currently have the ability to measure the cost of adverse effects. It is likely to be high.
23172	19	The democratic freedom of inventory of responsibilities
23172	21	Is it possible in a free and democratic society to ask our newly elected officials to open a transparent, even popular commission of inquiry, to demand answers on the responsibilities of these colossal spending commitments? There are several issues here. That of never reproducing such madness. That of sanctioning the ministers, even the President at the height of this absolute madness. Finally, that of settling this expenditure with financial measures and sanctions against those who have benefited, even corrupted: European Union, laboratories, shareholders of laboratories, complicit States, etc.
23172	23	The major challenge is to free oneself from this irrational grip of a few on the destiny of the greatest number.
23172	25	They demonstrated that they knew nothing.
23172	27	We now have proof that the expenditure was irrational, irrelevant and today without result. There is an urgent need for a radical paradigm shift. That's progress, right? At least, it is an obligation before asking the French to sacrifice themselves again when it is necessary to settle this debt by recovering it from the authors of this hysteria.
23182	1	Thanks to the rebate at the pump, inflation should settle down at the start of the school year
23182	3	In July, consumer prices increased by 6.1% over one year, INSEE said on Friday. According to economists, France could avoid an inflation peak of 7%, in particular thanks to the rebate at the pump increased to 30 centimes in September. The deterioration in the international situation would also play in favor of a lull in the labels.
23182	5	No respite for inflation, but grounds for hope for the future. In July, consumer prices soared 6.1% over one year, after rising 5.8% in June, according to the provisional estimate published on Friday by INSEE. Unheard of since the mid-1980s.
23182	7	Inflation spreads throughout the economy. It is increasingly affecting services, the prices of which rose by 3.9% over one year, manufactured goods (+2.9%) and food products. Over one year, the latter are now recording a price increase of 6.7%, which is more than general inflation.
23182	9	Still up nearly 29%, energy prices are nonetheless slowing down, reflecting the recent drop in oil prices. Over one month, consumer prices increased by only 0.3% against +0.7% in June, also calmed down by the discounts offered during the sales. A harbinger of a possible lull.
23182	11	The positive impact of the 30 cent rebate
23182	13	"Today, economists also think that the rise in prices in France will stop accelerating. ""The law on purchasing power and the probable easing of oil prices given the international situation should allow France to avoid an inflation peak of 7% in September"", assures Ana Boata, director of economic research at Allianz Trade."
23182	15	"While the ""tariff shield"" on energy prices, as well as the rebate at the pump, already allow France to have lower inflation than the other countries of the euro zone, the reinforcement of the rebate at the pump of 18 cents to 30 cents in September could also have a noticeable effect."
23182	17	“If this measure materializes, it could lower the level of inflation by a few tenths of a point,” calculates Julien Pouget, chief economist at INSEE. “The impact of the 18-cent discount had been assessed at 0.4 points less on the overall annual shift in prices, in April and May,” he recalls.
23182	19	"The deterioration of the international situation - contraction of American activity, slowdown in China and Germany - should also help to calm prices. ""Oil prices have calmed down a bit, and could possibly continue to fall, against a backdrop of fairly uncertain global economic prospects"", confirms the INSEE economist, also pointing to ""an already perceptible relaxation in the prices of wheat and certain raw materials. And “the business tendency surveys show a slowdown in expectations of price increases in industry,” he adds."
23183	3	"""Super Mario"", as he was called since the bailout of the euro, resigned from the presidency of the Italian Council. For ""La Story"", the current affairs podcast of ""Les Echos"", Michèle Warnet and her guests decipher the new political crisis that Italy is going through and what it augurs for the future."
23183	5	Political thunderbolt in Italy. Mario Draghi has resigned as President of the Council, dropped by the coalition he had formed only 17 months ago. It included its allies from the League and Forza Italia but also the 5-Star Movement. His package opens a new political crisis in Italy. It also occurs in a tense socio-economic and geopolitical context. The departure of Draghi dismays the European Union but is undoubtedly celebrated in the Kremlin which has loyal allies among the Italian populists, such as Matteo Salvini.
23183	7	"Already, all the opponents of ""Super Mario"", this nickname which he inherited by saving the euro zone in 2012, have thrown themselves into the campaign. The legislative elections scheduled for spring 2023 have been brought forward to the end of September and they will take place at the worst time for Italy. The country must reduce its dependence on Russian gas and carry out difficult reforms to receive funds from the European recovery plan."
23183	9	Recovery plan
23185	3	"A concentrate of diplomatic language after a controversial meeting. The day after the dinner organized at the Elysée between Emmanuel Macron and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed ben Salmane, the Elysée returned this Friday to the content of their exchanges. Apart from the reception of ""MBS"" on Wednesday evening by the Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire, his stay in his castle in Yvelines and the images of a long handshake with the French head of state on the steps of the Elysée, nothing filtered from this meeting."
23185	5	"According to the press release from the presidency, the two men “expressed the wish to deepen the relationship between the two countries and to continue their consultation to meet regional and global challenges, in particular the fight against global warming and its consequences”. For his part, ""MBS"" underlines, in a message addressed to Emmanuel Macron, his ""deep gratitude"" and his ""thanks for the warm welcome and hospitality"" which were reserved for him during this official visit."
23185	7	The question of human rights “addressed”
23185	9	"This visit by the son of King Salman was the first in the European Union since the assassination, on October 2, 2018, of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Critic of Saudi power, the journalist was sordidly murdered in the premises of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul when he came to get the papers necessary for his marriage. According to the American intelligence services, it was ""MBS"" who ordered this assassination. Bin Salman's trip to Paris was strongly criticized by part of the political class, when two human rights NGOs filed a complaint for ""complicity in torture"" and ""enforced disappearance"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of Jamal Khashoggi, for her part said she was “scandalized and outraged” by the reception reserved for the Saudi prince by the French head of state."
23185	11	"In a laconic sentence, at the very end of the press release, the Elysée assures that ""as part of the dialogue of trust between France and Saudi Arabia, the President of the Republic has addressed the issue of human rights in Arabia"". Before the official dinner, the entourage of the Head of State had indicated that this question would be addressed “in a general way” but also around “individual cases”. Emmanuel Macron had already been the first Western leader to visit Saudi Arabia after the death of Jamal Khashoggi, during a tour of the Gulf countries, in December 2021."
23185	13	"While the war in Ukraine is still largely on Emmanuel Macron's international agenda, the latter expressed his ""deep concern"" in particular at ""its disastrous impact on civilian populations and its repercussions on food security"", according to the press release from the Château. The dinner menu included the sensitive issue of gas supplies to European countries."
23185	15	The Elysée tenant insisted in front of his host on “the importance” of initiating the “diversification of energy supplies” for the countries of the European Union. While Russian gas deliveries are down sharply, European capitals are increasing bilateral exchanges with other producing states (Algeria, Qatar and Azerbaijan in particular), in order to find alternative sources of supply.
23185	17	The war in Syria and Yemen on the menu of the meeting
23185	19	"The discussion between the two leaders also revolved around ""means of continuing coordination in the fight against terrorism and the preservation of security"", specifies the Elysée. While “MBS” has initiated vast reforms and major projects in Saudi Arabia, such as the futuristic megalopolis called “Neom”, Emmanuel Macron also wanted to defend Thursday evening the “availability of French companies to support this transformation”. If the fields of energy transition and transport are cited by the Elysée, no signature of a possible contract between Paris and Riyadh has, for the time being, been announced by Paris. In a press release, the Saudi authorities specified that “the means of deepening the investment partnership” between the two countries in the fields of renewable energies and in particular hydrogen were discussed."
23185	21	"Another subject of Thursday evening's discussions was the Iranian nuclear issue. Since March, talks to revive the 2015 deal have stalled. This agreement aimed to lift Western sanctions targeting Tehran in return for strict control of its nuclear program. After an interview on Saturday July 23 with Iranian President Ebrahim Raïsi, Emmanuel Macron estimated that the relaunch of this agreement “was still possible”, provided that it intervenes “as soon as possible”. On this file, the French head of state intends to ""promote dialogue and regional integration"" and pushes the idea of ​​​​a new meeting in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, by the end of the year and modeled on the conference organized in August 2021. The Saudi side referred to “international efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon” and “to pacify the Iranian nuclear program”."
23185	23	With his Saudi counterpart, the President of the Republic finally addressed the situation in Lebanon, reiterating his desire to “strengthen” “cooperation” with Saudi Arabia, particularly on the humanitarian level. The case of Syria, and in particular the North-East of the country, where fighting opposes Kurdish fighters to Turkey, was also mentioned. The Elysée tenant reiterated his “attachment to the ceasefire” in the region.
23185	25	"The Head of State also took advantage of this dinner to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The war in Yemen, finally, where Saudi Arabia at the head of a coalition is fighting the Houthi rebels, is one of the subjects discussed, according to the Elysée. The Head of State ""welcomed the efforts of Saudi Arabia in favor of a political, global and inclusive solution under the aegis of the United Nations and expressed his wish that the truce be extended""."
23188	1	United States: Not everything is a national emergency
23188	3	In the United States, if the National Emergency Act is not reformed, presidents will continue to abuse it to pressure Congress.
23188	5	After Senator Joe Manchin (elected Democrat in West Virginia) rejected his own party's climate legislation, President Joe Biden said:
23188	7	“Action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever. So let me be clear: if the Senate does not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to address it. »
23188	9	"On Monday night, citing three unnamed sources, The Washington Post revealed what that action could be: ""Biden is considering declaring a national climate emergency,"" and it could happen ""as soon as this week."""
23188	11	"According to the Washington Post, activists believe a national emergency would allow Biden ""to halt crude oil exports, limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters, and direct agencies, including the Federal Agency emergency management, boosting renewable energy sources."
23188	13	While political realities — especially high gas prices and inflation — and the inevitable Republican lawsuits may hold Biden back, activists are right to say that emergency declarations are a powerful power booster. presidential.
23188	15	And that's the problem. Emergency declarations have become a lazy political fallback, a way for presidents to circumvent Congress when it hasn't done its job or, in some cases, outright rejected what the president wants. National emergencies have become an escape from administrative anarchy, and they are in dire need of reform.
23188	17	The National Emergencies Act
23188	19	In their current form, emergencies are governed by the National Emergencies Act 1976.
23188	21	Presidents since Jimmy Carter have declared 75 emergencies invoking the authority of this law, and about half of those declarations, many of which are now decades old, remain in effect today.
23188	23	Some of them relate to situations (the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, for example) that can rightly be described as national emergencies.
23188	25	Others are clearly not, such as those sanctioning people who undermine democracy in Zimbabwe and Belarus, two emergencies initially declared during the administration of George W. Bush and renewed by Mr. Biden. However serious these situations are for the people of Zimbabwe and Belarus, they do not constitute emergencies for the United States, and Congress could have acted if it had wanted to.
23188	27	Climate change is of more obvious importance to our country and may well be an emergency in the colloquial sense of the word. But in terms of its legal status, Mr. Biden's wording of the threat gives us a clue: If the Senate doesn't move, he says, the administration will act for it. But the whole point of a declaration of emergency is that it allows the federal government to act when Congress doesn't have time to do so. Congress has had a year and a half of Democratic Trio governance to act on climate change and hasn't done it the way Mr. Biden wants. Yes, that is primarily Manchin's fault, much to the frustration of his fellow Democrats. Alas for them, Manchin is in Congress, and the problem here is simply not Congress's lack of opportunity to act.
23188	29	As former Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash argued:
23188	31	“An emergency does not spark endless debate without consensus, nor is it approached with a plan that takes years to execute. A house burns, a boat sinks, a city floods – these situations are considered emergencies precisely because everyone agrees they require immediate action. »
23188	33	National emergency declarations are not made when a senator does not want to vote as the president wants. Nor is it a tool of presidential blackmail aimed at forcing the legislature to comply with the demands of the executive. For all its openness to presidential abuse, the National Emergencies Act was not intended to completely reverse the Constitution's conception of how federal action should take place. Unfortunately, recent presidents have realized how emergency declarations can be used for this purpose.
23188	35	Biden's attempt to force the Senate on climate change is remarkably reminiscent of former President Donald Trump's threat in 2019 to declare a national emergency in order to secure funds to build his long-promised border wall.
23188	37	Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice in The Atlantic wrote that:
23188	39	“Trump might think that Congress' repeated failure to provide funds shows the need for emergency action. The truth is exactly the opposite. By giving Congress time to definitively establish his refusal to fund the border wall, Trump both removes any legitimate justification for emergency action and proves his intent to subvert the constitutional balance of power. »
23188	41	Change a few words and the same criticism applies to Biden and climate change.
23188	43	Until the National Emergencies Act is reformed, presidents will continue to abuse it to pressure Congress, as Trump and Biden have done.
23188	45	The law needs to be amended to strictly limit the reasons for and duration of such declarations and to define more precisely the scope and nature of the issues that such declarations can address, as well as the length of time that the state of emergency can continue without the approval of the president's plan by Congress.
23188	47	This time frame should be short enough – a few days, perhaps, instead of the current six months – so that lawmakers are forced to consider emergency measures on their own merits rather than automatically approving programs. well-established feds. If this is truly an emergency, even our legislators should be able to come together to act.
2319	1	Russia will not allow outbreak of World War III, says Medvedev
2319	3	Mr. Medvedev, vice-president of the Security Council, declared that Russia will not allow the outbreak of a third world war.
2319	5	Russia will not allow the outbreak of a third world war and, in the event of an attack, it is ready to react accordingly, said Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.
2319	7	“The arsenal of modern, reliable and effective weapons today chills the ambitions of those who are ready to start World War III with their own hands and those of others. We will not allow such a situation. But we are obliged to remind you constantly that in the event of an attack on our country, we are able to give an immediate and superpowerful response. Repel any desire for aggression that threatens our state, ”he wrote on his Telegram channel.
2319	9	On Tuesday, he visited the Institute of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics of the RFNC-VNIIEF in Sarov and held a meeting on the prospects for the development of the National Center for Physics and Mathematics.
23190	3	Droughts, extreme heat waves and major fires are now affecting the whole world. Many cities broke their summer temperature record this summer. Despite international efforts to combat global warming, perhaps we have already reached a point of no return? What if we fail to keep rising temperatures below +2°C? In this eventuality, scientists are working on “last chance” solutions, geoengineering solutions that would limit the damage or even reverse climate change.
23190	5	Geoengineering brings together all the techniques that make it possible to manipulate the Earth's climate and environment. Inspired by an idea suggested by astronomer Robert Angel, an MIT team is currently working on a concept of a solar shield, whose role would be to attenuate the solar radiation that reaches our planet. Indeed, if efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions prove insufficient to reverse climate change, it would already be essential to act directly on our main source of heat.
23190	7	"The project, called ""Space Bubbles"", consists of a kind of giant raft composed of frozen bubbles (roughly the size of Brazil according to the team), which would be positioned at the Lagrange point L1, between the Sun and the Earth. . The structure would be designed to reflect some of the sunlight. The advantage of this approach over other geoengineering projects — such as dissolving chemicals in the stratosphere to increase its albedo — is that it wouldn't directly impact Earth's biosphere."
23190	9	Thin-film bubbles directly inflated in space
23190	11	"When it comes to geoengineering, solar geoengineering has been little explored. In 1989, James Early presented in the journal of the British Interplanetary Society a concept of a ""thin glass shield"" to compensate for the greenhouse effects caused by the accumulation of CO2. This shield was to be constructed from lunar materials and positioned at the first Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system in order to absorb some of the radiation. Such a shield would decrease incident light by 1.8% — enough to reverse current warming. There were issues at the time with the amount of material needed to make this giant sun visor and the energy needed to launch it to its destination."
23190	13	From this work, Roger Angel envisioned in 2006 not one, but several small solar shields. This swarm of shields would aim to deflect some of the light rather than absorb it, in order to minimize the equilibrium shift of L1 caused by radiation pressure, the scientist explained at the time. Despite a reduced mass compared to James Early's project and the implementation of electromagnetic acceleration to escape Earth's gravity, followed by ion propulsion (to limit transport costs), the manufacture and deployment of this swarm of sun visors remained very complex.
23190	15	A few other ideas have since emerged, but none have made it past the rough feasibility study stage. As we gradually move towards a state of climate emergency, a team from MIT has taken another look at Angel's proposal: it proposes to deploy a set of bubble rafts, made up of networks of small interconnected inflatable bubbles near the Lagrange point L1. “We believe that swelling thin-film spheres directly in space from a homogeneous molten material – like silicon – can provide the variation in thickness that refracts a broader wave spectrum and allows us to avoid the need to cast large structural film elements,” the researchers explain.
23190	17	A shield that could be in place before the end of the century
23190	19	It is a question here of manufacturing the reflective spheres directly in space, which would limit transport costs. The solution would also be completely reversible: the bubbles could be destroyed simply by breaking their surface equilibrium, which would also minimize space debris compared to other approaches. It could therefore be one of the most efficient thin-film structures for deflecting solar radiation.
23190	21	It remains to determine the appropriate material and technology to manufacture and maintain such spheres in space. The team has already tested the manufacture of bubbles in the laboratory, under the conditions of outer space; they are particularly interested in silicon-based molten mixtures and graphene-enhanced ionic liquids, which have ultra-low vapor pressures and relatively low densities. The thermal and optical properties of the materials will also be taken into account for the feasibility study.
23190	23	According to the researchers, the minimum thickness of the liquid film forming the bubbles can theoretically be as low as 20 nanometers; but to deflect sunlight, it must be comparable to solar wavelengths, around 400 to 600 nanometers. Eventually, the bubble raft would have a mass density of less than 1.5 g/m2. Its optimal location would be a little closer to the Sun, about 2.5 million kilometers from Earth, to reduce radiation pressure.
23190	25	Several questions remain to be studied before considering the realization of such a project. In particular, you have to think about the maintenance of the shield once in place, because the bubbles will be particularly fragile. It is also essential to reflect on the impact that the reduction of solar radiation will have on our planet and on the transition phase that will be necessary both when the shield is put in place and when it is eliminated when it is not more useful. According to preliminary studies, 50 to 200 years of activity will be needed to reverse the effects of global warming.
23190	27	An estimate by Roger Angel puts the cost of such a project at around 0.5% of global GDP over 50 years. If preliminary laboratory experiments prove successful, further research will be aimed at improving its design and tests will be carried out in low orbit. “We believe that once a technical solution is identified, its implementation could take place before the end of the century”, estimate the researchers.
23192	1	“We will not solve the problem of insecurity until we deal with that of immigration”
23192	3	The delegate of the Institute for Justice Pierre-Marie Sève declares in Le Figaro:
23192	5	In Angers, on the night of July 15 to 16, three young people were stabbed to death. After intervening to defend a young girl victim of sexual assault, these three young people, one of whom was a minor, were killed by a Sudanese refugee armed with a butcher's knife. The day before, a homeless man was killed with a knife in Amiens, by two Tunisians in an irregular situation. A few days earlier, a 46-year-old Montpellier woman was attacked and injured with a knife by an Eritrean, also in an irregular situation. It is difficult not to see a link between the foreign origin of the perpetrators of these attacks and this particular modus operandi of the knife attack. Indeed, if this link is not systematic, foreigners, who represent less than 10% of the population, are clearly overrepresented among perpetrators.
23192	7	"The knife attack is also very strongly linked to Islamic terrorism. The Islamic State had thus made it one of its specialties. Just last Christmas, a plan for a knife attack had, for example, been foiled by the French intelligence services. Another example: in 2019, in an infamous Islamic State propaganda video viewed hundreds of thousands of times, a terrorist called for killing the French on their soil with these words: ""No need for an assault rifle or a handgun, a simple bladed weapon is sufficient"". Finally, this exacerbated violence had reached a peak during the assassination of Samuel Paty, beheaded with a knife. While the government has just announced its desire to deport foreign offenders, this wave of stabbings is the symbol of a central dimension of insecurity: its link with immigration. This is not, of course, to essentialize badly: a large part of the violence in France has no connection with immigration and takes place in France, between French people."
23194	3	The political left as a movement has proven to be made up of some of the worst people imaginable – the kind of people who crave destruction and delight in oppressing others. They may think they revel in a form of anarchy, but they are actually quite the opposite: They are creators of chaos, but only as a means of gaining total control.
23194	5	"However, while leftists give me the creeps with their pungent smell of evil, there is one group of people that is even more annoying, and that is the ""people-who-don't-take-side"". and fake moderates."
23194	7	Although these people never admit it, sometimes a social conflict arises and one side is completely right while the other side is completely wrong. Fake moderates claim that the wrong side has merits, even if there are none, because they want to appear to be “wise”. The truth is that they don't have the guts to take a stand one way or the other, and so they act as if neither side is right, or both sides are partly right.
23194	9	In other words, the destruction side is allowed to continue their looting because, hey, we don't want to come across as being discriminatory or biased, do we?
23194	11	This is how societies and cultures are slowly but inevitably erased and the principles that are dear to them are reduced to nothing. This is done primarily through apathy and a quiet tolerance of corruption. Compromise is the hallmark of “democracy,” and it is also the root of tyranny. If people did not compromise on their principles and freedoms, tyranny could not exist. This is why the Founding Fathers of the United States opposed pure democracy and formed our nation as a constitutional republic with checks and balances. Democracy alone often requires acceptance of toxic and oppressive behaviors that we might otherwise stop, all in the name of appeasement of the “majority”.
23194	13	Discrimination, sometimes, can be a good thing. It is a biological imperative that contributes to tribalism and has allowed humanity to survive as a species for millennia. Without the ability to discriminate, all behaviors, however radioactive, would proliferate, and this is what we face today in Western societies.
23194	15	When tribes faced members who were narcissistic, psychopathic, or downright schizophrenic and delusional, these people were often shunned or ignored, and for good reason. When lunatics and sociopaths are allowed to fit into a culture, they are also allowed to inject a certain level of moral insanity into that culture. Insanity is usually an innate condition, but insane habits can also be learned, and if people think there are benefits and gains associated with acting insanely, some of them will. and the problem will get worse.
23194	17	The political left argues that all discriminatory tendencies are a form of bigotry. Yet they are among the most bigoted people on the planet when it comes to opposing ideals and beliefs. We can see this attitude in their own policies and in the people they seek to censor. They willingly embrace the total erasure of all ideas that contradict their beliefs, and they do so because they know, given enough time, that this type of censorship works.
23194	19	They are trying to overthrow the old tribal pattern – Nowadays anyone who is “sane” must be converted or cast out of society.
23194	21	"The examples are numerous. Anyone who points out the lack of science behind transgender ideology and gender fluid theory is immediately considered a “bigot” and should be kicked out. Anyone who questions extreme environmentalism and carbon control is a “climate denier” and must be hunted. Anyone who questions government-paid “medical experts” and their draconian obligations is “anti-science” and must be hunted. Anyone who claims that Critical Race Theory is highly inaccurate and misleading is a “racist” and should be kicked out. Anyone who thinks teachers shouldn't be allowed to sexualize children in schools and exploit them for their own psychological gratification is a ""homophobe"" who needs to be kicked out. And the list is still long."
23194	23	"I have even seen leftists in the media defending heinous acts such as pedophilia, because to be deeply opposed to a character trait of any human being is to commit the greatest sin of leftist religion – Who are you to challenge an individual's internal ""truth"" and set limits on their behavior? You have become intolerant, and therefore you are a heretic."
23194	25	"Don't get me wrong, this ""fairness"" philosophy may seem like random madness, but it serves a very specific agenda. If all behavior is to be tolerated, then all evil can become acceptable. The only evil action you can then commit is intolerance of evil. Do you see how it works?"
23194	27	"Psychopaths and those who lack empathy can now rule our culture because they cannot be confronted without great social risk. In a world where everyone is a good person deep down, the idea of ​​""fairness"" might work (probably not), but in a world where inherent evil exists and those people have no qualms about hurting whoever they want to get what they want, a culture built on fairness is doomed to self-destruction. All they have to do is pretend that they are part of an oppressed class, a group of victims, and therefore you have no right to question their actions."
23194	29	"If men want to pretend to be women and invade women's sports, women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's prisons and women's health, we must let them, because if we don't, we deny their ""existence"" as they see it in their own heads. If a pedophile wants to commit an act of pedophilia, we must let him do it, because if we do not, we are guilty of discrimination against a psychological minority. If a mother wants to kill her unborn baby out of convenience, we have to let her, because who are we to tell her that she has to face the consequences of her sexual acts? Leftists do not believe in moral boundaries, only political boundaries. The only behaviors that can be restricted are those that conflict with their ideology."
23194	31	The past few months have been rather surprising in terms of Supreme Court rulings and I can only hope this represents a step forward from our nation's extreme flirtations with leftism. The end result of the “do what thou wilt” philosophy is crystal clear – It can only lead to the complete collapse of society and the indoctrination of future generations. And maybe, just maybe, some members of the Supreme Court understood that.
23194	33	Rulings in favor of the constitutional right to self-defense finally ended the political left's obsession with disarming its opponents. They view the 2nd Amendment as the last bastion of a conservative culture that opposes their plans to absorb America, turning it into something unrecognizable in the process. As in all authoritarian regimes, leftists seek to take away the right to defend themselves from anyone who does not believe like them. Their dreams are crushed, for now.
23194	35	The decision to end Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections is perhaps the most surprising of all. Leftists see cultural tolerance of child murder as their greatest victory. It's not about women's bodies or women's rights; if abortion was about “human rights,” then they should honestly consider the rights of the child in the womb. But they won't, because rights are irrelevant to them. What abortion is really about is changing the boundaries of what Americans are morally willing to endure. What long-standing virtues are we willing to sacrifice, and how many children are we willing to sacrifice in the name of “tolerance and fairness”?
23195	3	The Speaker of the US House of Representatives is expected Monday in Singapore, the first leg of an Asian tour that could include a visit to Taiwan.
23195	5	The trip could further aggravate already strained relations between Beijing and Washington. After having long maintained the vagueness around her program in Asia, Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday leading “a congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific region to reaffirm America’s unwavering commitment to its allies and friends in the region”.
23195	7	“In Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, we will hold high-level meetings to discuss how we can promote our common values ​​and interests, including peace and security, economic growth and development. trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance,” she added, without mentioning Taiwan in her itinerary.
23195	9	Heightened tensions
23195	11	For weeks, tensions between the United States and China have been rising over reports that it may visit the self-governing island, which China considers part of its territory.
23195	13	Beijing would see a passage, even brief, of the speaker of the House of Representatives on the island as a provocation. Delegations of US officials travel to Taiwan frequently to express their support, but a visit by Nancy Pelosi, one of the state's most senior figures and one of the heavyweights in American political life, would be unprecedented since that of her predecessor. Newt Gingrich in 1997.
23195	15	“Strategic Ambiguity”
23195	17	"The United States practices a so-called ""strategic ambiguity"" diplomacy with regard to Taiwan, consisting in recognizing only one Chinese government, that of Beijing, while continuing to provide decisive support to Taipei but in refraining from saying whether or not they would militarily defend the island in the event of an invasion. It is this concept that has so far made it possible to maintain a certain stability in the region."
23195	19	Regarding Nancy Pelosi, the sequence is delicate: the Speaker of the House of Representatives is a central figure in President Joe Biden's Democratic majority, but her possible stopover in Taiwan would singularly complicate the task of American diplomacy, which is trying to avoid not sour relations with China.
23195	21	"Last week, during a rare direct exchange with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, US President Joe Biden assured that the United States' position on Taiwan had ""not changed"" and that his country ""s 'strongly opposed unilateral efforts to alter the status quo or threaten peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait'."
23195	23	"""Red line"""
23195	25	"For his part, Xi Jinping had called on Joe Biden not to ""play with fire"", and a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy had spoken of Nancy Pelosi's trip to the island as a ""red line"" ."
23195	27	Nancy Pelosi's visit comes as military tension mounts in the region.
23195	29	Taiwan's military conducted its largest annual military exercises this week, which included mock interceptions of Chinese attacks from the sea.
23195	31	Meanwhile, the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its flotilla left Singapore for the South China Sea as part of a scheduled operation, the US Navy said.
23195	33	And on Saturday, in response, China held a “live ammunition” military exercise in the Taiwan Strait.
23195	35	Washington has sought to downplay Nancy Pelosi's possible visit to Taiwan and called on Chinese leaders for calm.
23195	37	"""We have many differences when it comes to Taiwan, but over the past forty years we have managed those differences and done so in a way that has preserved peace and stability,"" the Secretary of State said on Friday. State Antony Blinken."
23195	39	In Taiwan, opinions are divided on the prospect of a visit by Nancy Pelosi, but figures from the ruling party and the opposition have said that the island must not give in to Chinese pressure.
23203	1	Poll: The French consider that racist remarks are acceptable from the age of 75
23203	2	A poll published on Wednesday revealed that an overwhelming majority of French people (96%) consider racist remarks to be acceptable when the individual is at least 75 years old.
23203	6	"“Before that age, it’s much more delicate. The French consider that the person does not have a sufficiently advanced age to justify their controversial opinions and generally judged as coming from another era, ”explains Stéphane Truchi, president of the executive board of the French Institute of Public Opinion. ""In contrast, a 75-year-old was born in 1946, so it's safe to assume that they grew up in such a different world that it causes an impact on the brain that's hard to control, which explains their racial slurs at unexpected moments of the Christmas dinner,"" he continues. “An educated adult in the 1970s could very well maintain a respectable status in society by making remarks about blacks and Arabs, even 'Mohammedans'. The French are well aware that they can't just stop loving their grandparents just because they have racial assumptions that make everyone uncomfortable. »"
23203	8	"""As someone who is turning 75 next week, I'm really happy to hear this and I can't wait to get my controversial vocabulary out for the holiday season,"" says Frédéric, a retiree who so far had to walk on tiptoe so as not to offend anyone."
23205	2	It is an unprecedented agreement that closed COP 26 today: the States have indeed committed to recycling all the promises of previous COPs.
23205	4	"“This is a huge victory for ecology. No new promise will pollute this COP placed under the sign of ""zero waste"""" declared the former Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma, at the end of COP 26. , after two weeks of arduous negotiations between the States. In addition to committing to recycle all the promises of other COPs, COP 26 has indeed promised to use the same sheets and the same ink, contenting itself with changing the dates appearing on the previous documents. It is also committed not to consume the promises too quickly and to ensure that they are sustainable and renewable. Thus, for at least ten years, the following COPs will not be able to develop new projects that are costly for the environment."
23205	6	An exemplary COP
23205	8	"With regard to greenhouse gas emissions and waste management, in particular plastic, the leaders preferred to kick in touch: ""We cannot treat everything at the same time, at the risk of being inefficient"" justified Emanuel Macron. Especially since the COP was exemplary from this point of view. “We also made sure to use the same language as usual and recycle much of our demagogic statements from previous years. welcomed Barbara Pompili, the Minister of Ecological Transition."
23208	3	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited American conservatives during a trip to Texas on Thursday to “join their forces” in the fight he intends to lead against “left progressives”.
23208	4	“We must coordinate the movement of our troops, because we face the same challenge”, launched the nationalist leader, invited to the high mass of the American conservatives in Dallas, where Donald Trump must also speak.
23208	6	“The progressives of today are trying to separate Western civilization from its Christian roots,” accused the leader (…)
23208	8	To thunderous applause, the 59-year-old leader insisted on the need to “take back control of the institutions” in Washington and Brussels, referring in particular to the upcoming US midterm elections in November.

23210	3	"The leader of the National Rally Marine Le Pen called for the abandonment of the sanctions against Russia, a statement described as ""extraordinarily dangerous, irresponsible"" by the Minister of Energy Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher on CNews this Wednesday, August 3."
23210	5	"Words that are, so to speak, not to the taste of Agnès Pannier-Runacher. Tuesday, August 2, the leader of the National Rally Marine Le Pen called for the abandonment of the sanctions imposed on Russia because of the war in Ukraine because, according to her, they ""are strictly useless"", except to ""make people suffer"". Europeans."
23210	7	"I hope that the sanctions ""disappear to prevent Europe from facing a blackout, in particular concerning gas imports"", declared the leader of the RN deputies during a press conference at the Assembly. national. ""These sanctions serve absolutely no purpose, if not to make the European peoples suffer and, incidentally, the French people,"" she said, adding that ""we are much more victims of these sanctions than we are. is Russia""."
23210	9	"The Minister of Energy Transition reacted this Wednesday on the antenna of CNews. ""The political personality who prides himself on being the most patriotic is in fact the first to be ready to sell our Republic for a dish of lentils to Russia"", lambasted Agnès Pannier-Runacher."
23210	11	We need to stick together
23210	13	I think this is an extraordinarily dangerous, irresponsible statement, and in any case, this European solidarity is our best collective bulwark. We saw this during the covid crisis with our ability to set up vaccine production lines and to vaccinate - we are the continent that has done this exercise the fastest of all the continents on the planet, continued the minister. .
2322	3	"Next Sunday, you will vote for peace or war. This is not a joke or a propaganda device. You look with dismay and sadness at the images of the war in Ukraine which bring us back to the horrors of the last century. However, when Ukraine was bombarding its own Russian-speaking populations in Dombass, the media told you little about it. If it was a conflict between distant China and Thailand, it would scare you less, but there the sound of cannons is much closer. If you do not want to hear it at home, measure the stakes, or more precisely the main and vital stake: peace or war. In Ukraine outside Dombass, until two months ago, people were living normally with their emotional and professional lives, their business and their hobbies, their daily worries and their projects. If you do not want the same situation that is theirs today, vote for peace, that is to say for the only one of the two candidates who wants to distance themselves from NATO. You don't really like Marine Le Pen? Me niether. Don't like ""extreme""? Me niether. All the more reason not to vote for the extreme center which, by its passivity, is leading us to disaster. It's been a long time since it's been a question of voting for the left or the right, whose behavior of the mentally ill man from the Elysée succeeded in summarizing and proving their little difference with his famous ""at the same time"", but to vote patriot or globalist. And there, in addition, it is a question of voting for peace or war."
2322	5	We have no chance of winning this war, our army has a lot of obsolete equipment that we have finished using unnecessarily in Mali, only has three days of ammunition in the event of a high intensity conflict. In addition, its small numbers are made up of 25% of people from elsewhere whose patriotism is subject to many doubts but treason to much less. No one has ever won against Russia, neither Napoleon nor Hitler, despite the enormous means that the latter had committed. It is observed that many of the localities where fighting is taking place today in Ukraine are the same as those where fierce clashes took place during the Second World War: Kharkov, Lvov, Taganrog and many others. But Russian patriotism has always won. This is proof that history repeats itself, contrary to what some journalists or occasional historians claim. So remember that France entered the war in 1914 and 1939 because of alliances that were poorly studied and respected late in life when prevention could have been enough to save the peace. We are there today with NATO.
2322	7	NATO (“the thing” as De Gaulle said) supposed to protect us against the USSR, should logically have been dissolved when the latter disappeared. But on the contrary, it has served to increase the hegemony of the USA, which is very skilful and has even made a routine of provoking wars, but especially not at home! With its expansion, NATO has become, by encirclement, a threat for Russia with which we should nevertheless maintain good relations, if only because it is our neighbor in Eastern Europe, also because of cultural Christian, like us. The USA pushed Ukraine into the conflict in the Dombass and now they would like to drag us all into this war where there will only be losers. If we don't walk away from NATO, war will come to us. The globalists want to believe that there will be war if we elect Marine Le Pen. If we elect Macron, we will still have this mental patient for five years and war in a few weeks. Like the other times, the Americans will provide arms to the countries in conflict, will bombard excessively and will land towards the end to draw the chestnuts from the fire. Then they will sell for gold a new Marshall Plan to rebuild as they did with fifteen European countries after the Second World War. During the latter, German Ford factories were supplied with engines from the USA via “neutral” countries. During the previous one, the French army also drove a Ford T, today it drives a Ford Ranger. See where the interests are...
2322	9	"As for the NATO wars, remember the most recent: Yugoslavia bombarded for three long months, including Belgrade for several weeks on the proven false pretext of the Muslim genocide by the Serbs. Result: a Muslim state in the middle of Europe, mafia and corrupt, stolen from Serbia, with the largest American base on the continent! Remember the war in Iraq, the so-called weapons of mass destruction held by this country and which have never been found... Remember the support for the Syrian jihadists who were doing a ""good job"" as Fabius said... you of the intervention in Libya which largely participated in the migratory invasion… Remember, don't have a short memory!"
2322	11	"Didn't like Muammar Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein? Look at the state of their countries today: instability, corruption, civil war, unemployment, misery and famine, just like Lebanon once ""Switzerland of the Middle East"". Don't like Vladimir Putin? Didn't you like how he got rid of the opportunists who were on their way to being richer than the Russian state and thus installing globalization in Russia? But do you find it normal that families can lend money to states, and that people talk to you about democracy when money is the ""sinews of war""? Let us quote for example Windsor, Morgan, Koch, Rothschild… As Napoleon said, “the hand which gives is above the hand which receives. Don't be naive and look at the history of France: Louis XIV neutralized his superintendent of finances Nicolas Fouquet because his fortune threatened to compete with that of the royal state. The business of the castle of Vaux-le-Vicomte was not only to overshadow the Sun King, he saw much further. Philip the Fair had eliminated the Templars because they were a larger financial (and military) force than the Kingdom of France. Whatever one thinks of all these historical or current figures, the principle is the same, we must not allow individuals or communities to be stronger than States. Otherwise, it is no longer the Common Good but individual or minority interests that prevail."
2322	13	"Today the project of a globalist and stateless society that is the “New World Order” developed in Davos is bankrupt, its excessive pretension has reached the same limits as the USSR. To find an alternative to this bankruptcy, the so-called covid pandemic was tried. But that wasn't enough. So we try to provoke a war intended to gather without murmur the living forces of the nations for a destructive confrontation. Many dictatorships have already used this method. Remember Videla dragging Argentina into the Falklands War to save his sinking regime. It is the same today, but on a planetary scale. Only lucid and patriotic peoples and nations will survive. Currently, the leaders of Western countries are increasing the ""sanctions"" against Russia with the main effect of destroying their own economies, and afterwards you will be told that it is ""Putin's fault"". You are told that the Russian people do not access information from the Western media, forgetting to remember that the opposite has existed with us since the beginning of the war. Everything is manipulation so that you are ready to accept the unacceptable while thinking of saving democracy, human rights and other beautiful living room ideas. The media glorify Ukrainian patriots, but for them a French patriot is a “far-right fascist”. And if you believe that “global warming” is caused by humans, tell yourself that if the war comes to us, that it becomes global, then it will really heat up!"
2327	3	"Mass vaccination of the human population turns vaccinated people into ""super-strain"" factories that produce deadly mutant strains of coronavirus that can devastate humanity."
2327	5	Leading vaccine expert (Dr Bossche) warns that mass vaccinations could create an “unstoppable monster” and that mass vaccinations during the pandemic could turn the relatively harmless coronavirus we first saw (SARS -cov-2) into a deadly “biological weapon”.
2327	7	The current vaccine, meanwhile, is not only on the verge of being completely obsolete as viral immunity is quickly achieved; it also permanently impairs the innate immune response to future coronavirus variants, leaving vaccinated individuals completely vulnerable and defenseless against exposure to mutant coronavirus variants.
2327	9	The net result is the very real possibility of a global mass death event that could potentially kill hundreds of millions and shatter global economies, governments and entire nations.
2328	3	Emmanuel Macron made these comments in Le Parisien in response to Mateusz Morawiecki's criticism of his telephone interviews with Vladimir Putin.
2328	5	The French ambassador to Poland was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Friday April 8 following remarks by Emmanuel Macron accusing the head of the Polish government of “extreme right-wing anti-Semitism”, Warsaw announced.
2328	7	"""Following the statements contained in the interview with the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron in Le Parisien, the Minister (Polish, editor's note) Zbigniew Rau has decided to summon the French ambassador"", indicated on Twitter, the spokesman of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In an interview with the daily Le Parisien on Thursday, the French president accused Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of being “a far-right anti-Semite, who prohibits LGBT people”, after having already accused him of “interfering in the French political campaign,” pointing to her closeness to her far-right presidential rival Marine Le Pen."
2328	9	“No one negotiated with Hitler”
2328	11	It was a reaction by Emmanuel Macron to the words of the head of the Polish nationalist-populist government who attacked him on Monday for these telephone interviews with Vladimir Putin. “Mr President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? We don't debate, we don't negotiate with criminals, criminals must be fought,” said Mateusz Morawiecki. “Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot”, asked the Polish Prime Minister, accusing certain European leaders of “procrastination” and “wooden language”.
2331	3	"“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is the cry of those brutally murdered on the streets of their hometowns. Warsaw is launching a poster campaign to ""raise awareness"" and warn about the ""war crimes"" and the ""genocide"" that Vladimir Putin is allegedly perpetrating in Ukraine."
2331	5	Poster campaign in Polish and European cities
2331	7	At the launch of this operation, on April 23, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the slogan “StopRussiaNow” would be displayed in many Polish cities – a campaign that has since spread to several European cities (including Berlin). It has also since turned out that this slogan “StopRussiaNow” exists in several forms, of which here are some variants:
2331	9	“The #StopRussiaNow campaign is launched. Posters thrown around Europe say: enough of dodging the question of aid to Ukraine. Enough of squirming and blocking real help. No rest for a tyrant and a murderer. We must stop Russia and break down the wall of European indifference. »
2331	11	"This initiative calls for a halt to imports of Russian oil into Europe, a boycott of companies working with Russia and also proposes making a bank transfer to a sub-account of the National Bank of Ukraine, stating that ""[this] donation will buy weapons and other equipment with which Ukraine will be able to defend itself against Russia! »"
2331	12	#StopRussianOil
2331	14	The issue of Russian oil features prominently in Operation #StopRussiaNow, which calls on European citizens to pressure their representatives to stop buying Russian crude and gas.
2331	16	“Every day, Russia sells oil and gas to the world for 700 million euros. […] With this money Vladimir Putin pays his bandits to rape daughters in front of their mothers and torture sons in front of their fathers. […] Do you want those responsible for this situation to go unpunished? »
2331	18	The site even provides a pre-written message in eight languages ​​to send to political representatives:
2331	20	“I am writing to ask you a very simple question. The Russians are murdering Ukrainian children, women and men. Why does our government oppose sanctions against Russia? Why didn't we put an embargo on Russian oil? Why do we keep pouring billions of euros into Putin? What did you do about it? »
2331	22	Child victims highlighted
2331	24	Taking up a sad constant of war propaganda, #StopRussiaNow posts the following message on its website: 208 children have been killed in Ukraine. 386 children injured by Russian war criminals. »
2338	3	While France under the dictatorial leadership of President Macron, who is the one and only to impose in Western Europe and recklessly mandatory vaccination on the French nation, aligning himself with the worst dictatorships, making the historical heritage of France by bringing shame on our origins without worrying about the consequences and nourishing the soil of a next civil war, making predictions of President Bashar El Assad, a coming reality. President Macron has provoked the French nation for the umpteenth time in an act of criminal madness unprecedented in the history of the world.
2338	5	First of all by lying again, going back on its promises and commitments, by imposing today a discriminatory vaccine passport to force vaccination. In fact, it makes all people who do not meet its criteria, pariahs of society who will not be able to do anything more, except stay cloistered at home. The Nazis did the same thing with the Jews during the Second World War by imposing a racial passport indicating the absence of filiation with the Jews, today the passport indicates if one is vaccinated and the other not, and the vaccinated becomes the new Jew in the assumed dictatorship of Macron, who has not finished destroying our nation through his criminal actions.
2338	7	The logical consequence of his scandalous decision is therefore the extension of the health pass, and this, from July 21, 2021 in places of leisure and culture. Unvaccinated children will no longer be able to participate in any activity, then it will be the turn of unvaccinated adults who will no longer be able to access cafes, restaurants, public transport and shopping centers at the beginning of August. Macron “adds that only those vaccinated and tested negative (without specifying the type of test by the way) will be able to access it. No more outside/inside differentiation, so we are once again forgetting the science that has proven to us that it is extremely rare to become contaminated outside.”
2338	9	The unvaccinated will therefore be driven out of society and social life, they will no longer have access to anything, their property will be confiscated, the state will steal everything from them. Macron had declared that we were at war, indeed, it is indeed the war against life that we are talking about here, because he is forcing a vaccination with vaccines which are not and which are still in use. conditional MA (marketing authorization) study and that taking such a decision is totally contrary to the precautionary principle, and perfectly illegal on the part of an individual who is a banker and who imposes a medical device on 66 million French people dangerous and unrelated to COVID-19 as a Pandemic.
2342	3	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It is about Germany and, in particular, about a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia, called Nord Stream 2. Washington considers this gas pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at all the way. Despite this, Nord Stream 2 went ahead and is now fully operational and ready to use. As soon as German regulators issue final certification, gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean, cheap energy, while Russia will see its gas revenues increase significantly. It's a win-win situation for both parties.
2342	5	The US foreign policy establishment is not happy with this development. They don't want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas, because trade creates trust and trust leads to expanded trade. As relations warm, trade barriers are lifted, regulations are relaxed, travel and tourism are increasing, and a new security architecture is being put in place.
2342	7	In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no longer a need for US military bases, expensive US-made weapons and missile systems, or NATO. . Nor is it necessary to enter into energy transactions in US dollars or store US Treasuries to balance the books. Transactions between trading partners can be conducted in their own currencies, which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream 2. It is not just a gas pipeline, but a window into the future, a future in which Europe and Asia come together in a massive free trade area that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the United States out. Warming relations between Germany and Russia herald the end of the “unipolar” world order that the United States has overseen for the past 75 years. A German-Russian alliance threatens to precipitate the decline of the superpower which is currently approaching the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream 2 and keep Germany in its orbit. It's a question of survival.
2342	9	"This is where Ukraine comes in. Ukraine is Washington's ""weapon of choice"" to torpedo Nord Stream 2 and drive a wedge between Germany and Russia. The strategy is taken from the first page of the United States Foreign Policy Handbook, under the heading: Divide and Conquer. Washington must give the impression that Russia poses a threat to European security. This is the goal. They must show that Putin is a bloodthirsty, unstable aggressor who cannot be trusted. To this end, the media has been instructed to repeat again and again that “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine”. What is not said is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that the United States has invaded or overthrown regimes in more than 50 countries during the same period and that the United States maintains more than 800 military bases worldwide. None of this is reported by the media, on the contrary, the focus is on the ""evil Putin"" who has gathered around 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, threatening to plunge all of Europe into a new bloody war."
2342	11	All of this hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of manufacturing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and ultimately divide Russia into small units. The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany. Watch this excerpt from an article by Michael Hudson on The Unz Review:
2342	13	“The only way left for American diplomats to block European purchases is to push Russia into a military response, and then pretend that revenge for that response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained during a State Department press briefing on January 27: “If Russia invades Ukraine, somehow another, Nord Stream 2 will not advance”1.
2342	15	It's written in black and white. The Biden team wants to “push Russia into a military response” in order to sabotage Nord Stream 2. This implies that there will be some sort of provocation intended to induce Putin to send his troops across the border to defend ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response will be swift and severe. The media will denounce this action as a threat to all of Europe, while world leaders will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler”. That's Washington's strategy in a nutshell, and all this staging is orchestrated for one purpose: to make it politically impossible for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to get Nord Stream 2 through the final approval process.
2342	17	"Given what we know of Washington's opposition to Nord Stream 2, readers may wonder why, earlier in the year, the Biden administration pressured Congress not to impose more sanctions to the project. The answer to this question is simple: Domestic politics. Germany is in the process of decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to fill its energy deficit. In addition, the threat of economic sanctions is a ""foil"" for the Germans who see it as a sign of foreign interference. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions? asks the average German. ""Washington should mind its own business and not meddle in ours."" This is precisely the answer one would expect from any reasonable person."
2342	19	Then there is this statement from Al Jazeera:
2342	21	“The majority of Germans support the project, it is only parts of the elite and the media who are against the pipeline…
2342	23	"""The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizing the project, the more popular it becomes in German society,"" said Stefan Meister, Russia and Eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. 2."
2342	25	Public opinion therefore strongly supports Nord Stream 2, which helps explain why Washington has opted for a new approach. With the sanctions not working, Uncle Sam moved on to Plan B: create an external threat large enough that Germany would be forced to block the opening of the pipeline. Frankly, this strategy smacks of desperation, but one must be impressed by Washington's perseverance. They may be down 5 points down the stretch, but they haven't thrown in the towel yet. They are going to give themselves one last chance and see if they can make any progress.
2342	27	"On Monday, President Biden held his first joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The hype that surrounded this event was simply unparalleled. Everything was orchestrated to manufacture an ""atmosphere of crisis"" which Biden used to pressure the Chancellor in the direction of United States policy. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said a ""Russian invasion was imminent."" His comments were followed by State Department spokesman Nick Price, who said intelligence agencies provided him with details of a Russian-backed false flag operation expected to take place soon in the United States. eastern Ukraine. Mr. Price's warning was heeded Sunday morning by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who said a Russian invasion could happen at any time, possibly ""even tomorrow."" This is just days after Bloomberg News published its sensational and totally false headline: “Russia invades Ukraine”."
2342	29	Can you see the diagram here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to pressure the German chancellor, who was unsuspecting and seemed unaware of the campaign targeting him?
2342	31	As one might expect, the deathblow was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference, Biden emphatically stated that:
2342	33	“If Russia invades […], there will be no more [de] Nord Stream 2. We will end it”.
2342	35	So, now Washington decides the policy of Germany???
2342	37	What unbearable arrogance!
2342	39	The German Chancellor was taken aback by Biden's comments, which were clearly not part of the original script. Despite this, Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream 2 and even refused to mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could bully the leader of the world's third-largest economy into cornering him in a public forum, he was wrong. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream 2, regardless of potential tensions in distant Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incentives Washington might prepare in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are willing to sacrifice to drive a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow the decline of the United States and prevent the emergence of a new “polycentric” world order? Anything can happen in the weeks to come. All.
2342	41	For now, Germany is in a strong position. It's up to Scholz to decide how the case will be settled. Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he give in to relentless pressure from Biden? Will he chart a new course that will strengthen new alliances in the bubbling Eurasian Corridor or will he support Washington's wild geopolitical ambitions? Will he accept Germany's central role in a new world order – in which many emerging power centers share global governance equally and where leaders remain unwaveringly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security? for all – or will he attempt to prop up the tattered post-war system that is clearly past its lifespan?
2344	3	A 19-page listing presents 198 responses from proponents of anthropogenic global warming (CAR), 198 responses to claims that would be made by climate skeptics. To my surprise, none of these answers mentions a measurement, an experiment, an observation that would present the increase in CO2 as “responsible for global warming”. We must believe, as we must believe JP van Ypersele who, in his book condemns CO2 without providing the slightest proof...
2344	5	"Colleagues of JP van Ypersele admit that their idea has only been ""proved"" for this fact: CO2 and temperature have recently risen simultaneously. This is not the first time and this ""proof"" has no value... any more than the ""proof"" of the 30 brilliant German physicists who, in 1930, proclaimed their opposition to general relativity. Einstein simply replied, “One physicist presenting an error would have sufficed. The consensus is not part of the inventory of evidence in science… Thus, the RCA remains without evidence today and is based solely on 2 assertions: 1) warming acts through infrared (IR) radiation and 2) more of CO2 heats the atmosphere by amplifying IR."
2344	7	In practice, since 1909 we know the experience of Professor Robert Wood: he observes that a greenhouse perfectly transparent to IR is at the same temperature as a greenhouse totally opaque to IR. If the greenhouses eliminated their heat by IR, the greenhouse transparent to IR would be less hot than the other… As the greenhouse can be as large as our atmosphere, it is clear that IR – contrary to what believers of the RCA – do not remove earth's heat primarily by radiation. Let us remember that the CO2 of the atmosphere has a role for the disciples of the RCA only by these IR. And as these IR do not intervene, the CO2 does not intervene either.
2344	9	Not long ago, I was looking to set up an experiment that directly implicates CO2 and demonstrates that radiation in the atmosphere – and CO2 in particular – does not influence Earth's temperature. This experiment, the physicists Seim and Olsen had already carried out in 2020! The return of radiation by the atmosphere to the ground – in particular its CO2, even concentrated 2,500 times – does not affect the temperature on the ground.
2344	11	CO2 exonerated, why do political “leaders” continue to plan an expenditure of 100,000 billion euros (IMF) to save the planet from an imaginary danger?
2344	13	"Let's be realistic: these ""managers"" are all incompetent in the field and their advisers avoid all contact with useful information, as the media avoids it with us. Influencers know where taxpayers' money should go. So, ask Mrs. Marghem, lawyer, former Minister of Belgian Energy, a question like “what is the kWh? » and have fun with his answer…"
2353	3	"Ukrainian refugees are beginning to flow into Poland and Romania, and some are already tensing up at this ""upsurge in immigration""."
2353	5	I am overwhelmed by the demagogic remarks of certain presidential candidates on this subject.
2353	7	I am therefore going to answer them bluntly: beyond the human tragedy represented by the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, this arrival of refugees would be highly beneficial for Europe, and in particular for France.
2353	9	Unfortunately, it would be a gift for Russia and a disaster for Ukraine at the same time.
2353	11	A demographic and historical reminder
2353	13	Let us recall the main demographic data of the countries concerned: in 2021, the European Union had 446 million inhabitants, without the population of Great Britain, following Brexit. Compare to 45 million Ukrainians and 146 million Russians.
2353	15	These three sets are in demographic decline, know it and care about it. Russia for geopolitical reasons, the other countries of the European Union, and in particular Germany or Italy, due to accelerated aging and an increasingly acute lack of manpower.
2353	17	Remember that there is already significant Ukrainian immigration to the European Union. According to the recruitment firm Manpower in an article in the newspaper Le Monde:
2353	19	It is considered that there are already 500,000 Ukrainians working in the Czech Republic, including those who are not declared, i.e. 10% of the working population.
2353	21	There are probably many more in Poland and Romania.
2353	23	It should also be remembered that Western Ukraine was for a long time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Poland, and is therefore culturally closer to Europe than to Russia. Which takes away weight from the Russian assertion, “Ukraine is at the heart of our history”, totally false for a large part of the country.
2353	25	This is reinforced by the fact that in 2018 part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church came under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople at the expense of that of Moscow, inheriting the branch that for centuries was attached to Rome.
2353	27	In 2019, more than 60% of Ukrainians declaring themselves Orthodox affirmed their membership of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
2353	29	This European tropism of Western Ukraine was, however, undermined by Stalinism, which expelled the Germans from this region, and especially the Poles, when the Nazis had already exterminated the Jewish population.
2353	31	If we add to this the communist persecutions aimed at Westernized elites, one would think that this western part of Ukraine has become de-Westernized.
2353	33	But this is only partial, as the electoral results and the linguistic distribution show: if the Ukrainians massively voted for independence in 1991, and in all the regions of the country, it is in the West that the vote in favor of the Yes was the most marked, while the Russian language is, conversely, more present in the East and in particular in the Donbass region, even if Russian speaking does not mean Russophile... President Zelensky is elsewhere Russian-speaking.
2353	35	The French situation
2353	37	The electoral campaign for the presidential election sees the question of immigration mixed with that of identity and security. The result is an overall rejection (in my opinion excessive) of immigration in general.
2353	39	Let’s be frank and direct: this rejection of immigration mainly targets Africans and Muslims, two categories that largely overlap. We forget that a large part of these Muslims precisely flee the religious constraints of their country, and that several million descendants of Muslims are no longer believers today.
2353	41	We also forget the advantage we have over other European countries of seeing immigrants arrive, many of whom speak and write French.
2353	43	This is a unique case in Europe: ask our neighbors across the Rhine if the Syrians and even the Italians or Kosovars they received so widely spoke German!
2353	45	Anyway, Ukrainians are Christians and nothing physically distinguishes them from other Europeans. However, they are not French-speaking.
2353	47	Conversely, these same French people are demanding jobs in their respective professions: in nursing homes, to take a current example, among teachers, judges or even the police.
2353	49	It should be remembered here that the French active population is only a little over 30 million people (including the 3 million unemployed, many of whom are not available), which is not much for approximately 68 million inhabitants. .
2353	51	Resorting to immigration to make up for this labor shortage is therefore entirely to our advantage and the lack of qualifications of some of the migrants does not necessarily constitute an obstacle if we think, for example, of the professions of helping people or nannies.
2353	53	Today, the sector of services to individuals and communities is in fact the leading sector that recruits in France with 38% of all hiring intentions.
2353	55	It remains to welcome them effectively and with dignity and to quickly authorize them to work which, in France, is often not the case.
2353	57	First contacts count a lot. However, with its slowness the French administration is particularly demotivating, which leads the populations concerned to undeclared work, trafficking and pilferage.
2353	59	Let’s not fall back into our mistake of 2004: when Poland entered the European Union, some countries, including Great Britain, immediately accepted Polish immigrants while France introduced a transitional period. As a result, they headed for Great Britain where they were very active. Brexit, which was partly directed against them, caused many to leave and their absence is now regretted.
2353	61	As for the Ukrainian situation today, France seems to want to play its part in welcoming refugees, as the President of the Republic affirmed at the EU summit in Brussels on February 25. .
2353	63	In 2021, more than 2,100 Ukrainians applied for asylum in France, a modest proportion of the 103,000 applications received by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Ofpra). But already, last year, some of these demands were based on the security situation in the Donbass.
2353	65	France already has 110,000 accommodation places available and 200,000 emergency accommodation places. In addition, the state could also requisition buildings or schools to house refugees if needed.
2353	67	The fact remains that, in my view, one of the solutions for welcoming these new migrants and enabling them to quickly access the job market would be to take the example of Germany and call on the voluntary sector, particularly religious, as well as to businesses.
2353	69	Even if I am not sure that these French actors have the same spirit of initiative and dedication as their German counterparts, we should try to motivate them with an information campaign and perhaps also with financial support.
2353	71	We can think of a decreasing subsidy granted to companies that would hire them immediately or even giving them access to apprenticeship status.
2356	3	If business leaders and financiers were serious, they would recognize the need for a dramatic change of course to ensure this planet remains hospitable to all humanity, now and in the future.
2356	5	Heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires are devastating communities around the world, and their severity will only grow.
2356	7	While climate change deniers remain powerful, the need for urgent action is now recognized far beyond activist circles.
2356	9	Governments, international organizations and even business and finance are bowing to the inevitable – or so it seems.
2356	11	In fact, the world has wasted decades tinkering with carbon trading and “green” financial labeling schemes, and the current vogue is simply to devise fancy hedging strategies (“carbon offsets ”) in defiance of the simple fact that humanity is sitting in the same boat.
2356	12	“Compensation” may serve individual asset holders, but it will do little to avert the climate catastrophe that awaits us all.
2356	13	The private sector's embrace of “green capitalism” appears to be a new trick to avoid a real settling of scores.
2356	15	If leaders in business and finance were serious, they would recognize the need for a radical change of course to ensure that this planet remains hospitable to all of humanity, now and in the future.
2356	17	This is not about replacing brown assets with green ones, but about sharing the losses that brown capitalism has imposed on millions of people and securing a future for even the most vulnerable.
2356	19	The notion of green capitalism implies that the costs of fighting climate change are too high for governments to bear alone, and that the private sector always has better answers.
2356	21	So, for proponents of green capitalism, the public-private partnership will ensure that the transition from brown capitalism to green capitalism will be cost-neutral. Investments in new technologies at a reasonable price will prevent humanity from falling into the abyss.
2356	22	But it sounds too good to be true, because it is.
2356	24	Capitalism's DNA makes it unfit to deal with the fallout from climate change, which is largely the product of capitalism itself. The whole capitalist system is based on the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses – not infamously, but with the blessing of the law.
2356	26	The law offers licenses to outsource the costs of plundering the planet to anyone smart enough to establish a trust or corporate entity before generating pollution.
2356	28	It encourages the discharge of accumulated environmental liabilities through restructuring in the event of bankruptcy. And it holds entire countries hostage to international rules that prioritize the protection of foreign investors' returns over the well-being of their own people.
2356	30	Several countries have already been sued by foreign companies under the Energy Charter Treaty for trying to cut their carbon dioxide emissions.
2356	32	Two-thirds of total emissions since the industrial revolution come from just 90 companies.
2356	34	Yet even if the leaders of the world's worst polluters were willing to pursue rapid decarbonization, their shareholders would resist.
2356	36	For decades, the gospel of maximizing shareholder value has reigned supreme, and executives know that if they stray from orthodoxy, they will be prosecuted for violating their fiduciary duties.
2356	38	No wonder big business and big finance are now advocating climate disclosure as a way out. The message is that it is the shareholders, not the managers, who must bring about the necessary behavioral change – the solutions must be found through the price mechanism, not science-based policies.
2356	40	The question of why investors, who have an easy exit option and plenty of hedging options, should care about disclosing future damage to certain companies in their portfolio remains unanswered.
2356	42	It is obvious that more radical changes are needed, such as carbon taxes, permanent moratoriums on the extraction of natural resources, etc. These policies are often dismissed as mechanisms that distort markets, yet they idealize markets that do not exist in the real world.
2356	44	After all, governments have been generously subsidizing fossil fuel industries for decades, spending $5.5 trillion (before and after taxes), or 6.8% of global GDP, in 2017. What if fossil fuel companies were to lacking profits to compensate for these tax breaks, they may simply sell themselves to a more profitable company, thus rewarding their shareholders for their loyalty.
2356	46	The script for these strategies has long been written in mergers and acquisitions law.
2356	48	But the mother of all subsidies is the age-old process of legal encoding of capital through property law, corporations, trusts and bankruptcy. It is the law, not markets or corporations, that protects the owners of capital goods even as they impose enormous liabilities on others.
2356	50	Advocates of green capitalism hope to continue this game. That is why they are now lobbying governments to subsidize asset substitution, so that as the price of brown assets declines, the price green assets increases to compensate asset owners.
2356	52	Again, this is capitalism. Whether this is the best strategy to guarantee the habitability of the planet is another question altogether.
2356	54	Instead of addressing these issues, governments and regulators have once again succumbed to the siren song of pro-market mechanisms.
2356	56	The new consensus focuses on financial disclosure, because this path promises change without having to realize it. (It also happens to generate jobs for entire industries of accountants, lawyers and business consultants, who themselves have powerful lobby groups).
2356	57	Not surprisingly, the result was a wave of greenwashing. The financial industry has blithely poured trillions of dollars into green labeled assets that turned out not to be green at all.
2356	59	According to a recent study, 71% of ESG themed funds (supposed to reflect environmental, social or governance criteria) are in contradiction with the objectives of the Paris climate agreement.
2356	61	We lack time for such experiences. If greening the economy was really the goal, the first step would be to remove all direct subsidies and tax aids to brown capitalism and force a halt to carbon “proliferation”.
2356	62	Governments should also enact a moratorium on protecting polluters, their owners and investors from liability for environmental damage.
2357	3	"Enjoy the introduction of Pierre from decoderleco who decoded the international statistics for us. And if you're still voting for our national banker, it's because you're misinformed, a victim of propaganda or vaccinated, bored, tired, and perhaps even more so, as a comment from a web user suggests, ""Injected people are still more fanatical, because the psychic protective bias must be extremely strong (because they know they have the product in them, to admit the product is dangerous is to drive the mind that has that thought crazy). »"
2357	5	He is right, and we have been coming back to this existential question since the beginning of the Covid era: how to get out of a sect.
2357	7	"The very relevant analyzes of Ariane Bilheran unfortunately do not give us the solution. We have fallen into a eugenic and hygienist totalitarianism and the involuntary collaborators or militants believe themselves indebted to the one who would have ""protected"" them by his vax and his pass."
2357	9	"To get out of it, only - perhaps - the repetition of the truth by articles, videos, conversations, on the inefficiency and the risks, the proven dangers of the passes and the pseudo vax ""and the observation more and more frequent of the post vax accidents in her relationships, will make the loophole allowing listening and taking seriously the side effects that screw up the lives of many women[2] [3] and of course all humans subjected to the many side effects, cardiac, neurological not to mention this immense unexplained fatigue that many injected feel."
2357	11	"We can also imagine that the biggest ""error"" of Eric Zemmour, but also of Pécresse and others, was not to talk about the impact of the covid crisis on the French, to underestimate it in the final choice of their ballot. It is necessary and even essential that Marine does not make the same mistake, especially since only 2% seems to separate her from her rival. So if she wants to hear us..."
2357	13	It should be noted that many of Z's potential voters finally decided to vote Marine because she made it clear in the last few days that she would permanently remove the vaccination pass and the compulsory vax and reinstate the suspended caregivers. Many testimonials prove it.
2357	15	"When people have taken the risk of injecting themselves with an experimental substance (with unknown risks), and moreover having their children injected, just to go on vacation or to a restaurant, it is because the concept of ""corruption"" does not is not reserved for the elites, nor for direct money, but for decades of ""Western"" living conditions that cannot be erased in a few months. Corrupted by the easy life and the apparent benevolence of the welfare state..."
2357	17	We must not underestimate the predominant share in the minds of voters of this covid and its pseudo current dangers, and its consequences on their choice of vote, which is further evidenced by the still too widespread wearing of the mask - not only useless but dangerous- at present.
2357	19	Almost everywhere the covid has disappeared and effective treatments have been proven in Algeria, India and equatorial Africa.
2357	21	But the media and lying doctors on TV sets have spread their venom. While waiting for them to pay, it is the naive ones who get bitten and vote for the enemy of the yellow vests.[4]
2357	23	The covidists are afraid of dying NOW, so the great replacement, and even the retirement age, the SMIG, the future of the children and of France, and even the purchasing power, it is no longer their problem. And yet they vote… It would have been necessary to speak their language to them, to think about it to find the words so well found for the rest.
2357	25	"The vax would not be forbidden to them and the other people are not dangerous, etc… We would continue to protect them… Some still are afraid of the wind during meetings in the street or at the office. You have to hear them, and talk to them. And don't sing ""talk to me about something else"", but rather how your friends and neighbors are doing and try to analyze with them the loss of periods in young girls or the heart attacks that have become really frequent among young athletes... Stress has good back..."
2358	1	For a racial approach to immigration
2358	3	Everywhere in the media are celebrated all these exotic tribes and their respective specificities.
2358	4	We are indignant that in China gigantic displacements of the Han population come to overwhelm these brave Muslim Uighurs, adorned with all the virtues.
2358	5	Concerning Africa, it is fashionable to fall in adoration in front of these multitudes of ethnic groups, each with its language, its customs, its religion. Everyone agrees that they must be respected and protected.
2358	6	As for the natives of Amazonia, they are simply deities.
2358	8	All these people are characterized by an approach to society that is ethnic (which can even be described as micro-ethnic for some, as they are fragmented), tribal and even clan-based for many of them.
2358	9	Anyone who would even dare to insinuate from near or far that many of these tribes are alike as two drops of water, would be immediately excommunicated by the left, accused of being racist and xenophobic.
2358	11	These ethno-tribal-clan social structures have existed for millennia and must be respected, promoted and sanctified. They embody Homo sapiens in all its original purity and, incidentally, allow university professors to have a job and students to do theses instead of pointing to Pôle Emploi.
2358	13	These people very rarely have an identity document. They don't need it, they recognize each other at a glance. With a simple look, an Utu knows whether he should cut a Tutsi with a machete or greet one of his brothers. Even in racially homogeneous countries like China, ethnic differences are obvious to everyone.
2358	15	The Africans and North Africans present on our territory categorize humans into four categories: Whites, Chinese, Arabs and Blacks. This distinction is obvious to them, and no one would have the absurd idea of ​​questioning it. Within their respective communities, Blacks and North Africans are just as naturally subdivided into nationalities, tribes and villages of origin. All this is perfectly normal in their eyes.
2358	17	In Europe, a few hours flight from France, there is a country artificially created by the UN, the United States and the EU, which is called Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many have forgotten it, but this golem was born on the corpse of the former Yugoslavia in 1992. Sick minds there wanted to play the sorcerer's apprentice by forcing three ethnic groups (Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims ) to share the same territory. A quick scan of the map shows the level of insanity of these two-penny demiurges.
2358	19	This pseudo-country is nothing more or less than a protectorate, with a kind of governor appointed by the UN, under the control of EUFOR, a European military force of around 14,000 soldiers.
2358	20	Thirty years after its creation, this monster is a failure. Secessionist currents are stronger than ever and interethnic antagonisms at their peak. The most fundamentalist versions of Islam thrive there, and the entire journalistic mafia continues to ignore the fact that terrorist training camps abound in the territory.
2358	22	The incredible Jean Quatremer, yet sold body and soul to Europe, declared on Arte that this project was doomed to failure because YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE TOGETHER.
2358	23	If Jean Quatremer, leftist, Europeanist and immigrationist is forced to admit it, he who once called rednecks all the French who had dared to vote against the Maastricht Treaty, we can take his word for it.
2358	25	Quatremer explains to us learnedly without flinching that it is all the same unthinkable to forcibly cohabit within the same country three white ethnic groups, who all speak more or less Serbo-Croatian and two of whom are Christians!
2358	26	All this is indisputable. It is necessary to take into account all the specificities and the various wishes of these populations.
2358	28	Uighurs, Bantus, Fulani, Australian Aborigines, Utus, Tutsis, Serbs, Croats, Kosovars, Berbers, we all recognize the right of them to affirm their ethnic and/or racial specificities, to assert them and even to be proud of them. .
2358	30	Well, what we celebrate for the peoples of the whole world, we deny to the French.
2360	3	In his interview with Le Parisien, Emmanuel Macron announced that he intended to “piss off” the non-vaccinated. At our microphone, he continued his reasoning: “To really piss off the unvaccinated, I decided to make the vaccination pass compulsory to access vaccination centers”. Thus, more than life, the President of the Republic will make vaccination impossible for the non-vaccinated.
2360	5	“And to make sure no irresponsible person approaches a vaccination center, I will place 2 MMA fighters at the entrance, each armed with a taser and a hungry dog. And not vaccinated the dog! Since they want natural medicine, they will treat rabies with rapeseed oil granules! said Emmanuel Macron before breaking into a laugh that shook the windows around us
2363	3	MOSCOW — In a televised address to the Russian people, Vladimir Putin announced that he had sent soldiers into the center of the Earth in order to “rid the earth’s inner core of Nazism. »
2363	5	“My parents fought against the German Nazis, and I will fight against hot spot volcanism,” the President of the Russian Federation said this afternoon before performing a judo hold on the globe. placed on his desk.
2363	7	"“This lava scum – what am I saying, this neo-Nazi lava scum – must be removed from geological power as soon as possible in order to facilitate the movement of our dear Eurasian tectonic plate”, continued the dictator who says he is eager to s to take over the planet's asthenosphere ""in order to liberate the iron, nickel and other minerals which are under the fascist yoke. »"
2363	9	According to the French intelligence services, the Russian soldiers have already started to penetrate the earth's crust, and they fear that if the lava does not surrender, the Russians will use drilling machines which vibrate so strongly that it tickles.
2363	11	"""The Russian president has always had a particular hatred for all kinds of geological strata, so I wouldn't be surprised if he went so far as to attack the central core of the Earth,"" explains Anne-Sophie Krafft, a French geologist."
2374	3	A major economic crisis, partly linked to the calamitous choices of the pandemic, is looming, bristling with inflation, energy rationing, uprisings and even international conflict. Covid, in all of this, weighs nothing.
2374	5	"The era is one of certified panic, of pythia labeled ""science"" and of risky predictions elevated to the rank of truth... Health, demography, climate, as Aider feared, man submitted to technology, as he said, yesteryear, to the Divine Creator. The future all mapped out, on the other hand, struggles to conform to the models... Our prodigies of leaders have rushed into the breach: basing their decisions on a scientifically validated future is a matter of providence."
2374	7	Unaware? Yes, without a doubt, but above all opportunists. They have their chicken guts 2.0, their deep learning coffee grounds. It remains to sort through the mass of forecasts in order to retain the one that serves their cause. Incidentally, everyone forgets or pretends to forget that error is part of the evolutionary process of science, but there is no question of stooping to the slightest skepticism, this skepticism which led Einstein to revolutionize physics: politics does not know subtlety.
2374	9	In the past, God ruled everything here below, but those times have passed: Nietzsche announced it to us 150 years ago, not doubting for a moment that new religions would replace their elders. Scientism killed Catholicism and we lost spirituality and eternal life in the process. Too bad… We still laugh at Dionysius the Little and the millennials, but are we really doing better?
2374	11	The Science God warned us in November 2020. We were heading towards 400,000 deaths. The president relayed the information and no one really flinched so we're doing it again, more discreetly: hear, hear, the epidemic will start again. You do not believe in it ? You doubt science. You are a pitiful obscurantist. A clarification: I practice in a covid center. I record the data on the dedicated professional sites on a daily basis. The disease exists and it has raged. It killed, mainly, within the population of very old and very tired men and, marginally, among the youngest, which distinguishes it from the seasonal flu.
2374	13	Mortality data ranks it among the pandemics of 1957 (Asian flu) and 1969 (Hong Kong flu). These would have claimed 4 million victims, but remember that then, for example among others, China and the USSR communicated in their own way... The counts have probably evolved over the past half-century. So, beware of comparisons, or even worse, as I read on a Mediapart article supposed to criticize the work of epidemiologist Laurent Toubiana, beware of comparisons of real data with estimates from simulations. Again and again them!
2374	15	Without sharing all of its moderate and widely argued positions, like my colleague, I think that the picture drawn up is not in harmony with reality. I remain convinced, considering the tensions and the very nature of the vaccine, that it should have been reserved for populations at risk. I remind you that certain prodigies (I include the President who has made us generations of refractories, with his claimed desire to annoy them) have dealt a severe blow to the vaccine cause, to which I am attached.
2374	17	At the origin of the health panic, the PCR, which generated a phenomenal financial mismanagement. Externality, through, according to our criteria of ignorant taxpayers, but does reckless spending only have an influence on the technocratic decision? State clerks brag all the more ostensibly as they gobble up billions in abysmal debts. They alone know how to make good use of what the paying pig gets in exchange for his sweat. Sweating is good enough for him.
2374	19	Acting reasonably exceeds his abilities, so the technocrat has the magnanimity to take charge of the expense side. In addition to these exciting wastes, the basic enarque was able, thanks to the PCR, to drool on the various platforms: he aligned the indexes and the neologisms, the incidence rates, the positivity rates and all this data with questionable values. Percentage forms the bulk of contemporary political discourse. Taxes, immigration, health, security, there is only that. The covid figures therefore made it possible to stun the béotiens and gently lead them to panic...
2374	21	At the start of the pandemic, everyone was destabilized and everything would have calmed down, but the rulers have, alas, taken charge of the situation. All the usual weapons in their arsenal were there, so how could you resist? They delimited the borders, designated the clans and they were able to divide, manipulate, push to the confrontation, distinguishing the friends from the enemies, the frightened braves from the ignoble obscurantists… Routine.
2374	23	The epidemic was going to destroy us, the services would be overwhelmed and the corpses would pile up unless… we submit to their injunctions. If one stooped to pay attention to these low-ceilinged obscurantists of conspiratorial antivax, it would be hell so some followed. What worked once should never happen again. We'll see: it's undeniable that people have been coughing and shivering in the cottages these past few days. Resuscitations, the only criterion I keep an eye on, are totally deserted (concerning covid, of course). There is a fifteen-day lag, so be patient.
2374	25	I find it hard to admit that in the absence of cases, of deaths, famous or not, of real patients, the population gives in to this panic which benefits all those who feed on the back of the beast, authorities, media, doctors on the plateaus, manufacturers of PCR, fans of work stoppages, financial aid from the State... Two camps are in confrontation: the bets are off.
2377	1	Emmanuel Macron will meet with global warming to ask him to immediately stop his aggression
2377	3	The president wishes once again to favor diplomacy to resolve the current crisis.
2377	5	The failure of negotiations to avoid conflict in Ukraine did not alter Emmanuel Macron's faith; it is indeed through dialogue that the Head of State hopes to resolve the new crisis that is hitting Europe” we will do everything to avoid an open war against global warming. We must avoid a decline that would directly affect the equity portfolio of the most fragile CAC 40 companies,” he said in a press release.
2377	7	The French president knows that he is walking on eggshells and that he will not be able to use too vindictive a tone during the negotiations “we must above all not humiliate global warming. Peace will not be built like that. “hammered the president to his European counterparts.
2379	3	"The volume of plastic will triple by 2060 in terms of use and waste. This is what the new report of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides on ""Global Plastics Outlook - Scenarios for Action to 2060"" published on Friday 3 June. Global use of plastics is expected to increase from 460 million tonnes (Mt) in 2019 to 1,231 Mt in 2060, while the volume of plastic waste produced is expected to jump from 353 (Mt) in 2019 to 1,014 Mt in 2060."
2379	5	Packaging is largely responsible for this. If they are not landfilled (which will concern 507 Mt of waste in 2060 if the trend is maintained), incinerated (for 179 Mt in 2060) or recycled (for 302 Mt in 2060), most of this waste ends up time in nature (for 153 Mt in 2060). As a result, annual plastic releases into the environment are expected to almost double, increasing from an average of 22 Mt in 2019 to 44 Mt in 2060. The stocks of plastics accumulated in the world's rivers and oceans are expected to increase by 140 Mt in 2019 to 493 Mt in 2060, a threefold increase.
2379	7	Whether for macroplastics (greater than 5 millimeters) or microplastics (less than 5 millimeters), the environmental consequences of this massive pollution are significant. Animals often become entangled in or ingest plastic debris, resulting in significant injury or even death, according to a 2018 WWF report. But human health is also increasingly affected: Decomposed plastic particles can end up in our organs and disrupt their functioning in the long term.
2385	1	“Geopolitics is changing”: expert Delyagin predicts a new scenario of the world order
2385	3	The balance of geopolitical forces is actively changing, as a result, political blocs are transforming their own roles and relationships with each other. If earlier EU member countries for the Russian Federation were the main “supplier” of innovation, today they have become a source of “real madness” — in an interview with the publication “Economy Today”, said Russian politician and economist Mikhail Delyagin.
2385	5	The gradual deterioration of relations between Russia and the countries of the European Union, caused by the reluctance of the latter to take decisions on their own, without the supervision of the United States, reached a critical point with the beginning of a special military operation, obliged to deploy the Kremlin on the territory which has become extremely dangerous, Ukraine.
2385	7	The large-scale punitive measures of economic restrictions against Russia included six voluminous sanctions packages, which had an extremely negative impact, first of all, on the economies of the member countries of the EU itself, rapidly moving towards recession.
2385	9	“Currently, there is an acute internal crisis in the countries of the European Union. The countries of the modern Western system have dug a hole for themselves, causing an energy and food crisis, causing massive influxes of migrants, the consequences of which are known”, – comments the expert.
2385	11	According to the expert, the social crisis caused by a major problem with migrants, will be another serious catalyst for the imminent collapse of Europe. Then the United States will follow, where an obvious election crisis, caused by the failure of Biden's policies and the rapid drop in his level of support, adds to a large number of problems.
2385	13	In the conditions when the countries of the Western system will desperately try to fight the above problems, Russia will be able to profitably use the chance to strengthen its own position of authority in the conditions of a new arrangement of geopolitical forces .
2385	15	“We are witnessing an absolute change in the development vector of the economy. The old economic system is obsolete — it was developed 3 centuries ago by financial speculators, in general, it is an area of ​​​​exchange of various types of goods. Basically, attention is paid to the tools of reproduction of material goods for each person personally - now everyone will be for himself, ”- believes Delyagin.
2385	17	Recall that a number of Western countries imposed large-scale anti-Russian economic restrictions which, contrary to the authors' expectations, proved unable to deal a significant blow to the Russian economy.
2386	1	Moldova risks losing its independence because of Western contests – ex-president Dodon
2386	3	The external course of the EU shows the exuberant rise of Russophobic sentiments and geopolitical hysteria. Today, a great challenge is issued by Europe and traditional values ​​— such a statement on the vast social networks published the former leader of Moldova Igor Dodon.
2386	5	"Ukraine's sensational European Union candidacy, according to the politician, was ""an inexpensive gift"" given to ""nezalezhnaya"" [independent Ukraine] for one purpose: to lure Kyiv deeply into insidious geopolitical productions under the shrewd leadership of Western European elites. And Ukraine in this scenario will be assigned the role itself unrepresentative."
2386	7	“In fact, we have become candidates for new political and military experiences, following the sad example of Ukraine. And the haste with which we took the candidates, as well as Ukraine, in the absence of reforms and a political regime of the ruling party, becoming dictatorial and rough violating the foundations of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms of citizens, confirmed that Moldova will play the role of a pawn on the geopolitical chessboard of the West”, – quotes RuBaltic.Ru.
2386	9	At the same time, Chisinau's thirst to become an active participant in the great Western game, will turn to the country with consequences of catastrophic magnitude, warns Dodon.
2386	11	“Due to the Russophobic policy carried out jointly with the West, we will not only lose profitable economic relations with our partners in the east, but also risk being left without part of our territories. As a result, Moldova as an independent state may disappear”, – underlined the former head of the country.
2386	13	Short-sighted and extremely dangerous, the current course of the Moldovan authorities is built on an aggressive and irresponsible basis, which in the near future will hit the innocent population of the country, — said the ex-president.
2386	15	“Statements by the country's leaders that EU candidate status obliges Moldova to adhere to anti-Russian sanctions are lies. For example, NATO member Turkey, which gained candidate status decades ago, has refused to back Western sanctions against Russia because they run counter to national interests. The war of the West with Russia is not our war”, – said the politician.
2386	17	The Moldovan authorities have forgotten the need for neutrality and the fundamental principles of sovereignty for a self-respecting state: the political course of Chisinau, according to Dodon, should be based solely on taking into account its own national interests, which are based on a mutually beneficial dialogue with the West and the East.
2386	19	Previously, Dodon had declared the extremely dire state of Moldova, noting that the country was barely poised on the brink of a global social, economic and energy crisis.
2386	21	Note, according to experts, today the Republic is desperately trying to “manage the two worlds”, finding itself at a very disadvantageous position, with great difficulty and fear of choosing another political course of action.
22104	1	Industrial action against Amazon: The invisibles from the second row
22104	3	Reports on working conditions at Amazon quickly become reports from a disaster area in this country: Poor exploited pickers, packers and parcels home deliverers tell - mostly pixelated - about apps that constantly monitor you, about fixed-term contracts, about bosses with the upper hand , from being at the mercy, from the desire to find another job.
22104	5	What gets lost in such scandal reporting are the ongoing struggles against the circumstances. At best, these become publicly visible when there is a strike again at one of the large Amazon logistics centers, in Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig or in Brieselang, for example. There have been frequent strikes, several times a year, for almost ten years.
22104	7	The fight for a collective agreement against constantly increasing pressure is impressive, the perseverance of the employees is unique. Even if there is still no collective agreement, the perseverance has paid off for the employees: Higher wages and better working conditions are concessions from the group.
22104	9	Almost no reports are made of protests
22104	11	But what about those who come after the large logistics centers in the work process, which are further down in the hierarchy? For those of the last mile who work in the smaller distribution centers or bring hundreds of packages to the front door every day? There is resistance there too. However, he is largely invisible. Again and again parcel deliverers tell of colleagues who do not put up with everything from the subcontractors they are employed by. Recover the withheld wages on their own.
22104	13	There is collective resistance when the deliverers of a subcontractor go on spontaneous strike and unload the parcels in front of the Amazon warehouse in protest to draw attention to the fact that the subcontractor is not solely responsible, but also the group, which is Subcontractor system benefits. Such protests are almost never reported on - also because hardly anyone notices anything about such actions. In Wunstorf, Lower Saxony, there will now even be a works council in one of the small distribution centers. There, the Verdi list won six of the nine places in the works council election, also because the Verdi union recognized that it is not just the employees in the large logistics centers that need to be organized.
22104	15	Perhaps there will soon be less disaster reporting and more reporting of how human exploitation is being challenged by humans.
22106	1	CO₂ compensation does not solve the problem
22106	2	Traveling sustainably and fairly does not mean having to do without air travel. But it requires dealing with politics. How ethical travel succeeds
22106	4	More and more people are questioning their own role as tourists and want to make their holidays more environmentally and socially compatible. But traveling ethically – how does that even work? Jon Andrea Florin from fairunterwegs explains why you should take a close look at hotel websites and what questions you should ask yourself before traveling to authoritarian countries.
22106	6	ZEIT ONLINE: The pandemic, the flood disaster, Fridays for Future - the events of the last few years have also made us aware of the ecological footprints that we leave behind with our holidays. Have they also made us better travelers?
22106	8	Jon Andrea Florin: We don't know that yet, we don't have the data yet. But what we do know is that more and more people are saying they want to travel more sustainably. There are many polls about this. For Germany, there is a travel analysis by the research association Holidays and Travel. Every year, it asks Germans whether they want to travel more sustainably. For environmentally friendly travel, the values ​​increased from 42 to 47 percent from 2019 to 2022 and for socially responsible travel from 51 to 64 percent. That's a big leap.
22106	10	ZEIT ONLINE: Is the age of ethical tourism coming?
22106	12	Florin: I'm skeptical about that. Because on holiday you also want to take a break from the superego, to put it psychoanalytically. People want to take a vacation from moral concepts and conscience, to leave behind all external and internal constraints. That's why I don't think the vast majority will pay attention to ethical components and instead will continue to travel as before.
22106	14	ZEIT ONLINE: Cities popular with tourists like Barcelona have almost as many visitors as before the pandemic. The residents, plagued by overtourism, certainly imagined things differently. Is it still reasonable to go to Barcelona, ​​Venice or Paris?
22106	16	Florin: Yes, that's still justifiable. But you should note a few things. Let's take Venice: one should not stay in the center and only travel in the low season, which in Venice is from November to February. If you then go on vacation with the locals and let local guides show you historical places that you don't get to see on a standard city tour, then locals get a good income.
22106	18	ZEIT ONLINE: They need that too. Because they have to pay higher rents because the many Airbnbs are driving up prices and making their living space scarce.
22106	20	Florin: Travelers could look for offers on Fairbnb, which is an association of landlords who also live in their apartments themselves and only rent them out when they don't need them. Airbnb is a good example of how a beautiful idea can be perverted. In Paris, 60,000 apartments were rented via Airbnb before Corona. As a result, rents have risen to such an extent that Parisians themselves can no longer live there. As an Airbnb user, however, you can see very well whether someone is offering two or three apartments or just one, which they will probably use themselves. Then I think you can stay overnight there.
22106	22	ZEIT ONLINE: What about trips to dictatorships and autocracies?
22106	24	Florin: If the tourists stay away, that can contribute to people becoming impoverished and then even more so hiding behind an autocratic leader. In the Philippines, for example, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a dictator's son, was elected whose father was notorious for corruption and human rights violations. Tourism has collapsed completely because of Corona and that has exacerbated the economic crisis in the Philippines.
22106	26	ZEIT ONLINE: Which countries are taboo?
22106	28	Florin: Certainly North Korea, but I would also avoid Myanmar with a heavy heart. Because in these countries it will not be possible to come into contact with the people. At least none that is not directed by the regime. And of course Russia at the moment, although I have mixed feelings about it. If you know your way around there and go to people you know, to whom you want to show that there is another point of view, if you have the feeling that you can get that across, then I would not advise against traveling to Russia per se.
22106	30	ZEIT ONLINE: Another factor is the consumption of resources in tourism. A room in a 5-star hotel in Goa, India, uses 1,785 liters of water every day.
22106	32	Florin: There is a simple formula that you can use as a guide: the higher the number of stars at the hotel, the higher the consumption of resources. You can check the hotel's website to see what sustainability initiatives it has. If there is nothing there, you can assume that the operators are not concerned. If there's a little side note about sustainability, they might only change towels when asked.
22106	34	ZEIT ONLINE: On your website you write that there are more than a hundred sustainability labels in tourism. How can I recognize serious labels and greenwashing?
22106	36	Florin: The easiest way is to build on certificates. There are now some booking platforms that offer certified travel and accommodation. Fairweg and Ecohotels are new; Forum Anders Reisen and We are Elsewhere have existed for a long time. You can also consult the label guide on our website or visit Tourism Watch. Together we make recommendations as to which certificates we regard as reputable. The sustainability labels are awarded by independent, external certification companies.
22106	38	ZEIT ONLINE: In view of the fact that we contribute to climate change with every flight: Isn't the claim to want to travel ethically just psychological greenwashing of oneself?
22106	40	"Florence: Good question! No, definitely not. Because we always leave an ecological footprint, no matter what we do. And if I decide to only fly once every five years, then that is definitely better than nothing. We have created five criteria to look out for when travelling. We call this the LUCKY formula: G for leisurely travel, i.e. on foot, by bike or by train. l prefer local offers. Ü How to be ready for surprises and don't tick off the ""101 must-see places"". Lower C like CO₂ by flying less or by compensating for flying. And K like paying correct prices."
22106	42	ZEIT ONLINE: You mean distance yourself from cheap offers?
22106	44	Florin: Working conditions in tourism are often very difficult. Not just for low-cost airlines. On cruise ships too, many people work under the most miserable conditions for ten, twelve, 14 hours at a time in housekeeping or in the kitchen. Others find themselves in dire straits, such as the travel guides in the Himalayas. Tourists can see where they can get the cheapest deal on booking platforms and then book there. This leads to suppliers lowering prices. This creates a price spiral downwards and the guides can no longer live from their work.
22106	46	ZEIT ONLINE: Compensation is controversial among environmentalists. Is it more of a cure for flight shame than an effective measure?
22107	3	Coal-fired power plants are to replace many gas-fired power plants in Germany. The Bundestag gave the go-ahead on Thursday evening and then the Bundesrat on Friday morning. Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) explained in the state chamber that it was a “climate policy step backwards” that more coal-fired power plants would be used to generate electricity instead of gas. However, this is necessary in order to reduce gas consumption.
22107	5	"The background to the decision is the gas crisis caused by the economic war against Moscow. Germany and other European countries have had to cope with lower gas supplies from Russia for several weeks. Repair work on a gas turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is to blame, which cannot be completed due to western sanctions. According to the federal government on Friday, however, ""positive signals"" have now been received from the Canadian government that the turbine serviced there will be delivered by Siemens Energy for Nord Stream 1. From Monday, the pipeline will then be closed for maintenance for ten days. After that, gas deliveries to Europe will be increased again, Moscow assures."
22107	7	"Nevertheless, the federal government wants to become independent of Russian energy sources as quickly as possible. In addition to liquefied natural gas from Qatar and the USA, coal power is now to be used more intensively. That, however, contradicts the promises the Greens made before they came to power. A few months ago, Kathrin Henneberger probably could not have imagined that she would now have to explain in the Bundestag why her party is deciding on the comeback of the climate killer coal power. In her speech, the Green MP tried to sell the »Replacement Power Plant Availability Act« as a »great success«. With a view to a Colombian open-cast mine, which has been criticized for environmental and human rights standards and which supplies Germany with hard coal, Henneberger said: It will be ensured that the decision does not further promote the coal industry in Colombia. This will be ""controlled by parliament"". In addition, they want to ""drive that we enter into energy transition partnerships with these countries and manage the change together: out of hard coal and towards renewables,"" says Henneberger."
22107	9	"Ralph Lenkert, energy and climate policy spokesman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, explained in his speech that the left-wing faction would approve the law because the traffic light had improved its draft. Many people today are afraid of the next energy bill, continues Lenkert. ""Without natural gas, there is a risk of cold apartments, food - including bread - could become scarce."" Gas, electricity and heat must remain affordable, jobs and income of employees must be secured, said the left-wing politician."
22107	11	"Oliver Powalla, energy and climate officer at the Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND), warned Junge Welt on Friday that the tense situation on the energy markets should not be a license to mobilize and use additional fossil fuels. ""The federal government must react prudently to impending supply bottlenecks and ensure that coal-fired power plants are no longer operated by means of mandatory energy savings,"" said Powalla."
22107	13	"Whether Habeck's coal plan will work is an open question. The power plant operator Leag, for example, currently sees ""insurmountable hurdles"" for its lignite-fired power plant in Jänschwalde in Brandenburg, as a group spokesman told dpa on Friday. This is about emissions standards. Since these requirements for the power plant blocks could not be met in the necessary time in the security reserve, the federal government had to make an exception for lignite. ""If we're supposed to be available in the fall, we won't be able to do it without a special permit."""

22107	21	- Letter to the editor from online subscriber Dieter R. from Nuremberg (July 9, 2022 at 07:40 a.m.) Yes, in view of the economic and political shambles that have been caused, the green warmongers are now panicking and throwing all environmental ambitions overboard. However, the trigger for the “comeback of the climate killers” is not the Ukraine war, as the headline incorrectly states. Rather, the looming catastrophic effects are due to previous aggressive decisions and actions by Western decision-makers such as NATO eastward expansion, prevention of Nord Stream 2, extreme armament, arms deliveries to Ukraine and, of course, the self-destructive, blind sanctions orgies. Whoever wages the unspoken »total war« against Russia at all levels and with all means alone bears the blame for the foreseeable consequences. The Ukraine war is not a trigger but a consequence of the western strategy of confrontation.Answers

22108	3	"The attempt by the United States and its allies to bring Russia to its knees with sanctions on oil, gas and coal exports is ""pushing inflation to levels not seen in decades"". The facts are obvious. The quote is from a statement from the G7 summit that took place in Bavaria early last week. It is obvious that the leading politicians in the USA, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan do not locate the cause of the misery in their own politics, but in »Putin's war«."
22108	5	"At the meeting of the G7, which was a G8 including Russia from 1998 to 2014, it was decided to look for ways to control and cap oil prices through the formation of a consumer cartel. This is intended to reduce Russia's revenues in order to ""increase and keep the economic and political costs for President Putin and his regime high,"" as Chancellor Olaf Scholz put it. That will ""require a lot of work,"" said Scholz. After all, it is not only a question of the industrialized countries of the West having to agree – which they have not yet done – but also of persuading the big buyers of Russian oil, such as China and India, to follow this policy. To achieve this, the most favorable mix of threats and promises, punishments and rewards is discussed."
22108	7	In the previous discussions, technical means of coercion are in the foreground. Tanker transport requires, among other things, ship insurance and credit. The financial centers of the West still play a role in this. One idea is to tie both to the fact that a certain purchase price of the transported oil may not be exceeded. However, this requires precise knowledge of the contracts and thus also extensive willingness to cooperate on the part of Russia's customers.
22108	9	"If that were easy, the G7 wouldn't still have to talk about this four and a half months after the start of the war in Ukraine. Washington's Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said in early June that the US government was in ""extremely active"" discussions with European countries to find more ways to limit Russian oil revenues."
22108	11	With the same goals, the US and EU are also aiming to force the price of Russian natural gas down. So far, however, only the consequences for the economy and for the social situation of the majority of the population in the west have been negative and there are fears of catastrophic effects in winter.
22108	13	"Klaus Ernst from the Left Party, who chairs the Bundestag Committee on Climate Protection and Energy, therefore proposed in an interview with the Rheinische Post on Wednesday that the ""completely failed"" sanctions policy should be corrected and that the Nord Stream gas pipeline should be temporarily commissioned with Russia 2 to speak. He was then violently attacked by the party co-chairs Janine Wissler and Martin Schirdewan and by the co-group leader Dietmar Bartsch. But while the capitalists are at least discussing the advantages and disadvantages of possible measures intensively in their media, Ernst's opponents only refer dogmatically to their interpretation of the party congress resolution, instead of presenting factual arguments."
22108	15	The price of a barrel of Brent was just under US$112 at midday on Thursday. After briefly peaking at $139 in March, it has averaged between $100 and $115 for several weeks. That is still extraordinarily high: For the first half of the year, this results in an average price of 103.76 US dollars, compared to 70.68 in the previous year and 41.96 in the first corona year of 2020. To find an average price like the current one, you have to going back in 2013. The background is clear: there is no free capacity anywhere. These are very bad conditions for a customer cartel.

22110	1	part of state policy
22110	3	"The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, recently got caught up in a scandal over the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian version of fascism. Polish Defense Ministry head Mariusz Blaszczak last Wednesday called the ambassador, now recalled from Kyiv, a ""useful Kremlin idiot"" after the diplomat described Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera as ""Robin Hood"" and ""the personification of the freedom struggle."""
22110	5	"The German-Polish historian Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe had already reminded DW in May that »Bandera naturally wanted a Ukrainian state, but he wanted a fascist state, an authoritarian state, one in which he was the leader would have been"". However, Melnyk seems to get away with it this time too. At best, he'll get a promotion in Ukraine's foreign ministry, because after all, when one criticizes Ukrainian neo-Nazis and radical nationalists, there is little ideological basis for countering pro-Soviet sentiments."
22110	7	However, both Ukrainian politicians and Western allies often prefer to show off, since in this case it is difficult to conduct a consistent information policy. For if on the one hand there is a rehabilitation of fascism in Ukraine, then the formal justification for the Russian invasion is at least not without importance. On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians and officials themselves are giving away such trump cards, glorifying the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists with its military wing (OUN/UPA) and Bandera. This is not even a fringe phenomenon but has become part of state policy. Bandera's supporters parade through the capital Kyiv in a torchlight procession every year on his birthday. In 2016, the capital renamed Moskovsky Prospekt to Bandera Prospekt. On the positions of the Ukrainian troops, in addition to the national flags, the black and red UPA flags can be seen everywhere.
22110	9	However, the problem with rehabilitating fascism in its Ukrainian version is that you have to be hypocritical all the time. Even students and housewives are encouraged to be hypocrites, glossing over Bandera for liberal Western audiences but glorifying his deals for right-wing and nationalist audiences. You just have to identify the interlocutor first. Skillful use of such duplicity is said to help save the lives of the husbands and children of Ukrainian students and housewives drafted into the army.
22110	11	The logic here is this: condemnation of the OUN/UPA's crimes may lead to an uprising by neo-Nazis and nationalist paramilitaries amid hostilities - an undisguised glorification of reducing financial support from Western liberal society. Another manipulative instrument used to rehabilitate fascism is the reference to the »fight for the nation«. In Ukrainian national ideology, the concept of »Ukrainian« as a representative of an ethnic group has been replaced by the concept of »Ukrainian« as a supporter of radical nationalism since 2014. From this perspective, the fight against fascism becomes a fight against all Ukrainians as against one people.
22110	13	But western liberal politicians swallow that too and often refer to the figure of the president. However, Volodymyr Zelensky is a nominal and ephemeral figure, while the rehabilitation of Ukrainian fascism is a long-term policy more justified by external geopolitical interests. From the pragmatic point of view of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis, Zelensky only serves to disavow some of the thesis of Russian propaganda, which in turn contributes to the flow of money and arms to Ukraine for their long-term goals.
22110	15	And the fact that Russia is using the anti-fascist rhetoric of denazification for its own pragmatic purposes cannot justify defending or rehabilitating Ukrainian fascism and radical nationalism.

22116	1	The never-ending farce of US sanctions on Russia
22116	3	by Joseph Solis-Mullen - http://www.antikrieg.com
22116	5	"Rather than seek a diplomatic solution to the civil war in Ukraine that it helped start (by supporting the unconstitutional transfer of power in that country in 2014), the Biden administration did so in the months leading up to the Russian invasion eager for the imposition of ""extreme"" economic sanctions in February."
22116	7	The threat of such additional sanctions, as Washington had already imposed a number of sanctions in 2014, was supposedly intended to deter the invasion. When that failed, it was claimed that the sanctions would force Russia to the negotiating table.
22116	9	That too has clearly failed.
22116	11	Given the centrality of economic warfare to Washington's foreign policy, it is worth examining how the Kremlin has managed to keep Russia's economy afloat since invading Ukraine, what the wider ramifications may be, and how it might applied towards China in the future.
22116	13	First, the immediate collapse of the ruble was halted by the actions of the Central Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance. While the former doubled interest rates almost overnight, the latter began spending its accumulated reserves to offset price inflation, which was beginning to eat away at the purchasing power of Russian consumers. Although Washington and its vassal allies have withheld almost half of their foreign exchange reserves, the Moscow government has used its record balance of payments surplus to offset the temporary loss.
22116	15	This balance of payments surplus, the result of continued oil and gas sales at lower volumes but higher prices while imports fell sharply, has mitigated the impact of domestic inflation, which currently stands at around 17 percent, but did not prevent it economic growth in Russia fell drastically (a decline of around 10 percent is now expected for the coming year).
22116	17	As governments from Washington to London, Warsaw and Vilnius have made it clear that they do not support lifting sanctions even in the event of a cessation of hostilities, Russia's future growth is likely to lag far behind what it would otherwise have been. With Russia lacking access to Western capital and technology, it will become increasingly dependent on China, India or other developing economies for imports, but also for finding customers for its energy exports, as a much of Europe wants to drastically reduce or eliminate its dependency on Russian hydrocarbons.
22116	19	In the long term, therefore, there is little doubt that the current sanctions will weaken and impoverish Russia. Of course, just like now, the Russian people will bear the cost of the West's financial war - not its leadership.
22116	21	As usual, we are supposed to believe that the people of countries hit by US economic warfare will blame their own governments, not Washington - that they might even depose Vladimir Putin and welcome the West! Aside from the fact that this has never worked, from Cuba to Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, etc., Anne Williamson declared twenty years ago that if one consider that the last time Russia invited the west, the likes of Jeffrey Sachs, Larry Summers and Paul Rubin destroyed the economy and handed it over to oligarchs who they ultimately hoped would hand it over to western multinationals.
22116	23	Of course, the Russian people are not alone in their current impoverishment. Ordinary people around the world are also becoming poorer and weaker because of Washington's policies. As Europeans drain their savings in the face of record-high gas, oil and food prices, many in the developing world will literally starve long before the war in Ukraine is over - which, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, may be years away.
22116	25	That this policy has been hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike is not surprising: America's Democrats are delusional with hatred of Russia because they cannot accept Hillary Clinton's failure to defeat Donald Trump, while Republicans like Ted Cruz are committed to mercantilist interests are, d. H. US oil and natural gas producers looking to sell to Europe. In the first case, while Russia deliberately tried to interfere, it did not exert any demonstrable influence on the elections, which even the well-established Economist admits; in the second case, US gas and oil exports are already climbing to an all-time high.
22116	27	Demonstrating its ability to force others to comply with its policies and make its own people suffer the consequences, Washington has undoubtedly succeeded in getting the message it intended to send to Beijing about Taiwan. While Washington's arming of the global financial system has no doubt alarmed Chinese Communist Party planners, the fact that its own people would be willing to suffer for the reunification of their country and the fact that many countries in the developing world have avoided following the West's lead, there is ample reason to doubt the effectiveness of the looming sanctions as a deterrent in the event of another, major crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
22116	29	That doesn't stop Atlantic Council officials from dreaming about it ahead of a NATO summit focused on saber-rattling Beijing-bound.
22116	31	After all, what does a history of failure and mass impoverishment prove if not that next time will be different?
22116	33	If only Karl Marx had been right when he said, following Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Rather, the truth seems to be that if Washington continues to pursue proven failed and immoral policies, we are doomed to suffer a never-ending parade of farces.

22130	1	"The world's biggest sponsors of their own imperial power are demanding the ""decolonization"" of Russia"
22130	3	"Most recently on June 23, a US Congress-funded organization — the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission — hosted a virtual conference calling for the ""decolonization of Russia."" This raises the question of why decolonization of the United States has not long since been sought. After all, this nation was literally founded by successors of white colonists who first had to cross an ocean and then violently wrest this territory from the native people."
22130	5	"While the speakers at the conference, which can be heard here, took the current crisis in Ukraine as a starting point, they called on the Russian Federation to ""decolonize"" regions and republics that - like Siberia and Tatarstan - had been inhabited since the 16th century or – such as Chechnya – have been governed from Moscow since the early 19th century."
22130	7	"Such a demand would be tantamount to asking the US to give up all of its territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific, not to mention more recent annexations, such as Hawaii, which only became a full-fledged US state in 1959. When a conference attendee asked how the US should deal with the issue of Hawaii in the face of this ""decolonization of Russia"" debate, the panelists babbled around the question and soon changed the subject, ultimately just to prove that really didn't want to be that concerned with ""decolonization"" but is actually more interested in breaking the Russian Federation up into pieces."
22130	9	"Speakers at the conference focused heavily on ""Russia"" in the Soviet era, although the rest of the Soviet republics they mentioned were already part of Tsarist Russia long before the 1917 revolution. If anything, the USSR gave all these territories more independence than they ever had. Conjuring up the specter of the Soviet Union and confusing it with modern-day Russia is the standard ruse used to incite hysteria against Moscow as some sort of imperial power ostensibly trying to conquer the world."
22130	11	But such an attempt is doomed to fail from the start. Of course, as noted historians such as Eric Hobsbawm and Jean Bricmont have pointed out, the irony is that, apart from the Soviet Union, no other nation in the world has actively supported a Third World liberation struggle against colonialism. And certainly after the Second World War it was the USA that mercilessly campaigned for the preservation of western colonialism.
22130	13	"So if you look at cases like Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Palestine or Nicaragua, just to name a few examples, it was the USSR that supported each of these countries' national independence struggles, while the USA defended the ""old regimes"" militarily. The most notable case, of course, was South Africa and the South African frontline states, where the US and Israel were desperately trying to maintain apartheid and settler colonial rule, while the Soviet Union and its ally Cuba were fighting – and quite successfully so – to defeat those rulers ."
22130	15	Furthermore, it must be emphasized that it was the Soviet Union, more than any other nation, that led the fight against Nazi Germany's attempt to colonize Europe - and ultimately the rest of the world - in the 1940s. The USSR sacrificed 27 million people.
22130	17	"Meanwhile, since World War II, the United States has built an empire of unprecedented proportions. It is estimated that the United States operates approximately 800 formal military bases in 80 countries, a number that could exceed 1,000 when counting troops stationed at embassies, missions and so-called ""dormant"" bases and the approximately 138,000 abroad stationed soldiers. No other nation in the world has ever had, or today has, such a military reach. In fact, the relatively few other countries that have military bases abroad collectively have less than a tenth the number of US bases."
22130	19	In fact, only eleven other nations operate bases abroad, which together make up about 70. Russia has an estimated 26 to 40 bases in nine countries, mostly in former Soviet republics as well as Syria and Vietnam. Speaking of Syria, while speakers at the Helsinki Commission tried to claim that Russia is engaged in some sort of neo-colonial endeavor there, in reality it is the US that is appearing as an uninvited – and therefore illegal – invader in Syria, taking a third of the country against the the will of the Syrian government and regularly looting Syrian oil for themselves in this occupied country, in violation of the Geneva Conventions.
22130	21	Meanwhile, Washington continues to maintain its colonial hold on territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, Guantanamo Bay and Hawaii, not to mention that the entire area of ​​what is now the United States of America and Mexico is lands stolen from indigenous peoples.
22130	23	"In short, the US government and its compliant NGOs have no moral basis for ""decolonizing"" anyone before they have set about decolonizing their own territories."
22130	25	Such an effort could begin with the removal of US military bases around the world and the concomitant withdrawal of all US foreign troops, as well as the return of all stolen assets and resources to countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Russia, the return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, holding referendums in Puerto Rico and Hawaii on their independence, and paying wider reparations to Native Americans and the descendants of former slaves.
22130	27	"A focus on the sins of one's own country would not only be right, but also more promising and also avoids the risks associated with advocating the forced disintegration of other nations such as the Russian Federation - as the Helsinki Commission did in its loud appeal, which was at least implicit calls for a ""decolonization of Russia""."
22130	29	"Daniel Kovalik teaches International Human Rights at the University of Pittsburgh and is the author of the recent book 'No More War: How the West Violates International Law by Use ""Humanitarian"" Intervention to Advance Economic and Strategic Interests'."

22130	37	RT DE strives for a broad range of opinions. Guest posts and opinion pieces do not have to reflect the editor's point of view.
22137	1	Neither Russia nor the USA want a free Germany
22137	3	Many patriots in Germany, at least the majority who call themselves patriots, believe that the Russians are the good guys. This is not about the Ukraine conflict, but about the fact that the German people still think that the Russian army has retreated and left German soil. The propaganda for this has of course been successful since Central Germany was renamed East Germany, but the fact is that the real East or East Prussia is still Russian-occupied territory.
22137	5	The difference between the American occupation is only one, that the Germans were expelled and thus it is not visible to anyone at least in everyday life. So if, like many patriots, Russians are friends, why don't they give East Prussia back? Over 20,000 Russian soldiers are stationed in East Prussia. There are also over 60,000 American soldiers stationed in Germany. Neither the Americans nor the Russians want a free Germany, they always put their own interests first and these are not to make Germany strong again. But to keep it on the ground for their interests, because a free Germany would mean a free Europe and this should not happen.
22138	1	SPD MEP speaks out against bans on Russian media
22138	3	"In a guest article in the Frankfurter Rundschau, which appeared on Wednesday last week, SPD MEP Petra Kammerevert pleaded against EU bans on Russian media and for the protection of diversity of opinion and media. The EU would lose credibility if it used autocratic methods ""against Putin""."
22138	5	The current cause is the EU's new package of sanctions against Russia, which is currently being discussed. Among other measures, it includes the ban of three Russian television channels, the state-owned RTR Planeta and Rossija 24, as well as the Moscow regional channel TV Center. So far, these exclusively Russian-language channels have been received via cable, satellite and the Internet, at least in Germany.
22138	7	Kammerevert already doubts the EU's legal competence for the ban: The Commission bases its decision-making power on the contractually standardized competence to regulate economic relationships, but argues with the influence of the broadcasters on the formation of social opinion. This is contradictory in itself and reveals that the true motives for the ban are not of an economic nature.
22138	9	"However, the deputy also argues more fundamentally: You can only ""morally win"" against Putin if you do not sacrifice ""our freedoms for the purpose of supposedly protecting our society"". With the ban on Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, this is exactly what has already been done, writes Kammerevert. One cannot blame Putin for the ban on Deutsche Welle and do the same with Russian broadcasters."
22138	11	Whether the ban actually works is doubtful. With the help of VPNs, the RT live stream can still be accessed. Kammerevert further:
22138	13	The textual distribution of propaganda is still possible undisturbed, because texts are not subject to a license.
22138	15	"Kammerevert appealed to refrain from bans and to trust ""our diverse and independent media"" to ""unmask propaganda and disinformation"". Legal violations should be punished by the media regulators of the member states. She finds it worrying that it is left to ""big platforms"" to ""define fake news and disinformation with their terms and conditions"". Even beyond the individual case, the politician expresses concern about legislative initiatives that are aimed at ever further restrictions on freedom of opinion and freedom of the media:"
22138	17	Overall, freedom of the media in Europe is gradually being severely restricted and the old saying 'the opposite of good is well-intentioned' applies. What we need instead of further restrictions are effective instruments to defend media freedom and diversity.
22138	19	Among the German MEPs, the SPD MEPs were the only ones who had voted against the bans on RT and Sputnik by a majority in the European Parliament. While the deputies from the ranks of the CDU/CSU, the Alliance Greens and the FDP voted for the bans, the parliamentarians of the left and the AfD abstained in the vote in the European Parliament at the time.
22138	21	"More on the topic - ""Not fans of RT, but ..."" - Dutch journalists want to challenge RT ban in court"
22138	23	"By blocking RT, the EU aims to silence a critical, non-pro-Western source of information. And not only with regard to the Ukraine war. Access to our website has been made more difficult, several social media have blocked our accounts.

2214	1	Fear of civil war as a result of mass immigration.
2214	3	Former French intelligence chief Pierre Brochand warns that unless Europe and France radically change their policies on mass immigration, civil war could break out: “All multicultural societies are doomed.”
2214	5	Brochand, who was director of France's DGSE from 2002 to 2008, spoke in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.
2214	7	"""All 'multicultural' societies are doomed to more or less deep divisions,"" Brochand warned, adding: ""In such a situation, it happens that minorities are violent winners and majorities are peaceful losers."""
2214	9	"The negative effects of mass immigration on France can no longer be dismissed, because ""it is becoming increasingly difficult to prevent the French from seeing what they see"" and also because ""suddenly a pioneering figure in the formulaic world of politics that encouraged them to open their eyes,"" Brochand said."
2214	11	If Emmanuel Macron wins the presidential election and does not massively change his stance on immigration, a civil war could ensue, the ex-intelligence chief predicts.
2214	13	"""While this gradual upheaval of the French population is not the only challenge we face, it is the only one that directly threatens civil peace on our territory,"" Brochand said, warning that Muslim and non-European migrants are experiencing a ""spirit of... postcolonial revenge”."
2214	15	"He also warned that the significantly higher birth rate among migrants and the fact that younger generations of immigrants are ""even less integrated into French society than their parents"" are threatening the very fabric of French society."
2214	17	"The only solution, according to Brochand, is the ""remigration"" proposed by French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour. H. Incentives and obligations for millions of migrants to return to their home countries."
2214	19	"When asked if it was too late, Brochand replied, ""In any case, it's very late. Let's not kid ourselves: we are no longer dealing with scattered individuals, i.e. with many 'special cases' who are all looking for a better future, but with diasporas."""
2214	21	"“A diaspora is an entity made up of immigrants and their descendants, most notably French, who come together and whose numbers reach a critical mass sufficient to encourage, through social pressure, the maintenance of the beliefs and ways of life of the countries of origin, with whom relations remain strained,” explains Brochand. ""In this way, more or less closed foreign enclaves are formed spontaneously, turning their backs on the host country and its customs."""
2214	23	Brochand's conclusion is sobering and grim.
2214	25	All of my experiences lead me to foresee a dark, very dark future for our children and grandchildren. At best, they're heading for an unexpected collapse in their quality of life (an implosion), at worst, we're leading them into horrific confrontations (an explosion). Most likely there will be a combination of both amid growing confusion.
2214	27	As reported by RemixNews(link is external), Brochand made his comments amid another wave of migrant unrest sweeping through major French cities.
2214	29	As of last week, the cities of Sevran and Aulnay-sous-Bois in the Paris suburbs have been the scene of a veritable urban guerrilla war, and similar scenes have taken place in Villeurbanne and Vénissieux in the Lyon suburbs. Each time, incidents between police officers trying to enforce the law and violent, multiple-recidivist criminals have sparked riots, shootings, and several fires, ambushing the police squads called in to reinforce them.
2214	31	"A poll published by Harris last year found that a majority of French people are concerned that ""European, white and Christian populations are at risk of extinction"" as a result of ""Muslim immigration""."
22142	3	No petrol, no gas, power outages, horrendous prices: for months people in Sri Lanka have been taking to the streets because of the severe economic crisis. The country's president and prime minister have now announced their resignations. The US Secretary of State blames Russia for the crisis.
22142	5	"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed on Sunday that ""Russian aggression"" in Ukraine was partly to blame for the unrest in Sri Lanka. The island state has been shaken by a wave of protests for several months. Food and medicine shortages, fuel and gas shortages, and skyrocketing prices have pushed people onto the streets."
22142	7	The unrest escalated on Saturday as thousands of protesters stormed the president's residence, forcing him to flee. The Prime Minister's private residence was also stormed and eventually set on fire. Head of State Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced their resignations over the weekend. The island state south of India, with a population of around 22 million, is experiencing the worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1948. US Secretary of State Blinken told reporters in Bangkok:
22142	9	We see that the effects of Russian aggression are being felt everywhere. She may have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka; we are concerned about the impact around the world.
22142	11	"He claimed that the world's ""growing food insecurity"" was ""significantly exacerbated by Russian aggression against Ukraine"". Blinken again urged Moscow to let 20 million tons of grain out of Ukrainian ports, which it says are being blocked by Russian forces as part of their military offensive in the eastern European country."
22142	13	"The US Secretary of State added that in Thailand, too, fertilizer prices have ""skyrocketed"" due to the alleged blockade."
22142	15	Russia, meanwhile, denies all allegations of blocking food exports. Moscow says it offers safe passage for cargo ships, but Ukraine prevents civilian ships from leaving ports, including Odessa. The sea mines laid by Kyiv are a threat to shipping in the area.
22142	17	"Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said some countries were trying to exploit the food safety issue ""in the worst possible way"", accusing Moscow of ""something it is not involved in"" and ""whitewashing"" Ukraine ""."
22142	19	Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history in May. Fuel rationing was introduced earlier in the month and armed police and soldiers were deployed at petrol stations. The crisis is being attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has deprived the island nation of important tourism revenues. Increased government spending, tax cuts and quantitative easing pushed up inflation.
22142	21	Around 100,000 people are said to have surrounded the Sri Lankan President's residence in the capital Colombo on Saturday. The politician had previously been brought to safety.
22143	3	Finally, the US-led military alliance called NATO has made clear its ambitions for a global cold war. At last, the warmongering organization has emerged from the treacherous hideout where it has been hiding for years. And therefore, from now on, may she be condemned by all sane people in the world.
22143	5	"At a summit in Madrid this week, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization released a new strategic concept calling Russia a ""direct threat"" and China a ""challenge"" to ""our values ​​and interests."" What exactly are these values ​​and interests? Warmongering and supremacy!"
22143	7	"The last time NATO released a strategic document was in 2010. At that time, Russia was referred to as a ""partner"" and China was not even mentioned."
22143	9	Over the past decade, the US-dominated military bloc has adopted increasingly hostile policies toward Russia and China. The search for a new Cold War was relentless, unyielding, and largely implicit. But now the US-led axis is openly declaring its hostility.
22143	11	The 30-member NATO has formally invited two new European countries, Finland and Sweden, to join its ranks. The two Nordic countries are thus ending their decades of nominal neutrality, which can only be seen as a calculated provocation to Russia's national security. The new members will double NATO's land border with Russia and reinforce the nuclear-armed alliance's already growing presence in the Arctic. Moscow has warned against such NATO expansion as a wanton destabilization of the strategic balance. The fact that the bloc is pursuing expansion shows a reckless disregard for efforts to ensure mutual security and the preservation of international peace.
22143	13	"This week's NATO summit has also made it clear that the US-led military axis is at loggerheads with China. Why else would an Atlantic organization invite, for the first time, four Pacific states that have increasingly aligned themselves with American anti-China rhetoric? The leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea were in Madrid to form the so-called ""Asia-Pacific Four"" (AP4). Like the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the AUKUS Pact, the Pacific is becoming a NATO battle zone against China, much like the Atlantic is dominated by NATO hostility to Russia. Ultimately, it is the United States and its imperial interests that are being served and providing direction. This is what is really meant by the vague and apparently benevolent invocation of ""our values ​​and interests""."
22143	15	"This escalation in 2022 is consistent with NATO's historic role. It was established in Washington in 1949 as an offensive tool for US aggression against the Soviet Union. American imperialism's zero-sum ideology is inevitably based on hegemony and domination. Other nations are either vassals or enemies. A multipolar world of mutual partnership is an anathema. In fact, the very concept of the United Nations is dreadful. The world must be divided into ""allies and enemies"" for US militaristic capitalism to survive."
22143	17	When the former Cold War with the Soviet Union ended in 1991 with the political and economic collapse of the Soviet Union, the initial euphoria about the supposed American victory quickly evaporated. Author and commentator John Rachel examines how the dizzying talk of an end to militarism and excessive military spending and the expectation of a massive, transformative “peace dividend” have been all too cruelly brushed aside. And why? Because the American rulers and their NATO vassals realized that without militarism and war, the game for their capitalist profiteering was over.
22143	19	Thus was born the Wolfowitz Doctrine and “full-spectrum dominance” with which the United States and its European vassals literally declared war on the planet to constrain natural resources and keep perceived competitors in check. A resurgent Russia and an emerging China would not be tolerated as obstacles to American hegemony.
22143	21	The past 30 years since the end of Cold War I have seen nothing short of an orgy of US-NATO warmongering, with weaker nation after weaker nation being destroyed by American-led militarism. International law and human rights have been eroded and plundered by a Washington-led blitzkrieg on the planet.
22143	23	Principled people like Julian Assange who exposed such crimes have been persecuted and tortured. Free speech and genuine independent critical thinking have been harassed and murdered.
22143	25	With incredible hypocrisy, arrogance and infatuation, US President Joe Biden and other NATO accomplices exalt the principles of democracy, rules-based order and international law. In truth, the United States and its NATO minions are the enemies of world peace. Martin Luther King made a similar statement almost 60 years ago. He was then assassinated by the US National Security State. Washington and its Western or Pacific accomplices are the greatest threat to whatever they supposedly and cynically uphold.
22143	27	The United States and its imperialist henchmen in NATO have been striving for a new Cold War for the past three decades. When the Russian Federation, led by President Vladimir Putin, challenged the unilateralism of the rogue state USA and its satraps with his landmark 2007 Munich speech, he was declared an enemy. Russia's military intervention in 2015 in support of Syria, which was being attacked by the US and NATO in a covert war for regime change, ended the orgy of American-led imperialist gangsterism. This spoilsport made Russia an enemy to contend with.
22143	29	"The 2014 Washington-NATO coup in Ukraine was another landmark event. It was a virtual extension of NATO to the borders of Russia with a Nazi spearhead. Could it be any more provocative? But Moscow drew the red line. Despite repeated calls for a diplomatic solution to Ukraine and NATO enlargement, Russia has been forced to take ""technical military measures"" to neutralize the threat posed by the Kiev regime."
22143	31	China, too, has boldly demonstrated that it is not willing to subordinate its independence to Washington's imperial rule. That's why Washington is abandoning its half-century-old one-China policy of its own accord, with the ulterior motive of angering Beijing. The provocation against Russia in the form of a NATO-armed Ukraine is the same coin as the provocation against China with a US-armed Taiwan and increasing NATO encirclement in the Asia-Pacific region.
22143	33	It is no exaggeration to say that this week's NATO summit was tantamount to a war planning conference. The US-led axis has created a new global cold war.
22143	35	That in itself is damnable. In a world beset by pandemics, disease, environmental degradation, poverty, hunger and unemployment, the capitalist powers are pouring billions into the war machine and fomenting a confrontational fever based on fear mongering, phobia and demonization. Their mentality is demonic. US-led imperialism has caused much of the world's current crises, including a new Cold War.
22143	37	Yet the world has changed dramatically since NATO was founded 73 years ago, or even since the end of the last Cold War some three decades ago. There is indeed a terrible danger of a catastrophic hot war. However, there is also a welcome danger that NATO will dig its own grave through its criminal activities and unfortunate contradictions. If Russia and China stand their ground, it could be enough to push the US axis into the grave it deserves.
22144	1	No more masochism exercises: Open up Nord Stream II!
22144	3	"The prevailing infantile policy under the direction of a small farmer and author of children's books is about to serve. It follows a government bard suspected of fascism, brings ""children's thoughts to power"", but ruins us instead of the targeted Mr. P. in Moscow. How naïve one can be, as a political Halma player, to want to hit the Russian chess grandmaster with tailor-made blockades that leave out exactly what we need and block exactly what his country needs - and also to assume that in the long run you will be in charge keeps and the other side parried at the word?"
22144	5	Politicians want to lay out the opponent according to the rules of the art in order to then hit him properly
22144	7	"Such political silliness has never existed at the state level in the history surveyed by the author. In this respect, the saying about the ""turn of the era"" hits the facts. As expected, the US-affiliated traffic light policy fails at the first half-broken gas turbine, which the Canadians - there you go! – should be released repaired so that they can be brought to Russia in an exceptional procedure. Of course, the transport is only released once for one's own turbine, all other sanctioned transports to and from Russia remain blocked. Greetings to Lithuania and the Russian corridor to Koenigsberg!"
22144	9	"Is Oskar Lafontaine right with his statement: ""Scholz is Putin's and also Biden's idiot""?"
22144	11	"The former SPD chairman and Federal Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine (here and here) could express what the majority in Germany thinks and, for example, hundreds of readers in the forum of a ""Welt"" article (here) almost unanimously confirm: This policy must go. It has frightened and harmed us enough already and bodes ill for the future."
22144	13	"Instead, all pressure must be exerted in the direction of stopping weapons and war in Ukraine and recognizing that the deeply hostile ethnic groups can hardly be peacefully united in one state. Especially not when everything is shot up with ever heavier weapons. At the same time, the supply of energy from Russia, including Nord Stream II, is to be restored – with the anti-Russian blockades being lifted. Fatal slogans like ""Never again energy from Russia"" and ""We will ruin Russia"" should seamlessly continue where they already belong - as Mr. Blinken's press spokeswoman, who ""comes from international law"" and has therefore internalized the right of the strongest."
22158	1	Study: Federal pressure on Paxlovid could accelerate COVID mutations
22158	3	Biden's FDA bypasses doctors to prescribe ineffective drugs
22158	5	The Pfizer drug used in the four-time vaccinated Dr. Anthony Fauci causing a relapse of symptoms when he contracted COVID-19 could help accelerate mutations in SARS-CoV-2 after FDA expands emergency use approval, according to a preprint study.
22158	7	Virology researchers at Innsbruck Medical University found little difference in the number of hospitalizations or deaths between placebo and Paxlovid recipients in an analysis of the Pfizer study, Just the News reported.
22158	9	"Marty Makary, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said the study clearly shows that overuse of Paxlovid in low-risk people can induce resistance and create new viral mutations, calling it a ""risky proposition""."
22158	11	Still, the FDA has authorized state-licensed pharmacists to bypass doctors by prescribing the drug directly.
22158	13	"The cardiologist Dr. Anish Koka of Philadelphia wrote in his newsletter this week that seven months after the drug's approval, ""it seems someone in government has decided that not enough Paxlovid is being prescribed."""
22158	15	"The doctor said he's been ""struggling with quite a few requests for Paxlovid lately"", mostly from ""young vaccinated patients"". Patients felt pressured to take the treatment and ""just wanted reassurance from a professional that it's okay not to take a drug."""
22158	17	"Koka said he received a ""panic call"" from an emergency room when a vaccinated and high-strung elderly patient developed a fever and chills after a round of Paxlovid he prescribed."
22158	19	"The doctor now regrets exposing his patient to ""the side effects of a drug with little to no benefit,"" while ""doing nothing"" seems to work better ""in the vast majority of cases."""
22158	21	Vice President Kamala Harris took the drug for her asymptomatic COVID infection this spring. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month he experienced a relapse of COVID symptoms after being treated with the drug.
22158	23	In May, the Centers for Disease Control issued a formal warning that treatment with Paxlovid could lead to a recurrence of COVID-19.
22158	25	Just the News asked the FDA how the expanded EUA might affect mutations, especially if the people most interested in taking the drug are already vaccinated and boosted.
22158	27	"FDA press secretary Chanapa Tantibanchachai referenced a memo from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Review arguing that the expansion allows for ""timely treatment"" for eligible patients since the drug is now ""abundantly"" available stands."
22158	29	"But the study shows that the emergence of resistance was ""inevitable,"" according to respiratory disease specialist Peter Wark of Australia's University of Newcastle and the Hunter Medical Research Institute."
22158	31	"University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad tweeted that Pfizer ""is going to make more than $20 billion from this drug and they still haven't come up with a positive randomized trial in vaccinated people."""
22158	33	"""Healthy 20-year-olds with no comorbidities and three shots are taking this product,"" he said."
22158	35	Prasad sees political motivation behind the push for Paxlovid.
22158	37	"""The concern, of course, is that it must be viewed as an offer for political rather than medical reasons,"" he wrote. “You have to limit the cases right at the time of the midterm elections."
22158	39	"""The other concern is that Pfizer obviously has an oversupply of products, and this move will help them sell that supply. Are they only working in Pfizer's best interest?”"
22168	1	Everything is collapsing in Germany - but the elites celebrate their festivals
22168	3	The elites party like there's no tomorrow. The most expensive and second largest parliament in the world says goodbye to the summer holidays and an eight-week break while everything in the country crashes. But Germany's political crème gave themselves to Lindner's decadent marriage on Sylt, where until recently, thanks to the same politicians mobilized with a 9-euro ticket, asocials and punks had been hanging around, and then the champagne edge. Some even floated in in a climate-appropriate private jet.
22168	5	All of this is happening while in the “last Germany of all times” the first collapses and crumbling are beginning to appear from cracks that have been visible for a long time. There is a shortage of specialists in all areas and increasingly also unqualified unskilled workers - because those who could work no longer want to or earn more money abroad, while Germany is becoming a paradise for all those who do not work. And with constantly rising energy prices, which are borne by the state, unlike in private households for recipients of basic security, Hartz IV status is increasingly becoming an insider tip and a luxury; not just for the refugees pouring in unchecked from all over the world.
22168	7	Parcel floor, counter clerks, cashiers, airport handlers, security people are missing. 100,000 truck drivers alone are needed. There is a shortage of teachers, police officers and accountants - although the state creates 120,000 new permanent positions for people with full pensions every year. Also to nurses, mainly thanks to a ludicrous institution-related vaccination requirement. Inflation is through the roof due to the irresistible and highly dangerous combination of money bloat and shortage of goods. In real terms, it should reach 12-15 percent this winter, and the trend is rising. Today we are economically closer to Sri Lanka than to the old Federal Republic.
22168	9	But the elites and their constituents don't get it. You don't hear the shot, not the gunfire, not the whole barrage. Empty supermarket shelves. Shut off gas supplies, looming blackouts. Fuel prices, which will tend to rise steeply again. Supply chains and missing spare parts. Our roads are dilapidated, almost all bridges are in need of renovation. The craft collapses. Public safety is eroding, swimming pools are becoming terror camps. There is no proper schooling. Families fall apart, clans triumph. And on top of that migration, family reunification, “repopulation” without control and without end.
22168	11	And they celebrate their summer festivals – before they make our lives even more difficult in winter with new corona harassment. Apparently this is all on purpose. (DM)
2217	1	Fridays for Future: Save Palestine for the climate!
2217	3	The image conveyed by the media of “Fridays for Future” as harmless Friday hoppers and truants does not correspond to reality. One could suspect that for a long time, but now it is becoming more and more apparent.
2217	5	Jumping and truancy for the climate: the harmless children next door – that is the media image of “Fridays for Future” (FFF). Clever observers had suspected for some time that this movement might not be quite so harmless in reality and that it might be pursuing an ideological agenda that goes far beyond “something with climate”.
2217	7	"Postcolonialism, ""anti-racism"" and other aberrations - these parts of FFF have become increasingly obvious in recent years, most recently with the discussion about the racist content of felt locks. Firmly part of the repertoire of the Friday Kids - at least their umbrella organization - is a die-hard hostility to Israel, as FFF has now demonstrated once again on its Twitter channel."
2217	9	"""Climate justice means justice for Palestine, solidarity with Palestinian organizers in Germany and around the world,"" it read in English on Friday. The background to this is the ban on assemblies that the Berlin police issued for pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the weekend on the occasion of the so-called Nakba Day (day of the founding of the State of Israel, which the Palestinians celebrate as a ""catastrophe"")."
2217	10	"These bans amounted to an ""act of repression"" that ""we"" - i.e. Fridays for Future - ""are appalled"". In another contribution, she made it unmistakably clear that the organization is not just concerned with protecting freedom of assembly in Germany, but that it is explicitly aiming at Israel."
2217	12	Israel problem known
2217	14	"In it, she referred to the death of Palestinian reporter Shirin Abu-Akle on the sidelines of an Israeli anti-terrorist operation on Wednesday. The cause of the death - whether it was Palestinian gunmen or an Israeli ricochet - is still under investigation, but that doesn't stop FFF from claiming that ""Abu-Akle was murdered (!) by the Israeli military""."
2217	16	"An Israel problem at FFF had already revealed itself several times in the past. In 2021, for example, the international umbrella organization had agitated against Israeli “settler colonialism and imperialism” and distributed Palestinian propaganda cards. The German offshoot and Luisa Neubauer had distanced themselves at the time and spoke of ""anti-Semitic content""."
2217	18	"Of course, the Neubauer troupe didn't want to give up the ""Fridays for Future"" label. Apart from that, it remains questionable whether FFF Germany even has its own people under control when it comes to positioning on Israel and anti-Semitism. For example, on Sunday Fridays for Future Mainz shared a call for a “demonstration on the anniversary of the Nakba”."
22172	3	Regensburg (dpo) - All clear for the global climate! Thorsten Kohnmüller from Regensburg has just remembered that it was sometimes very warm in the summer when he was young, and thus impressively refuted the research of thousands of climate researchers worldwide.
22172	5	"All this hysteria about global warming is completely ridiculous! When I was 13, it was already 36 degrees in summer, Kohnmüller explained on Wednesday, dismantling the central thesis of global climate research that had been proven for decades. ""Everyone had no heat that day and I was in the outdoor pool until the evening hours. I remember that very well. And what does Greta Thunberg say now??"""
22172	7	"He believes that the six hottest years since weather records began in descending order were 2020, 2016, 2019, 2015, 2017 and 2018. ""No, I'm quite sure that it must have been 1978. Or 1979. Anyway, I was really sweating then."""
22172	9	"In fact, it was so hot back then that he almost burned the soles of his feet on the asphalt in the parking lot in front of the lake, says Kohnmüller. ""The fine ladies and gentlemen climate researchers should explain to me how that could be. Climate change? No way! Chess and mate."""
22172	11	Kohnmüller's groundbreaking insight is a blessing for politics and business: Complex environmental protection measures can be discontinued worldwide, climate conferences no longer have to take place, and petrol will soon only cost 50 cents per liter.
2218	3	"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen became pathetic at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We are mobilizing all our economic power,"" she declared(link is external), ""Ukraine must win this war."""
2218	5	"Another ten billion euros in financial aid are to go to the country, which von der Leyen wants to ""help hand in hand"" to ""rise from the ashes"". She also considered stealing Russian assets: ""We should turn every stone for this - if possible also Russian assets that we have frozen."""
2218	7	They accuse Russia of using grain and energy as weapons; As an example of countries that would suffer from this, she cited Lebanon of all places, where the price of bread had risen by 70 percent. In this context, she did not mention that Lebanon is also the target of Western sanctions.
2218	9	"The EU Commission President also sees no contradiction to the plans to increase the proportion of ""green"" energy sources to 45 percent by 2030, thereby further reducing the need for Russian fossil fuels. The war in Ukraine is forcing the EU to accelerate the transformation of the European economy."
2218	11	After both the chemical and automotive industries had already declared that they could not produce under the conditions created by the sanctions, according to the Handelsblatt, the plans announced by the Commission were not well received by SMEs either. Its associations sent a letter to von der Leyen and demanded an end to the additional workload and more time for the necessary adjustments. In her opinion, the supply chain law and the introduction of a CO₂ border adjustment mechanism and various requirements for stricter obligations to provide evidence should be postponed.
22183	3	Nonetheless, no one should be mistaken in assuming that this development implies a transatlantic rift between the EU and the US, as nothing of the sort is afoot. Rather, the EU unexpectedly resisted the US after the latter had provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc by using Lithuania for this purpose.
22183	5	The European Commission's clarification that its anti-Russian sanctions should not be interpreted by Lithuania as a green light for a blockade of the Kaliningrad region strongly suggests that the bloc is concerned with the destabilizing influence that the US is said to have over the Baltic country. feels uncomfortable. Vilnius' unilateral interpretation of these earlier restrictions as a pretext for cutting off road and rail links with this Russian exclave was more of a Washington-orchestrated political provocation aimed at manipulating the minds of Westerners than an attempt to lower the living standards of the people in this region to deteriorate, as the author explained here at the time. The decision to join Brussels in this regard is therefore an unexpected defeat for this declining unipolar hegemon.
22183	7	The US successfully restored its hegemony over the EU under an anti-Russian pretense at the start of Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, even tricking its European vassals into counterproductively sanctioning its main supplier of raw materials, thereby triggering a totally avoidable economic crisis that tipped the euro to to par with the dollar for the first time in two decades. If some European companies were to go bankrupt anytime soon, their US and UK competitors would benefit. All in all, the US currently has almost total control of the EU, but they finally went too far when they got Lithuania to blockade Kaliningrad, provoking a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc.
22183	9	"That was too much for the ""Big Three"" (France, Germany and Italy), who quickly intervened through the European institutions to reassert their own, much more direct, hegemony over the Baltic country by making it clear that their sanctions were not can be exploited to prevent the transit of civilian products to the Russian exclave by rail. Although Lithuania is an American vassal state, it is more of a European state when push comes to shove, as has been the case recently. Vilnius could not oppose the European Commission, so it stuck to their political clarification and thus acted against the will of Washington. This happened only because the ""Big Three"" found it unacceptable to provoke Russia in such a brazen manner, which in turn speaks for their comparatively more pragmatic attitude towards the Ukraine conflict."
22183	11	"Nonetheless, no one should be mistaken in assuming that this development implies a transatlantic rift between the EU and the US, as nothing of the sort can be observed. Rather, the EU unexpectedly resisted the US after the latter had provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc by using Lithuania for this purpose. This shows that America's top European vassals will accept just about anything their overlord asks of them, unless there is a risk that, in the worst case, it will trigger a direct conflict with Russia, as some feared that of the US orchestrated blockade of Lithuania against Kaliningrad threatened to do so. In such cases, the ""Big Three"" have demonstrated that they have the political will to act decisively against Washington's wishes."
22192	3	"Often referred to as a hate preacher and ""God's Kalashnikov,"" the man with the shaggy beard is the spiritual eminence of Russian war propaganda."
22192	5	"If Viktor Orbán hadn't recently prevented the Russian Orthodox Church's chief mufti from being put on the EU sanctions list, stricter measures against Moscow would probably have failed due to a Hungarian veto. Who is the man who makes no secret of his closeness to the Russian President and his war and even praises the dropping of cluster bombs as Christian charity in action? In the TITANIC interview, patriarch Kyrill, whose real name is ""Vladimir Heinz-Peter Gundjajew"", talks about his fondness for Swiss luxury watches, the effects of a possible ordeal against Putin and tells us which subtle and difficult to discover detail distinguishes him from historical crackpots like Iwan distinguishes from the terrible."
22192	7	"TITANIC: Your clergy, prior to your ordination, you were an active KGB agent for a long time. In the 1990s you made headlines as a ""tobacco metropolitan"" when the Orthodox Church imported cigarettes in bulk to Russia and you raked in billions selling butts. Doesn't such a history disqualify you for such an important and dignified office?"
22192	9	KYRILL: I must beg you! At the KGB, I learned from scratch everything I needed to hear confessions in terms of interrogation and torture techniques. And as for the fags: even after a few years, I still consider helping the Russians to stop ruining their livers drinking vodka and chain smoking instead as a service to people. I couldn't have known at the time that the ungrateful pack would simply do both.
22192	11	TITANIC: Already at the beginning of your career, as foreign representative of the Russian church, you denounced the 'postmodern arbitrariness' of the western world, which you accused of 'demonized euthanasia and abortions'. What exactly do you dislike about it?
22192	13	KYRILL: You know, active euthanasia is no stranger to me from my past with foreign intelligence. For people who suddenly no longer see any meaning in their lives because of the constant preoccupation with freedom of expression and basic democratic rights, a dash of Novichok can actually have a very liberating effect. And since you're talking about abortions, I ask you: In which Russia would we be living today if our mothers had aborted Putin, Lavrov and me instead of making good-hearted people out of us?
22192	15	TITANIC: We prefer not to answer that for health reasons. Changing the subject: According to the latest polls, just one percent of the Russian population considers you to be a morally relevant authority. That puts you behind even oil tycoons, nightclub owners and mafia godfathers. Even Ivan the Terrible would probably have better stats than you today. Isn't that devastating for a church leader?
22192	17	KYRILL: Of course, the way you say it sounds stupid. But you can also express it differently. Ninety-nine percent of Russians think I'm an absolute authority on immorality. I want someone to do that for me.
22192	19	TITANIC: You once had your $100,000 luxury Swiss watch retouched in an official photo. However, the graphic artists forgot to remove the reflection of the timepiece on the smooth tabletop, so that your weakness for filthy lucre became well known. That must have been pretty embarrassing for you...
22192	21	CYRILL: Embarrassing? I took over the 'Audemars Piquet in 18k rose gold case and platinum dial' from a man who could no longer bear the burden of wealth on his wrist and, by the way, for the same reasons also gave me his yacht, his Moscow penthouse apartment and the Ferrari fleet before permanently retiring to a Siberian gulag. To me, this disgusting wealth is a little like carrying the cross of Jesus to Calvary 24/7. Whoa, heavy! (moans)
22192	23	TITANIC: On the occasion of the Annunciation of Mary on March 25th, you always release a few doves of peace into the hazy Moscow sky in front of your official church. This year, for the first time, they didn't come back into the loft. What has become of the birds?
22192	25	KYRILL: They flew past the Kremlin, where a small military parade was being held. Comrade Putin just couldn't resist, the old rascal. But it didn't have to be surface-to-air missiles.
22192	27	TITANIC: In an interview you claimed that an invasion of the Ukraine was necessary to prevent gay parades from being held there. Quite apart from the fact that we cannot understand what bothers you about it. Isn't that a bit exaggerated as a reason for war?
22192	29	KYRILL: The problem is that things like this tend to come out in waves. It all starts with a gaudy parade through downtown Kiev and before you know it the Russian President is watching 'Brokeback Mountain' on DVD every night, our Secretary of State is welcoming Elton John and the Don Cossack Choir is dancing to the YMCA in Red Square.
22192	31	TITANIC: Gosh! But they know each other suspiciously well.
22192	33	KYRILL: (blushing and shifting in the chair nervously): Next question, please.
22192	35	"TITANIC: OK. In a letter, they wished Vladimir Putin ""strong health, peace of mind and abundant help from the Lord in his high and responsible service to the Russian people."" And if your supposedly anointed president is ""lightened when he shits"" - would you accept that as a sentence of God against a dictator and warmonger?"
22192	37	"KYRILL: As far as I know, the President only poops at home in a lightning-proof ""Faraday cage"" for fear of ordeal. That's why he always looks so grumpy at official appearances outside the Kremlin. If the Creator's wrath should overtake him with his pants pulled up, I would actually take that as a sign from heaven."
22192	39	TITANIC: Ah. For what?
22192	41	KYRILL: That I should also seize political power and become an ayatollah of Moscow.
22192	43	TITANIC: You're crazy. Well then, thank you for the interview.
22193	3	Nusa Dua (dpo) - At the G20 meeting in Bali, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made serious allegations against the West. While Russia itself had no intention of invading Ukraine, it was NATO that pulled Russian tanks and soldiers onto Ukrainian territory with a powerful super magnet in February.
22193	5	"There is no other explanation, Lavrov said indignantly while holding up a graphic with a large horseshoe-shaped magnet. ""Why on earth should a peaceful country like Russia invade Ukraine? It was NATO's nasty super magnet that pulled our military across the border against its will. The West is to blame."""
22193	7	"Since then, Russia has been trying everything in its power to leave Ukraine. ""But the magnet is just too powerful,"" Lavrov explained. ""Our tanks and rocket launchers are constantly firing only to drop ballast."""
22193	9	"The exact location of the super magnet is currently unknown. ""We suspect, however, that he is in Kyiv. You can see that from our previous troop movements. I call on NATO to switch off this super magnet immediately! This behavior endangers world peace!"""
22196	3	Berlin (dpo) - What's going on with the job market? Arnold Menschenschinder complains that his company, MiesBezahlteDrecksjobs GmbH, has great difficulty finding capable employees at almost all locations in Germany.
22196	5	"Unbelievable, why can't we find anyone? complains the entrepreneur. ""We pay exactly the minimum wage, offer inflexible working hours, unpaid overtime and a lack of opportunities for advancement, and yet hardly anyone wants to start with us. I'm puzzled."""
22196	7	"The situation is similar for friendly entrepreneurs such as the boss of the OHG who founds a works council will be mobbed out, the BoniNurAnVorstand AG and the company We-educate-nobody-and-are-then-surprised-about-the-lack-of-young-trainees & sons. ""They don't find anyone either. It's really like a bewitchment!"""
22198	3	Hamburg, Palma (dpo) - It was only a matter of time before staff shortages and congestion at German airports would lead to dangerous mistakes. At Hamburg Airport on Thursday, a pilot was accidentally loaded into the cargo hold of a Boeing along with his luggage and had to spend the entire flight there while a suitcase on wheels steered the machine to Mallorca.
22198	5	"Yes, well... Something has gotten totally mixed up there, admits a person in charge of the airport contritely. ""We can be really happy that everything went smoothly."""
22198	7	Exactly who botched it is still being determined. The only thing that is clear is that the pilot who was actually scheduled for the flight was not allowed past the security checkpoint to his machine, as is usually the case, but was picked up and loaded as luggage.
22198	9	When the Boeing 737 was finally ready to take off after a 40-minute delay, a trolley case that was actually intended for the hold was apparently on the pilot's seat.
22198	11	"That also struck me as odd, explains co-driver Peter Kahle. ""But I thought to myself that the airlines would know what they were doing and who they were assigning where. So I just let the trolley do its job. Most of the time the autopilot does most of it anyway. But of course I would have intervened if necessary."""
22198	13	"In fact, the flight to Palma de Mallorca was largely trouble-free. Only the usual announcements (""If you look out the window on the left now, you would see Mont Blanc if it weren't so cloudy."") were missed by some of the 140 passengers."
22198	15	"The landing was also described by some vacationers as ""a bit jerky""."
2224	3	Last December, 1,000 people in Austria, Flanders, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Hungary were questioned about asylum and immigration on behalf of the EU Group “Identity & Democracy”.
2224	5	Europeans pretty much agree
2224	7	Although the crucial question of whether Europeans generally want or reject immigration from other continents was not asked, all the other answers show that the EU and most of the member states are not doing what the public wants. Because this is clear: the majority has had enough of immigration.
2224	9	Only respondents from the Netherlands feel that their opinion on the immigration issue is taken into account. All other respondents do not see it that way, so they are aware of the fact that the government is acting against the will of the citizens.
2224	11	Hungarians and Austrians particularly critical
2224	13	The EU is planning, without ever having asked the citizens for their consent, to admit at least (!) 70 million immigrants to Europe in the next few years. Sure, because those affected reject it, as the survey shows.
2224	15	To the cryptic question of whether “Europe can collectively absorb the envisaged minimum of 70 million migrants over the next few years”, the majority answered unequivocally: no. After Hungarians, Austrians are the second least likely to believe that Europe “can do it” (two-thirds of respondents).
2224	17	Demand for a cost-benefit calculation
2224	19	"The answer to the suggestive question of whether one supports the ""relocation of migrants from other EU member states to their own country"" is answered unequivocally by those concerned: only Spain and Italy, which have so far very successfully passed on their illegal immigrants to the north , can imagine that. Everyone else doesn't."
2224	21	"All respondents are in favor of better border security, and all would like to know what ""public costs and/or economic gains from migration"" their country has experienced. An absolute majority of respondents from all countries believe that their government should limit immigration of people without professional qualifications."
2230	3	EU Council Presidency Reform backlog, debt, global sovereignty. Emmanuel Macron has many plans for the EU - but will he be able to implement them?
2230	5	"There is no denying Emmanuel Macron's desire to take risks. He indicates that he wants to fight with Europe and as a European for the next presidency. And that with the EU nihilism of nationalist, ultra-right opponent candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. All the more so does the Élysée see the Council Presidency that has just begun as an impetus to free a united Europe from its reform backlog and, if necessary, to brush against the grain. Macron also wants to persuade the heads of government of the other 26 member states to give the EU more global sovereignty. It is important to ensure that this union of states does not fall behind the USA, China and Russia in terms of ranking. ""We must come to a Europe that is strong in the world, free to choose and master of its own destiny,"" said the President. In his view, strategic weight is essential for the EU to emancipate itself from the USA and NATO, because that benefits its internal constitution."
2230	7	"Macron could hardly have escaped the fact that his country only leads the European Council, not the entire EU. In any case, with an agenda of self-empowerment, he will encounter resistance from staunch Atlanticists in Germany and unshakable friends of America in Eastern Europe. Since the Scholz government has devoted itself less to the imperial aura and more to the internal metamorphosis of the EU, conflicts with Paris are foreseeable. In their coalition agreement, they advocate a constituent convention dedicated to the ""further development of the European Union into a federal European state"". That sounds suspiciously like the ""finalization"" of integration that Green Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made a goal of in his speech at Berlin's Humboldt University on May 12, 2000. Even then, the alternative – federal state or confederation of states – was in the air. This was done when the constitutional treaty, which paved the way for final integration, failed in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. If Germany seriously wants to revive what was, the election campaigner Macron will have no choice but to mutate from a European to a Frenchman and to warn against going astray."
2230	9	France, perfect lobbyist
2230	11	For him, these are also taken with the European financial system. France has long been suspicious of the rigid Maastricht criteria for accepting debt from the euro states. It is now being argued that the necessary state investments for a more climate-friendly economy will only be made if budgets and finances are adjusted. It is ridiculous to stick to budget rules when the final climate collapse is imminent.
2233	3	"Once again, not only ""conspiracy theorists"" and reputable scientists are confirmed, who in countless studies confirm the extensive ineffectiveness of the corona vaccinations against virus transmission. Even independent media such as OUR CENTRAL EUROPE should be right, in contrast to the hacks in the mainstream media."
2233	4	It is clear that the government also knows this, because otherwise people would not be ordered to wear masks despite vaccinations and tests. In this article, we do not want to go into the other reasons why we are forced to wear masks, nor whether wearing a mask makes sense at all, if not even harmful under certain circumstances.
2233	6	Total failure of the vaccination campaigns can no longer be denied
2233	8	Let's turn to the comments of the head of Pfizer. In a video, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla expresses what can no longer be covered up: namely the obvious total failure of previous vaccination campaigns.
2233	10	At the same time, the development of a new vaccine is announced, which should offer every imaginable security: immunity with simultaneous effect against new variants and, to calm down, maximum protection against any disease progression. This jack of all trades vaccines should then replace conventional vaccines from April. Nobody can say at the moment whether this will work this time, or whether another flop will just flush billions into the coffers of the pharmaceutical lobby - not even the Pfizer boss. We guess no, because the terror of disciplining is supposed to continue and the pharmaceutical lobby will certainly not stop the permanent re-vaccination of its own accord.
2233	12	Until then, the now officially ineffective stuff, which was bought for billions and can no longer be got rid of, is to be “vaccinated” quickly. Otherwise, the billion-dollar fraud threatens to be exposed even more quickly.
2237	1	"The war did not fall from the sky! (I) - ""By the grace of God America won the Cold War!"""
2237	3	The people of Russia may be for or against Putin or the current war against Ukraine. They may be old communists or new rich, Soviet nostalgic, 'Westerner' or pan-Slavist. Skilled workers, professors, shop assistants, the unemployed or pensioners. They may live in the Black Earth Region, in the Volga Delta, Transbaikalia, Udmurtia, Yakutia or in the Komi Republic. One sentence drives them all crazy:
2237	5	"""The Soviet Union lost the Cold War!"""
2237	7	Indeed, the brash cheering triumphalism of certain Western circles has done much to put Russia and the West back in a second Cold War and extremely dangerous new arms race long before Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. And it is indicative of the mental and moral level of the people who utter this sentence so quickly that they are apparently only able to think in terms of victory and defeat! - But one after anonther.
2237	9	Provisional restraint
2237	11	When the Berlin Wall fell in autumn 1989 and the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe swept away the communist dictatorships, the US administration under George H.W. Bush back diplomatically. It was clear in Washington that any loud Western cheering would only have damaged the further course of events. Eventually, cataclysmic events such as a possible reunification of Germany were already on the horizon, and they were not to be jeopardized under any circumstances. Thus, initially, all demonstrative gestures that could have had a humiliating effect on the people of the Soviet Union were refrained from - while the 'Russian separatist' and later gravedigger of the country, Boris Yeltsin, was already promoted clandestin[1]! On November 21, 1990, George Bush senior, together with 31 other heads of state and government, signed the “Charter of Paris”, which in its central and epoch-making sentence: “Security is indivisible, and the security of each participating state is inseparably linked to that of all others ' broke with the rivalry of thought and action, with the potentially world-destroying politics of the superpowers' zero-sum game. This ended the Cold War.
2237	13	At least that's what the world thought.
2237	15	The coming out
2237	17	"But just a month after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bush - coincidentally during the election campaign - could no longer contain himself and on January 28, 1992 at the beginning of his annual 'State of the Union Address'[2] before Congress, he literally burst out out: The world has seen changes of truly biblical proportions in the past twelve months. Nothing less than communism itself died that year. And for a long time he, the President, had not had the opportunity ""to show the joy that was in my heart"" because he was so busy with these changes and all the progress. But, now everyone should prick up their ears! ""The biggest thing"" that has ever happened in his life and in the lives of others is this: ""By the grace of God America won the Cold War!"" (By the way: Dass he also held no less than God personally responsible for this stupid historical lie, which gives this remark a particularly embarrassing note.)"
2237	19	"No sentence has proven to be as fatal for Western-Russian relations as this one! This sentence already contains the seeds of the following American policy of unilateralism, the ""single world power"", NATO eastward expansion, the policy of regime change, aggressive wars contrary to international law, the termination of almost all disarmament and arms control treaties. And it proves that the man who said it, and all those who later parroted it thoughtlessly with proud chests and acted according to its logic, were apparently too mentally limited and morally too irresponsible to even grasp the decisive factor."
2237	21	Playful trust
2237	23	Without the revolutionary policies of the Soviet administration at the time, i.e. without the policies of New Thinking - then as now decades ahead of its time because it puts the interests of all of humanity above the deadly rivalry of the superpowers - the Cold War would never have ended peacefully! Mikhail Gorbachev, the architect of this revolutionary change in foreign and armament policy thinking and acting, puts it this way:
2237	25	“The end of the Cold War was our common victory. It came about through dialogue and negotiation on the most complex security and disarmament issues and through establishing bilateral relations. Without all of this, the Cold War and arms race could have continued for a few more decades. And who knows what that could have led to!”
2237	27	But unfortunately it didn't stop there.
2237	29	“Instead of acknowledging all this, the West declared itself the winner. The end of the Cold War - for him that was only completed with the end of the Soviet Union. American statesmen called this a policy of strength. And concluded from this that it was now necessary to further expand one's own military power, to enforce one's own will, to create a unipolar world, an American empire. Now the world had to watch as the trust capital accumulated in the 1980s was gambled away, as instead of a new, secure world order, the specter of a new chaos emerged in which the law of the strongest prevailed. On the other hand, the Charter of Paris, the ideas of collective security, the creation of a Security Council for Europe, which were seriously discussed in 1991, were forgotten.”
2237	31	Today we are standing in front of the ruins of this development.
2237	33	The Cold Warriors lost the Cold War
2237	35	Let's set things right once and for all. The first Cold War could be ended because the then Soviet administration around Mikhail Gorbachev had previously defeated nothing less than the logic of the arms race itself in thought and action! And this is exactly what made it possible for the West, which was initially reluctant, to completely scrap the most dangerous short- and medium-range weapons and force nuclear disarmament worldwide by 80 percent.
2237	37	"The Russians are still very aware of this. A little tip: Just go for a ride - yes, it's also possible now! – to Russia and ask the first Russian you come across. He'll tell you, ""We ended the Cold War!"""
2237	39	In a word: it was the Cold Warriors who lost the Cold War. And the rest of humanity won it!
2250	3	Data scientist and graduate student Emily Burns compiled a body of evidence she posted to Twitter that shows the ten most vaccinated states now have about 400 percent more cases compared to last year.
2250	5	While case rates were about the same between vaccinated and unvaccinated states over the past year at the precise time the shots were first introduced under Operation Warp Speed, things have changed since then.
2250	7	"Now that all that Fauci flu juice has had a chance to do its damage in the bodies of the ""fully vaccinated"" people, the ill effects of vaccination have never been clearer."
2250	9	"""If we look at 10 MOST VAXED states and 10 LEAST VAXED states, we see that when comparing the year % change, there is practically NO DIFFERENCE..."" Burns tweeted."
2250	11	"""Also that the 10 most vaped NOW have nearly 400% HIGHER cases than last year when the 10 Least vaped were up 'only' 112%."""
2250	13	"In other words, cases of the Fauci flu have increased dramatically since Donald ""Father of the Vaccine"" Trump's injections made it into the arms of tens of millions of Americans."
2250	15	"""The large difference (nearly 4x) b/n % increase in YoY cases b/n 10 most vaxed and 10 least vaxed can be explained by vaxe's negative efficacy (increased likelihood of infection) for Omicron,"" Burns added."
2250	21	"""Neg potency means more vax = more cases - what we're seeing."""
2250	22	Most vaccinated states also experience differential increases in deaths, while deaths in the least vaccinated states decrease
2250	24	In Ontario, Can. for example, negative efficacy of the vaccine is now reported after the first two doses. This means that people lose immunity after ingestion.
2250	25	States with the highest Covid vaccination rates also have the highest increases in omicron cases!
2250	27	"""Receiving 2 doses of COVID-19 vax does not protect against omicron infection at any time point,"" one study further found."
2250	29	Another serious concern is the recent divergence in mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated states. It turns out that the most vaccinated states are seeing a sudden spike in deaths, while deaths in the least vaccinated states are now declining.
2250	31	Burns goes on to explain that immunization rates in most states are 65 percent or higher in the age group. On average, 95-99 percent of this age group have received at least one dose.
2250	33	"""The diff between single vax and double vax in 65+ probably isn't due to some kind of late-burgeoning anti-vax sentiment,"" says Burns. “It's probably due to bad rxns. [Increased] spread means [increased] risks for these fragile people.”"
2250	35	"""Given repeated studies showing negative vax efficacy - immediately in the case of Omicron, the current push to confuse anyone, including children, who are not at risk and previously infected, the elderly who are two [sic] fragile, quite enough to endanger two cans.”"
2250	37	The situation is a mess to say the least - especially with jab mandates denting on every side. It is undeniably clear that the injections decrease health and increase sickness and death. The question is: will the masses ever finally object to this mass genocide?
2250	39	"""Omicron is an excuse to cover up vaccine damage,"" one commenter wrote of the situation."
2250	41	"""The Fraudci narrative is crumbling,"" wrote another."
2250	43	"""We're talking about a cold,"" someone else chimed in, presumably referring to Omicron. ""That's crazy!"""
2250	45	"""So the only thing the jab does is give you side effects for the rest of your life... snake oil!"" wrote another. ""That's why Pfizer and Moderna canceled the control groups."""
2252	3	Washington. It is an open declaration of bankruptcy by the supposedly “sole world power”: the White House now felt compelled to declare an energy emergency for the USA. In a press statement, US President Joe Biden announced on Monday that the electricity supply in the US could no longer be fully guaranteed. The president suggests that the war in Ukraine and climate change are to blame.
2252	5	"According to the information service provider Bloomberg, the blackout risk in Europe, parts of Asia and the USA has increased significantly from mid-June. The White House press release said: ""Several factors threaten the ability of the United States to provide sufficient power generation to meet anticipated customer demand. These factors include disruptions to energy markets caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.”"
2252	7	"The increased import of solar cells from Southeast Asia should now remedy the situation. The White House expects, according to the press release, ""that additions of solar capacity and batteries will account for more than half of the new capacity of the electric sector in 2022 and 2023."""
2257	3	"Apparently, our politicians have known for a long time what to think of the ""measures"". While passengers on the train have to reckon with reprimands if they refuse to wear a mask, politicians are apparently immune to any virus - and show themselves without a mask on the train."
2257	5	You don't have to go all the way to Sweden. A trip to the Netherlands is enough to rediscover that relaxed normality that we also enjoyed in this country before there was that crisis that German politicians in particular made it their task to exploit. With the Dutch neighbors, the only ones who let the fresh sea air filter their mouths and noses with mostly unhygienic masks are probably German tourists. And while in this country people keep their distance with a surly look when someone uncovered approaches, people in neighboring countries are friendly and relaxed. Not a trace of the panic pandemic that is still gripping public life in Germany, not just in doctor's offices or buses and trains.
2257	7	The German subject seems to have gotten used to the piece of cloth in front of his face. After all, spring is not only followed by summer, but also by autumn, which brings us a new, much more! A lot of! more dangerous virus threatens. At least that's what a health minister tells the citizens, who has been busy for years accelerating the conditions that threaten to overwhelm the health system with every flu outbreak: closing hospitals, reducing beds, scaring away nurses. The crisis being talked about is homemade, so it's better to blame it on a virus.
2257	9	"And the pressure has to be kept up. Otherwise you would have to admit that you were wrong. The virus was neither particularly deadly nor did the vaccines deliver what they promised. Rather the opposite. The supposedly life-saving “measures” often turned out to be more harmful than what they were intended to prevent. It's actually - amazing! - penetrated to the otherwise so government-loyal ""Spiegel"". Yes, indeed: not only does the vaccination not protect against infection, it also does not protect anyone from infecting others. And it seems to have massive side effects in many cases. All in all scandalous - and to this day not systematically cleared up. Doctors shy away from the not inconsiderable effort of passing on the suspicion of vaccination damage to the Paul Ehrlich Institute. But they may not do it because they fear they will be pilloried as “corona deniers”. Many of those affected are now resorting to self-help."
2257	11	The so-called pandemic deserves the name panic pandemic. But as such it seems to be as valuable as gold, and therefore it must not run out.
2257	12	"It looks as if our politicians have long known what to think of both the alleged pandemic and the ""measures"". While passengers on the train can expect to be rudely expelled from the train if they refuse to wear a mask, politicians are immune to any virus, they just can't tell anyone."
2257	14	They dutifully perform the ritual in the Bundestag or in the federal press conference of approaching the lectern with a mask, putting it down there and putting it on again for the short walk back. But then!
2257	16	Cem Özdemir studying files on the train – without a mask. And no, he wasn't secretly photographed, he published the photo himself on his Twitter account. Justin Trudeau in close conversation with fellow politicians, faces very close together, uncovered. The ex-Chancellor in an intimate conversation with her admirer, the mirror journalist Alexander Osang: without a mask. You understand each other a little better without it.
2257	18	And so on. Quod licet jovi, non licet bovi. Terrorizing the citizen and then repeatedly failing to comply with any of the supposedly essential life-saving measures is what is usually called double standards. The reactions of more and more people who were good mask wearers until then are corresponding. So far they have gone through everything, trusting in the right decisions of far-sighted politicians - who are now sticking their tongues out at them.
2257	20	Because they know more than their subjects? Because you have an idea of ​​how the report of the expert committee, in which the corona measures are to be evaluated, will turn out? It looks like not a single measure there will pass as effective - except, maybe, wearing a mask indoors. In this respect, Cem Özdemir is not off the hook.
2257	22	And that's why: let's just take him as a role model! Be like a Dutchman, be like Cem!
2264	3	The Russian President delivers his speech at the annual SPIEF economic forum in St. Petersburg. His speech is about the future of Russia and the rest of the world in the face of renewed pressure from Western sanctions against Moscow.
2264	5	"Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the unipolar world is at an end, although its beneficiaries are trying to preserve it at all costs. The President added that after the end of the Cold War, the US declared that its national interests were ""sacred"" and should not be undermined."
2264	7	"The so-called ""golden billion"" still think they are superior and see the rest of the world as their colonies. He added that the Western ruling elites live in a dream world and refuse to see the global changes."
2264	9	"""In recent decades, new powerful centers have formed on the planet [...] each of them develops its own political system and public institutions, implements its own models of economic growth and, of course, has the right to protect itself and the to ensure national sovereignty. We are talking about real processes here, about really revolutionary, tectonic changes in geopolitics, the world economy, technology, in the whole system of international relations""."
2264	11	Putin accused Western countries of deliberately undermining the foundations of the international order in order to gratify their geopolitical illusions. He pointed out that corporate reputations and confidence in currencies were being eroded by their actions. The President also pointed out that the US can steal money from an individual, group or state just because Washington doesn't approve of something.
2264	13	EU has lost sovereignty, harms own citizens with anti-Russia sanctions
2264	15	"The Russian president has criticized the European Union's decision to impose anti-Russia sanctions, calling it ""crazy"" and ""not well thought out"". Putin said the aim of the sanctions was to destroy Russia's economy in one fell swoop, but they failed to do so."
2264	17	"Instead, EU politicians have dealt their own economy a serious blow, which has led to high inflation, the President stressed. He estimated the cost of the ""sanctions madness"" at around $400 billion this year alone, noting that the measures are becoming a burden on citizens."
2264	19	The Russian President said the EU had lost its political sovereignty as its elites danced to another country's tune, even at the cost of harming their own European populations and business interests. Putin predicted that this would lead to a deepening of financial inequalities and social divisions in European societies. It is possible that this will eventually lead to a rise in radicalism and a change in elites in the bloc.
2264	21	"Putin added that global price hikes and energy problems are the direct result of failed US and EU policies. The President dismissed the terms ""Putin's tax"" and ""Putin's inflation"" used by Western politicians, particularly US President Joe Biden, to explain rising fuel and consumer prices. The Russian president claimed that only uneducated people would believe the fairy tales that Russia's actions in the Donbass are driving up prices."
2264	23	At the same time, Putin stressed that Western countries' forecasts about the bleak prospects for the Russian economy did not materialize.
2264	25	“It's clear why they ran this propaganda campaign, what all the talk about ruble-dollar exchange rates of 200 to 1 and the claims that our economy would collapse was all about. All of this was and is a means of information warfare, an attempt to psychologically pressure Russian society.”
2264	27	He stressed that despite sanctions, foreign pressure and Russia's strategy of substituting foreign imports with domestic production, the Russian economy will never become self-sufficient – ​​an isolated economy with no or only limited economic ties to other countries.
2264	29	To Ukraine
2264	31	The Russian President separately addressed Ukraine, where Moscow is currently conducting a special military operation. Putin promised that Russia would support Ukrainians in the areas under his control and give them the opportunity to decide their own fate, and that Moscow would respect this decision.
2264	33	He pointed out that military action is always a tragedy, but stressed that Moscow was forced to act. The president added that unlike US actions in Libya or Iraq, the Russian special operation is perfectly legitimate - a statement the West denies.
2264	35	Putin continued his criticism of the US, accusing it of building an anti-Russian base - something Washington would never tolerate in adjacent areas. The President went on to say that the White House should have pushed for new elections in Ukraine in 2014 instead of giving gifts to the opposition and backing the coup in February of that year.
2264	37	The President also commented on the course of Russian special operations. He explained that the decisions about attacks on the decision-making centers of Ukraine, especially on Kyiv, are made by the military commanders and not by him personally. He went on to say that Russian troops are avoiding storming the Ukrainian fortifications in Donetsk to avoid major casualties and instead are trying to encircle them. Putin added that Ukrainian forces holed up in these forts are using them to shell civilian areas of the Donetsk People's Republic.
2267	1	Are You Prepared for the Coming Food Disaster?
2267	3	"All over the world, experts and analysts are now warning of skyrocketing food prices and catastrophic food shortages. In mid-May 2022, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres declared that the world was facing years of famine and called on Russia to ""enable the safe export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports"" to alleviate the shortages."
2267	5	Officially, the global food shortage is blamed on “climate change”, the COVID pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But while all of these factors have played a part, other factors are also contributing to the stretching of our food system.
2267	7	Death by a thousand cuts
2267	9	At least 20 food processing plants went up in flames between January 2021 and April 2022, and a number of barn fires also affected farmers. While most of these fires have been traced to equipment or safety deficiencies, and fact-checkers insist that fires are common in these types of farms, there were only two such fires in 2019, and at least some of the barn fires in late 2021 were suspected to be arson.
2267	11	In 2020, wildfires also destroyed a number of farms, and in early 2022, outbreaks of bird flu in poultry resulted in the culling of millions of chickens, ducks and turkeys.
2267	13	"In March 2021, a giant container ship became bogged down in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking ""an artery of world trade,"" triggering a spike in oil prices and impacting shipping around the world."
2267	15	More recently, the United States has experienced an infant formula shortage triggered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shutting down one of the manufacturing plants that are part of the US infant formula monopoly.
2267	17	In response to the EU's decision to exclude seven of Russia's nine banks from the SWIFT system, Russia is also holding back fertilizer exports, and anyone who wants to buy Russian oil or gas has to pay in rubles.
2267	19	In addition to the fertilizer shortages and resulting price hikes triggered by Russia's export ban, Union Pacific (whose main investors include BlackRock) is also restricting fertilizer shipments by rail, causing delivery delays and higher prices. Also recently, a Canadian Pacific freight train carrying potash (an important fertilizer ingredient) derailed in Alberta, Canada.
2267	21	President Biden's decision to decouple the United States from energy independence by shutting down the Keystone pipeline, terminating offshore oil leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and freezing new federal oil and gas drilling leases and permits is also significant not helpful.
2268	3	United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has pointed to a lack of support for non-Ukrainian refugees. Syria, Afghanistan and several African countries also continue to need humanitarian aid, the UN official said.
2268	5	Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has expressed concern that increasing aid to Ukraine could undermine humanitarian assistance to other needy regions around the world. He explained this on Friday in an interview with the television station NHK.
2268	7	While supporting the active collection of aid for refugees and internally displaced people in Ukraine, Grandi expressed concern at the lack of support for people in similar situations in Afghanistan, Syria and other countries in need:
2268	9	"""These funds may have been diverted from relief funds destined for other countries. Existing problems in other regions are often ignored."""
2268	11	With a view to the global food problems, the UN Commissioner warned of a possible worsening of the situation on the African continent:
2268	13	"""Africa's precarious regions are not only affected by conflict and poverty, but also by climate change. When you add food shortages to this, it's no wonder that more and more people are being forced to leave."""
2268	15	The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported at the end of May that the number of refugees and internally displaced persons who were driven from their homes due to armed conflicts, violence and persecution exceeded the 100 million mark for the first time worldwide. The department said the number of forcibly displaced people in the world rose to 90 million at the end of 2021 due to new waves of violence or protracted conflicts in countries such as Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nigeria.
2269	3	In an Instagram video, the German icon of the climate movement jokes about possible terrorist attacks on the African oil pipeline EACOP. The project is intended to supply East Africa with energy.
2269	5	"And of course we're thinking about how we can blow up the pipeline.” Luisa Neubauer and a colleague laugh. These are scenes that raise the face of ""Fridays for Future"" on Instagram. Neubauer is in Copenhagen to protest against the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipe Line (EACOP). ""To blow up"" - that can of course also be interpreted as ""prevent"" to talk your way out."
2269	7	The bad joke has several dimensions. Because how clever it is, as one of the leading figures of climate extremism, to trumpet such ideas towards a radical audience, is an invitation in view of the attacks on everyday life that are actually taking place. Neubauer does the Böhmermann: what you think is said, then disguised as satire in order to be unassailable - although you actually mean what you say.
2269	9	The tone has become harsher since the coronavirus crisis stole the limelight and made demonstrations more difficult. Neubauer and Greta Thunberg are no longer as present as they used to be. Clear announcements are needed. Der Spiegel allowed the climate extremist Andreas Malm, who used the reach of the Hamburg magazine to call for violence in the name of his ideology. Neubauer's casual idea also fits in with the spirit of the times.
2269	11	The said pipeline is destined for the Third World. It is to pump oil from the Indian Ocean to Uganda, where a refinery is to supply the East African coast. Uganda is considered one of the poorest countries in the world. The construction of the pipeline will provide jobs for 15,000 people, and when it is completed the project is expected to offer 1,000 to 2,000 permanent jobs. Cheap energy should become a stepping stone for the region. The pipeline is considered the longest heated crude oil pipeline in the world.
2270	3	"Western anti-Russia policy is aimed at causing lasting damage to the Russian economy through sanctions and the refusal of further Russian energy imports. Federal Foreign Minister Baerbock (Greens) expressly stated in February that the aim of the measures was to ""ruin"" Russia."
2270	5	After around a hundred days of war in Ukraine, it is clear that the western sanctions are a real boomerang. Not only have they created acute energy shortages in the West, they have also made Russian oil and gas revenues spurt in more than ever before. According to a US government representative, Russian energy revenues are currently higher than just before the Ukraine war. US special envoy for energy security Amos Hochstein said at a hearing that this was because global price increases were offsetting the effects of Western sanctions restricting energy sales.
2275	3	Moscow (dpo) - Russia's economy is on the rocks, the ruble is in free fall, thousands of young soldiers are dead, international isolation: these are just some of the results of the war of aggression against Ukraine. Reason enough to ask the question: why does Vladimir Putin hate Russia so much that he is so willing to harm it?
2275	5	"All of Putin's behavior currently indicates that he wants to destroy Russia and the future of the people living there as sustainably as possible and for decades to come, explains psychologist and conflict researcher Bastian Fenten. ""It would be his job as president to make sure that the Russian people are doing well. Instead, he seems to hate it abysmal."""
2275	7	So what is behind Putin's hatred of Russia? Has Russia done anything bad to him in the past? Take away his lunch every day? run over his dog? Is Putin even a double agent of the West? Or is anti-Russian racism the reason why he lets his compatriots die and drives them into poverty?
2275	9	"The only thing that seems clear is that a spontaneous misjudgment of the situation cannot be the reason for Putin's actions. ""If that were the case, he could have ended the war immediately and withdrawn his troops. Instead, he seems to be intensifying his war effort and the atrocities that accompany it, making Russia's situation even worse,"" Fenten said."
2284	3	"Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau is behaving like a tyrant, like a dictator, Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes said at a press conference on Friday. ""He's acting like Ceausescu in Romania,"" he said."
2284	5	“If you cast doubt on vaccines, you will be ostracized. What is the difference between what he is doing now and what happened at the time of the Inquisition?” Terhes asked.
2284	7	"“On the one hand they say you shouldn't believe in God, but on the other hand they say you should believe in science. Science is not about belief, it is about measurements, conclusions, hypotheses and arguments. We are now at a point where if you have doubts, you get labeled,” said the MP. ""It's not OK."""
2284	9	"Terhes spoke to a number of Canadian truckers whom he thanked at the press conference. ""I hope this freedom movement spreads around the world because we need to make sure that all elected officials understand that they were elected to work for the people and not to behave like slave owners."""
2284	11	"Tesla boss Elon Musk had previously compared Trudeau to Hitler. He did so in a tweet that he later deleted. Musk posted a picture of Hitler with the caption, ""Don't compare me to Justin Trudeau. I had a budget."" The Government of Canada's Prime Minister has not presented a budget for 2019 and 2020."
2287	1	A failed growth model
2287	2	Associations and activists demonstrate against climate change, war and injustice on the sidelines of the G7 summit
2287	4	"Munich's Theresienwiese at lunchtime on Saturday: an activist disguised as a panda bear holds up a sign in front of the stage. ""Energy transition now even more so,"" reads it. Behind it, the globe floats as a balloon under the blue sky and »Save the climate!« is written on it. It is a broad alliance that has gathered here to protest. Attac is there as well as the Bund Naturschutz, Oxfam Germany, Greenpeace, Campact, Misereor and the Action Against Hunger. The appeals are aimed at the heads of state and government meeting at Schloss Elmau near Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of the G7 summit."
2287	6	"With a demonstration through downtown Munich, the alliance of 15 civil society organizations is calling for decisive action to be taken against the climate crisis and species extinction. ""We will take to the streets and keep fighting until we live in a climate-friendly world,"" said Lisa Göldner from Greenpeace at the opening rally."
2287	8	"The representatives of the youth organizations mobilize on stage under the motto »G7 – Justice can be done differently«. Beccy from the Bund Naturschutz BN-Jugend calls for system change instead of climate change. Ilayda from the WWF youth says: ""I'm afraid for our future"" and Luca from the nature conservation youth NaJu Bavaria says: ""We can't just talk, we have to act"". From the G7 meeting he demands responsibility for a ""binding agreement on climate and species protection"". Viviane Raddatz from the WFF asks: ""What are you doing to become faster in climate and species protection?"" The solutions are there, but are being implemented much too slowly. You need binding resolutions to get out of coal and gas."
2287	10	"In addition to climate change and species protection, the war in Ukraine is also a topic at the rally. ""Imperialism begins here: let's attack it,"" reads a black bloc banner. In the run-up to the G7 summit, there were arson attacks on police cars in Munich, from which the »Stop G7 Elmau« alliance distanced itself. ""End the war,"" reads another banner; ""Solidarity with the Ukrainian workers and popular masses"" on a poster."
2287	12	"Climate change and war were also the reasons why 29-year-old Max and his 27-year-old friend Hendrik came from Leipzig to Munich for the big demonstration. Max is studying to become a teacher and says: ""I thought we wouldn't have to deal with war anymore, now we're very close."" Developments in China and climate change also worry him a lot. And yes, he does believe that ""the demo will do something,"" you could see that with ""Fridays for Future."" The two also want to be present at the protests in Garmisch-Partenkirchen against the policies of the seven state leaders."
2287	14	The breadth of the alliance against the G7 make clear various statements in the run-up to the large demo. Elisabeth Waizenegger from the Working Group for Farmers and Dairy Farmers from Bavaria explains: »G7 states, finally say goodbye to your failed agricultural world market orientation! We need regional systems worldwide that offer women farmers prospects, feed everyone and protect the climate and biodiversity - with fair prices and fair access to land and seeds.«
2287	16	Roland Süss, member of the Attac coordination group, announces: »The G7 are backing a failed growth model that they are imposing on the rest of the world. The result is social division – worldwide. In order to solve the multiple crises globally, we need a multilateralism that goes beyond national logic and gives the Global South decisive influence.«
2287	18	Sven Hilbig from Bread for the World says: »The G7 share responsibility for many current crises and the ongoing exploitation of the Global South. We don't need the club culture of the industrialized nations, but a fair development policy and structural changes that are supported by the entire international community.« And Christine Margraf from the Bund Naturschutz in Bayern states: »Besides global warming, the extinction of species is the biggest global crisis on our planet. At their meeting, the G7 states must finally lay the foundation stone for a globally binding agreement on the conservation of biological diversity to be adopted before the end of this year.«
2287	20	According to the organizers, 6,000 people took part in the demonstration. At the G7 summit in Elmau seven years ago, there were 40,000 participants.
229	1	Cycling against Putin
229	3	There are many good reasons to cycle more often and not drive as often or as quickly. Everything is a gift and has been refined for decades. Recently, an extremely bad argument has been added: cycling or speeding up to 100 “against Putin”. Shortly before Easter, Robert Habeck issued the following slogan to the Funke media group: »Every kilometer not driven is a contribution to getting away more easily from Russian energy supplies. On top of that, we protect the climate.« (And, as chutzpah has to be, it »is easy on the wallet«.)
229	5	Neither of Habeck's arguments is correct. Firstly, you make yourself an idiot if you make a goal of the state the maxim of your own actions. Because those who cycle or dawdle “against Putin” are professing to be a self-confident cog in a great “national effort”. A contradiction. Secondly, the idea of ​​harming Putin with the petrol saved by cycling or dawdling is as dubious in its effectiveness as all acts of so-called consumer resistance. Even if millions followed it, it would be a typical ceteris paribus observation: the hoped-for effect would (perhaps) occur if nothing changed in the other framework conditions.
229	7	But do it, and do it from the side of those who are telling people this nonsense. The bicycle commuter has not the slightest influence on this. What a war like the one in Ukraine, including its prolongation by Western arms supplies, does to global CO2 emissions has not been attempted to be calculated with good reason. Because the answer is so obvious that the underlying question is ridiculous. War and climate are a topic that green climate and war friends like to avoid on a large scale.
2290	1	The fight for fundamental rights
2290	2	The criticism of Elon Musk's reach for Twitter shows that the much-quoted basic democratic values ​​are already partly history, at least in leading editorial offices
2290	4	Crazy: Someone announces that he will be in an influential position for freedom of speech and opinion on the Internet, and not only in Germany big media hit him. Moralism and self-righteousness have become so dominating discourse that a basic principle of democracy is being fired. This was also shown recently in the reports on Elon Musk's plans to take over Twitter and censor less there. One of the points of criticism was that the ideas of a rich white man in terms of freedom of expression are suspect in view of the degradation that minorities have to experience again and again online and offline. In addition, Musk is a big capitalist with who-knows-what plans.
2290	6	Anyone who rejects a takeover of Twitter by Musk for fear of the announced increase in freedom of speech has two blind spots. Firstly, this freedom is scandalously restricted on Twitter, secondly, the freedom of speech and opinion of our era is based on the capitalist impulse to level out traditional bondages.
2290	8	censorship scandals
2290	10	Anyone who has not yet criticized Twitter for its censorship measures has missed or forgotten important events on the platform. When it comes to the coronavirus, the curtailment of social discourse has only reached a new dimension. For example, some tweets that questioned the benefits of corona vaccinations claimed by governments or spoke of vaccine damage could not be disseminated, not even answered - even if they linked to a scientific study or a government statement, or even contained a simple question.
2290	12	The social network Facebook has even been publicly addressed by the renowned specialist magazine British Medical Journal since January. From the beginning, the magazine had published critical articles about the significance of the approval studies for the corona vaccines by Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna, and one of them was posted on Facebook with a warning and the threat that anyone who repeatedly linked something like this ran the risk of being blocked will. In November 2021, Facebook's sister platform Instagram blocked mention of the profile of the scientific Cochrane network, which enjoys a worldwide reputation for setting standards for the evaluation of medical studies. The reasoning was that Cochrane had “repeatedly published content that violates guidelines on false content about COVID-19 or vaccinations”. All of these censorship measures are anti-scientific.
2290	14	Social media as a political issue
2290	16	The suspicion is that Twitter and Facebook are sabotaging criticism of the suspension of fundamental rights over the past two years because they are benefiting from the officially prescribed online communication. But the censorship problem also exists independently of this. For example, three weeks before the last presidential election in the USA in 2020, both platforms prevented the distribution of the link to an article in the New York Post newspaper. Based on old e-mails from Hunter Biden, son of current President Joe Biden, he suggested that Hunter had only been given a lucrative post at a Ukrainian energy company so that his father, then US Vice President, would join the company by the Ukrainian government - which Joe Biden then did, whether intentionally or not. More than a month later, after the presidential election, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey described this censorship as a mistake. His platform had deactivated the New York Post profile for two weeks. In 2019, Twitter censorship was even an issue in the German Bundestag. In the run-up to the European Parliament elections, the platform had published guidelines against political misinformation and then blocked tweets without rhyme or reason. Here, among others, SPD politicians and the newspaper »Jüdische Allgemeine« were affected.
2290	18	Elon Musk's criticism of censorship on Twitter is therefore absolutely necessary. On the other hand, it is out of place to criticize his ideas of (free) speech as an expression of a capitalist mentality. Due to the equality of all of us before money and goods, capitalism has laid the basis for the modern understanding of fundamental rights. Liberalism is the associated body of thought, which, however, has become independent of its capitalist basis and made possible a generalization of basic rights. It has developed a life of its own, as happens again and again with political ideas. And it is often useful against existing bondages.
2291	3	Now the way is clear: Finland and Sweden will soon be members of NATO. But what exactly does that actually mean? And what does that have to do with Russia? Oh god, please don't ask such a stupid question, we'll explain it to you in detail! Here are the most important questions and answers about Finland and Sweden joining NATO:
2291	5	Where are Finland and Sweden?
2291	7	"Finland and Sweden are in northern Europe or, as geographers say, ""at the top of the map"". They're located on either side of the Gulf of Bothnia, putting them right in the European epicenter of salacious geographic puns."
2291	9	What is NATO?
2291	11	NATO (abbreviation for North AtlaNtic TreATy OrganizatiOn) is a purely defensive (with no more than provoking, spitting and pinching) alliance that was originally created as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO had no equal opponent for a long time and therefore concentrated on minor robbery and extortion crimes before an interesting despot finally reappeared in Vladimir Putin.
2291	13	And what is the OTAN?
2291	15	An extra sausage for the French, who like to pronounce abbreviations backwards (cf. ASU, FECINU, UE, GfM, BACA).
2291	17	Why weren't Sweden and Finland in NATO until now?
2291	19	For fear of Russia.
2291	21	Why do Sweden and Finland suddenly want to join NATO?
2291	23	For fear of Russia.
2291	25	What is the military performance of the two countries?
2291	27	Finland and Sweden each have a strong army. Particularly feared are the Swedish Elk Hussars (troop strength: 50,000) and Matti Hämäläinen from Helsinki, who is just a pretty scary guy.
2291	29	Can I also become a NATO member? How much is it?
2291	31	In theory, anyone can become a member of NATO as long as they don't live too far from the North Atlantic and promise to invest 2 percent of their salary in weapons. However, accession forms are only available at the NATO headquarters in Brussels.
2291	33	How does the admission of Sweden and Finland work?
2291	35	After all NATO members have agreed, the two new members only have to undergo the traditional, somewhat archaic initiation ritual. It stipulates that Sweden and Finland must run naked and blindfolded past all previous member states while they hit their behinds with paddles.
2291	37	What did Erdogan get for his approval?
2291	39	The admission of the two candidates had previously failed for weeks because of him: Recep Erdogan. According to reports, the Turkish president paid dearly for his current approval: Finland and Sweden have to massage his feet twice a week, serve snacks and drinks on demand and, like the rest of NATO, kindly shut up when Turkey bombs the Kurds again .
2291	41	What Erdogan hasn't considered, however, is that as soon as Sweden and Finland are in NATO, they can withdraw all concessions. Because once you're in NATO, you can't be thrown out. But shhh! – Erdogan is not allowed to know that now, of course.
2291	43	exceptionally. But only this once.
2291	45	Can the answer be at the top and the question at the bottom in this FAQ article?
2291	47	Why are Sweden and Finland allowed into NATO, but not Ukraine?
2291	49	There are two important reasons for this. For one thing, Sweden and Finland do not have a large enough Russian minority to goad Russia into a separatist state and then rush to its aid. On the other hand, Russia cannot currently attack Sweden and Finland because it is far too busy bombing Ukraine because it wanted to join NATO.
2291	51	How is Russia reacting to the candidacy of the two countries?
2291	53	"Due to the ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Russia is currently far too busy to respond adequately to this affront. However, Finland and Sweden each received a nuclear destruction and general destruction voucher to redeem from 2025."
2294	1	Prudery instead of Pride
2294	3	Once the largest queer parade in Southeast Europe, now a symbol of repression. As in previous years, Istanbul Pride Week was banned. It was supposed to take place from June 20th to 26th, with a colorful program consisting of lectures, discussions and speed dating events, ending with a big parade on Sunday.
2294	5	"The governors of Istanbul's Kadikoy and Beyoglu districts said that after police inspections of the venues for the 30th annual Pride Week, they decided not to allow events on the streets or in buildings. ""All events are banned in all open and closed areas for seven days,"" the governor's offices said in a statement. The ban was justified with the prevention of crime and the maintenance of peace and security. ""After the Taksim Gezi Park protests in 2013, we all decided that 'resistance' should be the theme of Pride Week,"" Es Yılmaz, a spokeswoman for the Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee, told Junge Welt on Wednesday."
2294	7	"The people who want to celebrate the LGBTI+ Pride Week are not only exposed to state repression and attacks by the police, religious fanatical groups are also mobilizing against them. The group Müdafaa-i İslam Hareketi (Movement for the Defense of Islam) called for a gathering in Taksim at 2:53 p.m. this Sunday, the day of the Pride parade. ""Protect your family, generation and city."" ""Say stop to perversion!"" the group wrote in a message on the short message service Twitter on Monday, which was commented on with numerous death threats against LGBTI+ people."
2294	9	After a large Pride parade with more than 100,000 participants in 2014, the Turkish authorities had always prohibited the move in recent years - officially for security reasons. »Pride Week 2014 was the largest LGBTI+ event in Turkey's history, attracting more than 100,000 people. In 2015, the Pride events were banned and our marches were blocked by the police,” Yilmaz complained to jW. Hundreds of people defied the ban and were attacked by the police with tear gas, protective shields, pepper gas and plastic bullets.
2294	11	"The repressive, right-wing conservative spirit of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Ankara is also spreading in the 15-million metropolis of Istanbul. ""You are responsible for all the violence we are experiencing,"" Yilmaz said in a jW interview. ""LGBTI+, that doesn't exist,"" said the Turkish President. Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu called homosexuals ""perverts,"" ""a senior health official compared us to pedophiles, and the top imam warned that we spread diseases,"" Yilmaz said. The government has arrested thousands of Kurdish politicians, human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists. »The Turkish government is also targeting LGBTI+ communities, but we refuse to back down.«"
2294	13	The İstanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee issued a statement on social media following Tuesday's ban decision. “The law enforcement officers tried to put pressure on the venues by demanding documents such as tax plates and signs for the venues where the event would be held. Despite the pressure, we met today at our venues.” The committee said the ban was unlawful and it would “use all rights and appeal as necessary.”

2296	1	sexism in politics
2296	3	"The upper house election planned for July 10 in Japan is sometimes referred to as a ""fateful election"" - half of the members of the house are alternately determined every three years. The reason for this are the plans of the right to lay hands on the peace constitution with a two-thirds majority. The hopes of pacifists are now increasingly pinned on the women among the »centre-left« candidates. In last Saturday's edition, the left-liberal daily Nikkan Gendai hoped for a ""hurricane of the Madonnas"" to prevent the right-wing forces in the upper house from achieving the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional amendment."
2296	5	In fact, this time there were more female candidates than ever before: 181, which corresponds to 33 percent of all candidates. For conservative Japan, these are extremely high numbers when you consider that in the lower house, which is endowed with more money, just under ten percent of the deputies are women. This puts Japan in 165th place out of 188 countries.
2296	7	Up until the 2009 general election, the proportion of women in parliament rose steadily before it began to stagnate. Many Japanese still believe that women belong at the stove and that the heavy workload of a politician keeps them from family responsibilities. In addition, a subtle sexism pervades society, which does not stop at politics.
2296	9	A good example is the case of Ayaka Shiomura in 2014. The then Tokyo MP was speaking at a plenary session about the need to provide better support for women with children in order to increase the birth rate when a colleague from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) shouted at her: »You should get married yourself.” Other heckling from men followed.
2296	11	"Investigations revealed that the incident was just the tip of the iceberg. Sexist remarks by politicians are the rule rather than the exception. In early June, Nikkan Gendai reported that a lawmaker from the right-wing Japan Innovation Party introduced a female candidate by saying, ""If you took the beauty of her face as a yardstick, she would be number one."" to play only the role of an appendage of the male ranks in right-wing parties. It is also significant that the parties like to recruit Japanese women who have become known through television or sports. The focus is not on the person, but on image cultivation."
2296	13	"""Last but not least, the election campaign is an obstacle to a woman's political career,"" Shiomura, who has been a member of the upper house for the left-liberal KDP for three years, told jW on June 14. This year it lasts around two and a half weeks: the candidates stand in squares and in front of train stations from morning to evening with temperatures of up to 40 degrees and try to attract the attention of passers-by with fiery speeches. Women in particular go to the limits of their resilience: Three years ago they suffered from a dizzy spell three times and twice their voice failed, Shiomura complained."
2296	15	"""And if women still make it into parliament, they have to struggle with male bureaucracy,"" the politician continued. Parliament is run by men, they decide who is allowed to speak when and on which topics. Nonetheless, Shiomura, who entered politics through animal welfare issues, has been able to make a difference in some areas such as fertility treatment and abortion."
2296	17	Only the next general elections will show whether this time the increase in the proportion of women among the candidates by around five percentage points compared to 2019 marks the beginning of a new trend. At least in the case of the LDP, however, there has not yet been a rethink: at 23 percent, their quota of female candidates is disappointing.

2610	1	OVER 1 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO US SINCE BIDEN IN POWER
2610	3	One can legitimately ask how can a head of state want to assert himself on the battlefields when he is not even able to control his own country? This seems to be the case of Joe Biden grappling with a problem that Americans feel is much more pressing than the conflict in Ukraine. According to a survey carried out by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, in first place in the concerns of Americans there would be inflation (31%), in second place uncontrolled immigration (10%), in third place electoral laws (8%) and only fourth is the conflict in Ukraine (7%). The feelings of the respondents to the polls are certainly not far-fetched, since in fact the Democrat Joe Biden is president of the United States the number of illegal immigrants in the country has increased by 1 million, costing the pockets of citizens 9.4 billion euros dollars. The data was relaunched by the broadcaster Fox News which obtained them from a study by the American Federation for Immigration Reform. Research estimates that there are about 15.5 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, up from 14.5 million in 2020. Other estimates put the number at around 11 million. The American Federation for Immigration Reform's analysis also conducted a study of the tax costs of the phenomenon, finding that illegal immigrants are imposing a net tax burden of at least $143.1 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion. dollars compared to 2020.
2610	4	"According to the study, the reasons for this increase in illegal immigration can be found in three factors. The first is the improvement of the American economy which has attracted hundreds of thousands of immigrants, especially from Latin America. Secondly, the reopening of the borders, expected by many after the health crisis from Covid19. This has poured into the United States a large number of illegal immigrants who were just waiting for Washington to reopen its borders. Finally, perhaps the most important reason, the fact that the Biden administration has canceled most of the laws enacted during the administration led by Donald Trump. To make a quick comparison, between 2016 and 2019 the number of immigrants who became permanent residents dropped by 13%, from 1.18 million to 1.03 million. The geographical area that shows the most this decline is Asia: immigration fell by 21%, from 450,000 to 350,000 people. Again between 2016 and 2019, arrivals from Yemen amounted to -71%; from Iraq to -67%; from Buthan to -63%; from Iran to -53%; from Somalia to -40%; from Pakistan to -29%; from Afghanistan to -16%. These data are the consequence of the travel bans (prohibition of movement) also known as the Muslim bans, the executive orders of President Trump to limit the entry into the United States of potential terrorists from Islamic majority countries. ""President Biden and the people he has appointed to key positions in his administration have pursued the most radical border-opening policies in the history of any sovereign nation, and these new numbers bear it out,"" the Federation for Reform chairman said. immigration officer, Dan Stein, in a statement accompanying the report."
2610	5	The study says the states with the most illegal immigrants are California (3.3 million), Texas (2.2 million), Florida (1.2 million), and New York (1.1 million). The states with the fewest illegal immigrants are North Dakota and West Virginia, with 6,000 each.
26100	1	Milan invaded by the children of freeloading immigrants to maintain
26100	3	Milan cares about poverty. In fact, all welfare goes to immigrants. Not only illegal immigrants, but also working immigrants do underpaid jobs in which they replace Italians precisely because of their availability, and therefore their children must then be supported by the subsidies paid with the taxes of the Italians themselves who may be unemployed because of them.
26100	5	They are almost a thousand. At almost one hundred euros a day they make more than 30 million euros.
26100	7	"“In Milan we have about 950 unaccompanied foreign minors, and they will increase with the summer: very high numbers that make it difficult to give a quality response. Milan is an attraction, a national direction is needed for each local authority to do its part"". This, more than that of the at least eight thousand who arrived in the city from Ukraine, hosted ""90% by families who need to be guaranteed support"", is the urgent problem of ""reception, including education"" reported by the municipal councilor for Welfare Lamberto Bertolè . It is no coincidence that the Municipality froze 49 million in Welfare spending for two months in order to close the budget in the red: each minor immigrant costs twice as much as an adult. Huge numbers."
26100	9	"Providing answers to the ""social malaise"", underlines the Minister of Labor Andrea Orlando, ""is also a way of taking on the difficulties of democracy"". In Lombardy in January over 95,000 families received basic income, for a total of 188,000 beneficiaries; about 23 families and 42,000 people in Milan. “40-50% of RDC recipients in Italy have a work contract – clarifies the minister -. ""Poor work"" is even more dramatic where the cost of living is higher""."
26100	11	They import slaves and then complain about 'poor labour'. Morons.
26104	1	Masks and school: how can you not be indignant?
26104	3	"With the huge crowds in the recent concerts or celebrations in Milan and Rome, the persistence on the use of masks in the school clearly reveals that there is a clear message from the ""best"" towards the new generations. A way to punish and educate them as demonstrated by the famous photo of Draghi and Zaia, strictly without, surrounded by masked elementary school children."
26104	5	"A reflection is required if, as it is almost certain, the ""best"" have not even managed to remove the absurd obligation for the final exams!"
26104	7	No internationally accredited study, to date, has managed to establish a correlation between the obligation of masks in schools and their effectiveness in protecting against covid infections. Even the most recent Danish study was unable to find significant differences in the percentage of infected pupils between school districts with the obligation to wear masks and districts where children can attend without any supervision.
26104	9	"So why deprive our kids of oxygen and freedom of expression, sociality and movement? This was explained by the Undersecretary of Health, Andrea Costa, in a statement that did not arouse the necessary indignation and deserved outcry: ""I don't think the obligation to wear a mask at school is a purely scientific choice, but it is more a political interpretation"" ."
26104	11	Is it, therefore, a sort of educational experiment?
26104	13	"We have already had the opportunity to talk about the psychological bonus as a form of individual psychiatrization of a purely social discomfort, but we had not yet read the shameful, worrying conclusions that emerged from the Sinpia joint conference (Italian Society of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry) and Sinpf (Society of NeuroPsychopharmacology) entitled: ""Clinical psychopharmacology in developmental age: efficacy, safety and implications in later stages of life"" which was held yesterday in Cagliari."
26104	15	"The discomfort of children and adolescents turns into a ""lack of resilience"", which presents the prodromes of a future serious psychiatric pathology, if not treated in time with drugs."
26104	17	Here are some steps:
26104	19	The pandemic has not only increased the cases of psycho-emotional discomfort in young people but has also doubled the accesses of patients to specialized centers and hospitals – explains Alessandro Zuddas, SINPIA Vice-President and professor of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry at the University of Cagliari – . In the absence of adequate social or health support, from the teacher and other non-family reference adults (e.g. sports coach) and from the dramatic decrease in direct interaction with friends and classmates, they exploded into serious manifestations and with them also the drug prescription. In relation to the latter aspect, several critical issues have emerged: for example, the incongruous prescribing choices, oriented towards effective and safe antidepressants or antipsychotics in adults, much less in children and young people.
26104	21	Perhaps after this premise, child neuropsychiatry warns that social discomfort should NOT be treated with drugs? No, ours seems to disregard and abjure state law 180 of 1978, known as the Basaglia law.
26104	23	"In fact, he recommends other ad hoc medicines for children. ""Today, on the other hand, we also have an important therapeutic range for young people, which is certainly effective, as evidenced by literature data. Hence the need for (in)formation between the medical profession and the population, parents and children""."
26104	25	If left untreated, the symptoms persist into adulthood
26104	27	"Claudio Mencacci, Sinpf Co-President and emeritus director of Psychiatry at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, explains that ""the prevalence of these disorders tends to increase with the growth of the child to reach a peak in adolescence and drag on into adulthood. Yes however, he estimates that only half of these disorders are properly diagnosed and that of these only a fifth can be taken care of by Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry services.In addition to the lack of dedicated services, this is aggravated by the persistence of misinformation, taboos and social and cultural stigma that are difficult to break down, with important consequences for the child/adolescent; the frequent condition of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders contributes to complicating the clinical picture and the response to treatments"". And again: ""In short, if it is true that mental disorders in children and adolescents have increased with the pandemic, and that they often lead to acts of self-harm and suicide attempts, it is equally true that an important role is played by parents , who must not hesitate to ask for help but turn to a dedicated expert at the onset of an initial symptom or in the presence of developmental difficulties, to avoid the evolution towards a full-blown pathology."""
26104	29	In other words, down to earth: if you feel discomfort, suffering, fear, depression, from having lived 3 winters between distance learning and a mask at school, from no longer being able to play with your peers or celebrate a birthday, if you no longer have been able to reach school or go to the cinema without a pass, if you have no longer been able to see your grandparents because you are a possible spreader, if you are also undergoing a family and social climate of stress, hypochondria or apartheid, if your family is facing the dramatic psychological and socio-economic consequences of pandemic management and now looks with dread at the future of a war economy....
26104	30	"then you are potentially a psychiatrically ill adult and it is better not to waste time, you need to stuff yourself with psychotropic drugs ""suitable for your age""..."
26104	32	We are approaching more and more quickly and unconsciously the US social model, where a lively child is treated with a diagnosis of hyperactivity, where whoever fails with respect to the goal of success is guilty, maladapted, cannot be homogenized, to be marginalized, a dangerous symptom of a way of feel non-compliant.
26104	34	And today we get the news from the USA of a 10-year-old boy, arrested in handcuffs and pilloried by a video shot and circulated online by the police themselves.
26104	36	"The boy had sent text messages to the school threatening to carry out a massacre. As Skytg24 reports today, ""the threat follows the massacre at the Uvalde elementary school in Texas, where an eighteen-year-old opened fire and killed 21 people. It was the sheriff himself who published the video of the arrest of the child. In the video, an officer is seen carrying the handcuffed child inside the police car. ""This student's behavior is disgusting, especially after the recent tragedy in Uvalde, Texas. ""Making sure our children are safe is paramount. We will have law and order in our schools! My team didn't hesitate for a second,"" Marceno wrote on Facebook."
26104	38	"But is it so difficult to ask the doubt that the real culprit is precisely this social model, which would also like to set an example to the world, or does one run into the ""novax-Putin"" stigma?"
26107	1	99% did not want the Green Pass to be extended, and in fact they did. Democracy in Europe
26107	3	As you know, given that we have dedicated several articles to the subject, on a proposal from the European Commission, the European Parliament voted yesterday, as planned, to renew the EU Digital Covid certificate for another year. The vote was 453 in favour, 119 against and 19 abstentions.
26107	5	"The certificate regulation was scheduled to expire on 30 June. Earlier this month, a delegation from Parliament had already reached a ""political agreement"" with the Commission on the renewal of the certificate, thus making yesterday's vote practically a foregone conclusion. The funny thing, and which shows how much the EU cares about people's opinions, is that the Commission had held a public consultation whose results were extremely negative. The consultation gathered over 385,000 responses, almost all against the renewal!"
26107	7	In a letter to the European Ombudsman that French MEP Virginie Joron posted on her Twitter profile, Joron writes:
26107	9	I read hundreds of random responses with my team. I have not found any in favor of extending the QR code [i.e. the digital certificate]. Based on this large survey, it seems obvious that virtually all responses were negative.
26107	11	The negative trend of responses was evident from the outset. The full first page of responses, all dating back to February 4, can be found here. They are, of course, in the different languages ​​of the European Union: French, German, Italian and even one in English.
26107	13	To give readers an idea of ​​the tenor, here is a translation of a line or two of the first responses (starting at the bottom of the page):
26107	15	I am completely against the creation of this certificate given what is currently happening with the disastrous handling of Covid by the EU…
26107	17	I want this cst [probably a reference to Belgium's 'Covid Safe Ticket'] or vaccination passport simply deleted…
26107	19	There are scientifically unsupported claims in the draft document. For example, the Covid certificate is claimed to be effective protection against the spread of the virus – what data can support this claim?…
26107	21	Hi, I am shocked and disgusted by the freedom killing decisions taken in the EU…regarding this “European certificate”…..
26107	23	I never want to be subjected to a discriminatory certificate again…
26107	25	And so on through 385,191 replies, almost all negative.
26107	27	Naturally, since the responses were almost all negative and against, the Commission decided the opposite: it reached an agreement to continue it. Because, in the end, the Commission doesn't care what Europeans think. The important thing is only his agenda.
26108	1	Netherlands: 30,000 farmers on tractor rides to protest against the government's environmental policies
26108	3	The imposition of environmental policies by the minority Rutte government, remotely controlled from Brussels, is creating deep protests in the country, because it risks wiping out a substantial part of its agricultural economy. This has brought 30,000 farmers with tractors onto the highways. Here are some videos, which were obviously ignored in Italy of the impressive gathering.
26108	5	The protest derives from the imposition of an absurd regulation by the government against the emission of greenhouse gases, in this case based on nitrogen and ammonia, compounds that derive essentially from animal breeding. The government's goal is to reduce the animals raised by 30%, but this would obviously lead to the closure of a large number of farms, some of which are centuries old. All this will be sacrificed in the name of the ideology of the new European USSR and its centralized planning.
26108	7	The Netherlands are traditional exporters of meat to the rest of Europe, so there will also be a very heavy impact on the prices of these food products in other countries. The Rutte government is well aware that there will be very heavy repercussions on these companies, but in any case it has stated that... it doesn't care about anything, that companies must change and that the legislation will still be implemented. What will these sacrificed farmers do on the altar of climate change? They will stick to the tram, or they will move on to even stronger forms of protest.
26108	9	Obviously you will never hear anything about these fallout from the Commission's environmental policies in Italy, where they only invite extreme environmentalists who don't make a living from their work on TV.
2611	1	Washington is ready to wage wars of sanctions down to the last European
2611	3	Even the closest allies of the United States are starting to kick their butts as they try to avoid the fate of those who will be sacrificed in the sanctions wars with Russia.
2611	4	"This situation is already causing particular anger both in Washington and in London, where they are strongly and determinedly proposing to ""punish"" those countries that are not actively ""fighting"" against Russia."
2611	5	British economists are calling on Germany to immediately impose an embargo on Russian hydrocarbons. They define their purchases of Russian gas and oil as financing of the Russian military.
2611	6	In case of refusal, Berlin is threatened by the imposition of sanctions by Washington, London and Brussels. And never mind that the sanctions have already led to a rise in manufacturing inflation to 31% – and the oil and gas embargo could bury the German economy.
2611	7	Similar threats are also being sent to Hungary, which has also been barred from receiving financial assistance from Brussels, and threaten consequences for maintaining neutrality in Ukraine.
2611	8	In London, they are already ready to say that buying German goods is like supporting Russia, since they were produced with the help of Russian energy carriers. If so, then it's time to limit their access to the US and UK markets.
2611	9	Similar reports have already been made in Washington regarding Israel, its closest ally. The “hawks” in Congress, usually pro-Israel, turned the tables in the conditions of the Ukrainian crisis and began to threaten Jerusalem with the imposition of sanctions and the freezing of US military aid in the amount of three billion dollars per year. The reason is Israel's refusal to join Western sanctions.
2611	10	India, which remains neutral and buys oil from Russia, is no less under pressure. The United States suddenly began accusing her of human rights violations. Soon we can expect threats of sanctions, which have already been applied against India in the past due to allegations of discrimination against Muslims.
2611	11	As the consequences of the sanctions wars affect the economy, the desire to participate in them is declining rapidly. In Britain, the share of supporters of the sanctions also dropped from 50% to 36% in one month. And the more persistent will be the pressure of America, which acts according to the well-known logic: you die today in the war with Russia, and I will die tomorrow. If necessary, Washington is ready to unleash wars of sanctions to the last European.
26112	1	“The Great Game” II: British activity in Ukraine
26112	3	Geopolitics is a game on a fixed board in which not only the main players change, but also the colors of the pieces, and the rules themselves are fluid. Even if the basic mechanics remain unchanged and some storylines return years or even centuries later to remind us that the game of thrones (Game of Thrones) invariably takes place before our eyes, usually too distracted to notice its contours. Again British agents appear in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to persuade the natives to declare war on Russia so that Britain regains its dominant position, first in Europe and eventually also in the Middle East. The Great Game continues.
26112	5	Role distribution
26112	6	Only people who fail to recognize the changes in international politics can still think that the Ukrainian game is played by (only) Russia and the United States. For nothing. Of course, the American hegemon still maintains overall control over all geopolitics of the Western Hemisphere, but its suffocating economy forces a division of labour. The reality is that if the United States does not focus on the China issue, it will not only lose its (already shattered) record as the world's largest economy, but will also be dethroned as the most important center of global capital, which already sees itself as undergoing change from the supported side.
26112	8	If Wall Street once (partially) replaced the City, today the possibility of shifting the main weight of global finance to Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing remains on the table. Since China is already the world's leading industrial center, the concentration of elements of capital's big decisions could rescue the consumerist form of capitalism known as Fordism, which has been dominant since the end of World War II. And all this while America and the UK are already enacting a major transformation of capitalism under the guise of COVID-19 and the climate crisis. Americans must turn to address these challenges, to focus on the Far East and the Pacific, or else they can get a near-fatal kick in their… rear.
26112	10	The empire strikes again
26112	11	However, Washington did not dominate and paralyze Europe for so many decades as to leave it today without the enlightened leadership of the Anglo-Saxons. History and geopolitics have come full circle, as we witness a bizarre, but thoroughly serious, attempt to rebuild the British Empire. It is not the Americans, but the British who are Russia's main opponents in Ukraine. In effect, Westminster took full control of the foreign policy (including energy security) of Poland and the Baltic states. The British presence is more than visible on the historical battlefield of the Great Game, i.e. in Central Asia. Each week brings new evidence of Britain's growing involvement in the conflict with Russia.
26112	12	Another visit by Boris Johnson to Kiev (immediately after the European summits) is recognized in the United Kingdom as a proposal that cannot be rejected by Volodymyr Zelensky: that the Ukrainians not even think of any other scenario than joining the organized bloc under the leadership with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (and probably Moldova and Romania). The second tier of the same plan would be UkroPolin, a hybrid Polish-Ukrainian state, promoted in Polish and Ukrainian politics, especially by politicians overtly controlled by the British embassy. And of course the last act of the operation would probably be to launch this whole alliance against Russia.
26112	14	New colonies of the old empire
26112	15	England is increasing its assets in Ukraine. As Kiev prepared to attack Russia, the British trained at least 22,000 Ukrainian soldiers (Operation Orbital). Now Prime Minister B. Johnson has promised to train 10,000 more, probably in Poland. Since February, Westminster has transferred £1.3bn to Kiev, supplied thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles, rocket launchers and artillery systems, including NATO's M109. The silly final of the Eurovision Song Contest, which will be hosted by Ukraine next year, will also be staged in… United Kingdom. Indeed, perhaps Ukraine will emerge with Poland in UkroPolin, but only to turn them into British colonies.
26112	17	War propaganda in the UK is perhaps not as primitive as in Poland or Lithuania, but nearly as intense, although at least there are some independent voices tolerated even by the left (George Galloway's British Workers' Party, Chris Williamson Movement), who from the right (popular conservative writer and blogger Peter Hitchens). Censorship, however, reaches universities and the mainstream media eagerly pursues any public criticism of the resurgence of imperialism.
26112	19	Russo-British War?
26112	20	However, the pro-Kiev tide in the UK seems to be ebbing and ordinary English and Scottish families are questioning the delays in paying the so-called “thanks” for welcoming Ukrainian immigrants into their homes (many English and Scottish families are still waiting for the 350 pledged pounds per month). It hardly matters, because “Europe's oldest (liberal) democracy” is no longer democratic, nor pro-free speech, and the political and financial establishment almost bluntly state that the UK is itself at war with the Russia.
26112	22	"The Great Game is back. Today it is played not only in diplomacy, on battlefields and in secret service combat, but also in a virtual dimension. The techniques vary, but the domain is always in order. Only one empire can survive and, when it cannot, it prefers to divide itself to prevent the end of Anglo-Saxon hegemony. As Sir William Harcourt once told the young Winston Churchill: ""Nothing ever happens..."""
26116	1	"Bonino: ""Italy must import 400,000 immigrants a year to replace Italians"""
26116	3	Bonino and Calenda should be arrested for high treason. Those who propose ethnic subversion through immigration - which is genocide by other means - should have no place in civilian life.
26116	5	Integrate more immigrants to save the Italian demographic balance. Italy is an overpopulated country. Japan, with zero immigration, has no security and welfare problems.
26116	7	If one really wanted to 'save the demographic balance' with immigration, only temporary workers should enter who would then be replaced on a rotational basis every five years by younger workers. Instead we host 2.5 million non-working immigrants: children, wives, parents and various parasites. Ergo: they are a cost, not a balance.
26116	9	So Italy does not need more immigrants. If anything, to get rid of 2.5 million economic and social parasites. And replace the other 2.5 million with unemployed Italians and the descendants of Italians in South America.
26116	11	Bonino, for years with the Radicals financed by Soros, was one of the architects of the demographic vacuum that she is now denouncing.
26116	13	Thanks to her and to those like her, we are missing a few million Italians. Who now she and those like her want to replace with Africans with an IQ that would slide us into a future depicted well in the film Idiocracy. Obviously she was wrong before and wrong now. Otherwise we wouldn't have 30% of unemployed young people. The reality is that, despite the demographic vacuum, we still have 'too many' young people.
26116	15	We need a Nuremberg, not a Draghi government.
26118	1	Orsini attacks Draghi: “That cheating in the meeting with Zelensky”
26118	3	"Professor Alessandro Orsini, professor of Sociology of international terrorism has no doubts: ""Draghi is cheating the Italians in agreement with Biden""."
26118	5	"A concept that the professor, accused of being pro-Putin and practically at the top of the various ""proscription lists"" that have appeared in recent months on some media containing intellectuals and journalists considered friends of Moscow, reiterated last night in the episode of It's not The Arena conducted by Massimo Giletti on La7."
26118	7	"Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Professor Orsini has denounced what he believes to be the false narrative of the West about the real reasons for the war, demonstrating how it was in reality the United States and NATO that for years provoked Russia and cause his reaction to Ukraine. He was not the only one to say it, but despite this he has become the symbol of the Italian intellectual to be detested as capable of defending what the West has now identified as the ""new Hitler"". It has been attacked left and right, with lots of parliamentarians running to ask for it to be blacked out from television channels, starting with those of the public service, on the pretext that Rai is paid with Italian money even if certain pseudo-liberal politicians they always remember when it suits them."
26118	9	"Orsini, however, did not let himself be intimidated and continued his crusade, denouncing the faults of the West and dismantling what he defines as the fake narrative on the Ukrainian conflict concocted by the mainstream system. According to him, in fact, there would be ""a clear gap between what we hear and what really happens"" and this because there would be centers of power that would manipulate Western information. And last night from Giletti he went on the attack on Prime Minister Draghi."
26118	11	"Here are his words: ""Mario Draghi cheated the Italians"". Because? How?: “I would like the Prime Minister to put himself in the shoes of the Italians – explained Orsini – in Italy, on the other hand, there is a very clear chain of command, with Biden who makes the decisions, then there is Stoltenberg and then Draghi ”."
26118	13	"And he points out one detail: ""Every time Zelensky meets a florist he asks him for weapons, especially heavy ones, but we don't talk about it with the heads of state"". The reference is to the meeting that Draghi had with the Ukrainian president together with Olaf Scholz, chancellor of Germany, and Emmanuel Macron, president of the French Republic."
26118	15	"""On that occasion, the president of Ukraine did not ask for weapons - added Orsini - and he did not do so because they agreed"". And here lies, according to the professor, the ""cheating"" of Draghi who would have called Zelensky asking him not to make the request for other weapons, in consideration of the problems that the argument raises in the parliamentary majority that supports the Italian government (it is from yesterday the clash between the Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio and the M5S who would even like to distrust him). At least until the next parliamentary passage when, as has always happened, the premier will try to make the parties that support him swallow the soup."
26118	17	"Orsini finally explained that Draghi's is only a tactic to stall for time and overcome any crisis in Parliament: “What must Draghi do to do the perfect scam? He must deprive Parliament, override it ”he attacks again, to then continue:“ In other words – he added – he must put himself in the perfect condition to genuflect to Biden. And to do this he must make sure that Parliament does not say anything about the conduct of the war in Ukraine ”. The prime minister's goal in the end, according to the teacher, would be only to ""cheat the Italians and find a way to send heavy weapons whenever the US requests it""."
26118	19	"Heavy accusations that would demonstrate the degree of Italy's submission to the United States. And that would primarily penalize Italian economic interests. Because, as Orsini always explains, ""the longer the war goes on, the more problems there will be for the Italian economy""."
26118	21	"One thing is certain, Orsini does not seem at all intimidated by the attacks he has received, nor by being included in the lists of Putin's friends. He then issued a challenge to Giletti: ""Take a pen and paper, let's calculate the international policy experts who in Italy speak well of the government saying that Draghi does nothing wrong and of those who do the opposite"" also denouncing the consequences and intimidation which those like him who think differently would be subjected. But this is certainly nothing new, given that since the time of the war in Iraq the life of correspondents who strayed from the official narrative has always been hard. The real news is that there are those who resist, despite everything."
26119	1	St. Petersburg sets the stage for the War of the Economic Corridors
26119	3	"In St. Petersburg, the new world powers have gathered to overturn the ""rules-based order"" devised by the United States and reconnect the globe in their own way"
26119	5	The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum has for years now emerged as absolutely essential for understanding the evolving dynamics and trials and tribulations of Eurasia integration.
26119	7	St. Petersburg in 2022 is even more crucial as it directly connects to three simultaneous developments that I had previously outlined, in no particular order:
26119	9	"First, the arrival of the ""new G8"" - four BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), plus Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico, whose GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP) is already pale the old, Western-dominated G8."
26119	11	"Secondly, China's ""Three Rings"" strategy for developing geo-economic relations with its neighbors and partners."
26119	13	"Third, the development of BRICS+, or extended BRICS, including some members of the ""new G8"", to be discussed at the next summit in China."
26119	15	There was no doubt that President Putin would be the star of St. Petersburg 2022, delivering a trenchant and detailed speech at the plenary session.
26119	17	"Among the highlights, Putin destroyed the illusions of the so-called ""golden billion"" living in the industrialized West (only 12 percent of the world's population) and the ""irresponsible macroeconomic policies of the G7 countries""."
26119	19	"The Russian president noted how ""EU losses due to sanctions against Russia"" could exceed $400 billion a year and that high energy prices in Europe - something that actually started ""in the third quarter last year"" - are due to ""blindly believing in renewable energies""."
26119	21	He also dutifully rejected Western propaganda of “Putin's price hike,” saying the food and energy crisis is linked to misguided Western economic policies, eg, “Russian grain and fertilizers are sanctioned” to the detriment of the West.
26119	23	Simply put: the West misjudged Russia's sovereignty when it sanctioned it, and now it's paying a very high price.
26119	25	"Chinese President Xi Jinping, addressing the forum via video, sent a message to the entire South of the world. He evoked ""true multilateralism"", insisting that emerging markets must have a ""voice in global economic management"" and called for ""improved North-South and South-South dialogue""."
26119	27	It was up to Kazakh President Tokayev, Russia's and China's deeply strategic partner, to personally deliver the punchline: Eurasia integration should progress hand in hand with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Here it is, the circle closed.
26122	1	NATO promises to defend Melilla from assaults but not Lampedusa
26122	3	Yet an attack has been underway against the Italian coasts for decades from all sides. One also from a NATO 'ally', Turkey.
26122	5	The boats arriving in Almeria testify to Algiers' intention not to control immigration, in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Spain.
26122	7	Algeria yesterday sent Spain a new warning of its 'disappointment' over political issues, confirming the threat not to control the clandestine sea route. The arrival of several small boats off the coast of Almeria showed Algeria's permissiveness, as expected by the state security forces when the Spanish government decided to renew diplomatic ties with Morocco last March and changed the its location in the Sahara.
26122	9	To please one supplier of illegal immigrants, they dissatisfied another. It happens when you just ask that others do what you should do.
26122	11	"Yesterday's migratory episode in Almería - ""which will not be the last"", according to Guardia Civil sources consulted by this newspaper - took place in parallel with the closing of the NATO summit, whose agenda included the protection of Ceuta's borders and Melilla, after the armed assault of the previous days."
26122	13	Nothing about Lampedusa.
26122	15	What is the use of an alliance that 'defends' us from an imaginary danger, Russian tourists, and not from the Afro-Islamic invasion? The only threat to the future is Afro-Islamic immigration. This one must be fought, not Vlad.
26126	1	Great reset: in the end we will be the ones to ask him for the lockdown
26126	3	The Italian information lies knowing that it is lying, telling us the story of a Russia that would lose the war militarily and economically, to hide the catastrophe of a strategy that is bringing the most fragile peoples in the West to their knees, ours among the first, part of a front led by an elderly gentleman with little lucidity and remote control, literally placed at the head of the most powerful and at the same time decadent country in the world.
26126	5	It's all a lie: about the beginning and origins of the conflict, about who is exacerbating and prolonging it, who is losing and winning it. Even on the values ​​that we Westerners would represent: as if the stories of Julian Assange or Shireen Abu Akleh could be erased with dull and banal words.
26126	7	However, what is once again enormously striking is the ability of an obscure (not so much) direction to take advantage of emergency parentheses to continue its class struggle from top to bottom, stealing from the poor to give to the rich, overall redesigning the society in the image and likeness of its squalid partisan interests.
26126	9	While Draghi meets the top management of Uber and completely ignores the protests of fellow taxi drivers in the main squares of the country, we are preparing to snatch the Italian beaches away from small and medium-sized businesses to entrust them to large foreign multinationals. And Alessandro Somma says well on this point, in the Byoblu special signed by Gianuario, when he underlines how such measures would have been unthinkable if they had had the same impact on countries such as France or Germany: in fact, net of the need to possibly review the conditions of the concessions , the change of model will mean chopping up and throwing away a century of Italian tradition, history and customs. What's wrong, the usual servants of narration with unified networks ask almost dumbfounded, in wanting to entrust this sector to free competition too? There is a lot of bad: first for the crucial nature of the sector in the culture of our country, second because it would compare our small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who in many cases built those structures with the bitter sacrifice of several generations, with large international multinationals.
26126	11	I'm waiting for an Amazon-beach that knocks out Luca, the manager of the establishment where I go to the beach every summer: simply unacceptable.
26126	13	And in the meantime the cost of living explodes: with fifty euros you go to the supermarket and you barely pay for the air conditioning to keep the place cool for half an hour, assuming you don't get to ration that too. Then there is talk of energy rationing, due to the sanctions that we are allegedly imposing on Russia (it may seem like a paradox, but on TV we are taught that freedom comes at a price, it is a privilege), and finally of water rationing, cause of the drought that devours us. We will very plausibly soon have the rationing of CO2 emissions, for the next environmentalist emergency parenthesis.
26126	15	All potential forms of social control because someone will have to govern these rationings and nothing new under the sun or particularly shocking: after all we have even been accustomed by now to the rationing of civil rights, as it declined during the health crisis for years ... and yes it is rumored that in the autumn we will start again like this. Precisely.
26126	17	And think about it for a moment, taking the average male and female worker as an example: afflicted by high unsustainable prices, with stagnant wages because the EU, the ECB and the Bank of Italy ask us for it (while the unions are silent, accomplices and guilty!), with diesel skyrocketing, with you having to travel at least fifty kilometers a day to get to and from work, what could be more providential and redemptive than a good lockdown in autumn? We would certainly find someone happy to oblige us, anxiously waiting for that moment.
26128	1	Depopulation through vaccines
26128	3	After Germany where in the first three months of this year births fell by about 13 per cent, immediately suggesting a role of vaccines which have now known consequences on both the female reproductive system with the well-known menstrual disorders and male with a reduction in the number and motility of sperm. There is also a sudden and inexplicable drop in the birth rate in other European countries such as Austria and Switzerland even if for others the statistics are slow in coming, but now there is the sensational case of Taiwan where the birth rate fell by 23.24% in May 2022, compared to May 2021.
26128	5	Just like in Germany, also in Taiwan, as can be seen from the table, the birth rate remained constant for many years and then literally collapsed in 2022, a certain number of months after the blanket vaccination campaigns. The numbers on the island are important because they are so high that they cannot be passed off as causal oscillations even if as extreme as the advocates of vaccines to desperation might lead you to believe: statistical mathematics does not allow it.
26128	7	In fact, having no possible justifications from this point of view, an attempt is being made to put together an operation of the long Covid type, i.e. charging the disease for what is a consequence of vaccines. But in this case it is not so easy to cheat people because, at least in Europe, as in most of the world, the phenomenon should have already occurred in the first months of 2011 if the effect of the drop in the birth rate was due to the infection from coronavirus. But in Taiwan this is even more impossible to sustain, because the island has practically had no covid in 2020 and 2021, but the disease has practically spread with vaccines, i.e. it exploded starting from mid-April when the 91 for one hundred of the population was already vaccinated thanks to the incessant inoculation campaigns of 2021.
26128	9	"Even the least of the idiots would understand that covid cannot be the cause of a drop in the birth rate in the spring of this year, given that apparently from the latest ongoing research by television virologists it seems that pregnancy lasts approximately 9 months, but they try all the same, convinced that after all, more than believing in this nonsense, people are very afraid of disobeying and above all of showing themselves disobedient. After all, even science has been indelibly stained with infamy and to realize this, it is enough to read, among other things, this fact check of December 5, 2020 published by Reuters which states that the vaccine is certainly safe for pregnancy ""because there are no evidence that it is not safe”. In fact we know that no study was done, specific to pregnancy and fertility, we were simply told it was safe without knowing it."
26128	11	Indeed perhaps not: at this point some independent observers are beginning to believe that the vaccination of the youngest part of the population, that of childbearing age, although completely useless given the minimal effects of the covid on it, was planned specifically to obtain precisely the purpose of a drop in births which, moreover, was one of the proclaimed objectives of the vaccine prophet Bill Gates and of all the elite part that recognizes itself in these cheap dystopias, from a novel on the newsstand which is after all the gist of the thoughts of a very rich class, but lacking in culture and intelligence.
26128	13	Obviously the vast majority of people who participated in the vaccination campaigns could not have imagined such a sinister purpose, assuming that there was one and this will be seen from the duration of the conditions of difficult fertility due to gene serums. But I will tell you, maybe two years ago I would have been perplexed by these theses, but after 24 months of absurdity and lies, then exposed that one would never have expected to have to endure, after the Fed's attempt to hide the documentation on the approval of the Pfizer vaccine and then to release the documents in installments so as to take 75 years before arriving at the truth, after the discovery of the fakes and manipulations in clinical trials nothing can really be excluded. Except of course honesty and good faith
2613	1	China prepares for war
2613	3	Public opinion at the moment focuses its attention on the war in Ukraine, which rightly concerns the European continent. But what is happening in Asia has arguably much higher risk potential.
2613	5	China is quietly preparing for a mega Asian conflict without precedent in the history of humanity.
2613	6	From a satellite photo, as revealed the day before yesterday by the online news outlet Insideover, it emerged that the People's Republic of China has built a new long-range early warning radar. The image was taken in February by commercial satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies and shows that the new Large Phased Array Radar, or LPAR, was built on top of a mountain in the Yiyuan area of ​​Shandong province, about 110 kilometers southeast of Jinan city. The new radar can give China an early warning system for ballistic missile launches from North Korea, South Korea, most of Japan and even some sectors of the Russian Far East. This may give the reader insight into the scale of conflicts China plans to face on the Asian continent
2613	7	But that is not all.
2613	9	Some time ago the news was announced that the People's Republic of China and the Solomon Islands are about to conclude a defense agreement, which will allow the Chinese Navy to have a real military base in this country. In itself there would be nothing special, were it not for the fact that the Solomon Islands are located opposite Australia, albeit at a distance of 2000 kilometres.
2613	10	"The Australian media and political exponents of the island-continent have reacted vehemently: the Chinese base in the Solomon Islands is a ""red line"" and Australia will never tolerate the presence of the Chinese. These statements were echoed by the White House: ""the United States will act accordingly if China installs a military base in the Solomon Islands, in the Pacific""."
2613	12	In this regard, it should be considered that the USA, Great Britain and Australia signed an anti-China pact called Aukus a few months ago. It is clear that China, through the installation of a military-naval base in the Pacific Ocean, is preparing for a conflict also against the three countries of the Aukus pact.
2613	13	What is more surprising is that China says it does not want a third world war and supports the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy, as Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Wang Wenbin said a couple of days ago, quoted by the Tass Russian agency. In light of China's preparations for a future Asian war, the Chinese spokesman's statement sounds mocking. China does not want a third world war, but if it were forced to…
26131	1	Ukraine admits: Russia is winning, we retreat
26131	3	“After the heavy battles for Lysychansk, the Defense Forces of Ukraine were forced to leave their occupied positions and borders.” This was announced, twenty-four hours late with a pathetic post on Facebook by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in relation to the city, conquered yesterday by Russian troops.
26131	5	“Faced with the multiple advantages of Russian troops in terms of artillery, aviation, rocket launchers, ammunition and personnel – is the explanation of the surrender of Lysychansk – continuing the defense of the city would have led to fatal consequences. In order to preserve the lives of the Ukrainian defenders, the decision was therefore made to withdraw.” “Now we continue our fight. Unfortunately, an iron will and patriotism are not enough to win, material and technical resources are needed”, concludes the post, promising: “We will return and we will absolutely win”.
26131	7	Of course, you will come back.
26131	9	"The risk of the entire Luhansk region falling under Russian control ""exists, that's clear"", admitted the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, answering questions from journalists. Meanwhile, the entire region was already in de facto Russian hands."
26131	11	"In the Luhansk region there is ""the most complicated and dangerous situation. And there, it is true, we are not ahead"", says the president, pointing out that however in other areas of the country ""we are making progress"". Furthermore, ""the delivery of arms will increase our advantage and we will be able to push harder in this direction too (that of Luhansk, ed.)."""
26131	13	You are only ahead on social media. In the real world it is a catastrophe.
26134	1	"The German Greens' anti-Putin dilemma: ""How many minutes can a shower last?"""
26134	3	"But does Merkel wash the famous ""big ass""? It is not a provocation and it is not a far-fetched question, the former chancellor being the main responsible (the reasons have often been eviscerated, in this area and in the sister area of ​​the Atlantic) for the energy crisis gripping Europe. And now Germany is equipping itself in the German way: the state claims to decide the frequency and duration of showers, so as to save gas and water in one fell swoop."
26134	5	The new environmental catechism
26134	7	A rich debate is flourishing: on the one hand the liberals, a few, reduced to an Indian reservation, scandalized by yet another Hegelian meddling, on the other the progressives, too many, implacable, who demand: more state, more controls, less hygiene. For example, listen to the Minister of Economy, who is a Green, an environmentalist, as to say that lurid politics is not just our thing: Robert Kabeck doesn't want to impose anything on anyone, he claims, but unfortunately the alternative is the German one: either you actually give up the shower, or you take another one, based on Zyklon B.
26134	9	"It is useless to argue: neo-communism has already won, neo but always not very clean, in Holland they have decided to reduce the time ""allowed"" under the jet from 10 to 5 minutes: stuff that makes you shiver, but Kabeck laughs like a kapò: ""5 minutes ? Too many, I've never used so many, I'm fast”. And since this is done in Pratesi, everyone is required to follow it. Obviously the media, starting with the Italian ones, are deployed in the usual immodest way, something like the perpetual dose of vaccine that hurts more, especially for children, and makes it more inevitable. Reading the veins of the regime is believing."
26134	11	Of course, thirty years of the European Union have done us great good: we have regressed to African tribal levels, with which, perhaps, many migrants will go back given that once they land they find the same opportunities as at home. But who would have thought it: from the summary care of the body, daughter of the war, to the consumerist explosion of cosmetics, foams, essences, up to the return of filth in the Marxist-Leninist-Brigatist mold. How will all those useless influencers do? Will they shoot unshaven poses with scabs in their highlights?
26134	13	Italy is a particular case, the German debate - false, hypocritical, but at least timidly proposed - here is skipped on the ball (and not washed). Chist is 'o Paese di Fulco, a man born rich who has found a way to stay in the world in fake ecological fancazzismo; 'o Paese di Alessandro Gassman, someone whose mission is to spy, report, and that one doesn't wear a mask, and this other one hasn't had his fiftieth dose, and that other one has washed, do you understand?

He sucks, and it's scary, but going back to daytime, dime for two minutes including rinsing, is no longer an option: it's a reality, and it doesn't allow for alternatives."

Imagine the scenes on the buses, on the means of transport: the usual ass face that, behind six masks one on top of the other, points like a beagle: sniff sniff, here you don't smell the stink: but you, excuse me, when did you wash the last time? This morning? But you are a criminal, do you want us all to die? Comptroller, sir doesn't taste like shit! And the inspector, what a stench of a Roman dumpster: I'm sorry, he has to get off, it's the law. And be ashamed.
26134	21	This bus is a gas chamber, this Europe is a dung heap and this West is fucked. From Berlin to Amsterdam, from Paris to Verona, where a remarkable case occurs: for years, for decades under the balcony of Romeo and Juliet the national shame, the cradle of neo-Nazis, a city to be sanitized, some partisan scribes of negligible value done an article a day, he too had to find a way to stay in the world; then they elect the union footballer Tommasi, one of those who earned millions but always with a clenched fist, and Verona suddenly becomes the democratic avant-garde, the national jewel. And what is Tommasi doing to you as the very first act? He rations water, forbids it, convinced in this way of saving the Veneto and the whole planet from desert drought.
26134	23	As populist idiocy, there is something to induce Greta to an unexpected orgasm. Verona dirigista, populist, statist and the showers, dear beggars who pay taxes to reduce you to bums, you can also dismantle them: next stop, a ticket to swim in the sea and you'll see if we don't get there.

26142	1	"The UN: ""New greenhouse gas record. We are off track"""
26142	3	"The World Meteorological Organization's annual bulletin records a higher annual rate of increase than the 2011-2020 average, and this trend has continued in 2021. ""At this rate, the temperature rise is well over 1.5-2°C"""
26142	5	A new record for greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was reached last year, with an annual rate of increase above the average for the period between 2011 and 2020, and this trend has continued in 2021. The alarm comes from the Organization World Meteorological Survey (WMO), a United Nations agency, in its annual report on heat-trapping greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide).
26142	7	"Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases put the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement at risk, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said, warning: ""We are really off track."""
26142	9	"""The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin - adds Taalas - contains a clear scientific message for the climate change negotiators at COP26. At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, by the end of this century we will see a rise in temperature by far above the Paris Agreement targets by 1.5 to 2°C above pre-industrial levels""."
26142	11	"The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere passed the 400 parts per million mark in 2015, recalls the WMO secretary general, noting that ""just five years later, it has exceeded 413 ppm. This is more than just chemical formulas and figures on a graph. It has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren,"" he added."
26142	13	"""Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer,"" Taalas explained. ""The last time Earth experienced a similar concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when temperature was 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then,"" Taalas said."
26142	15	"""Many countries - he continued - are now setting carbon neutral targets and it is hoped that COP26 will see a substantial increase in commitments. But we must transform our commitment into actions that will have an impact on the gases that cause climate change. We must review ours industrial, energy and transportation systems and the whole way of life. The necessary changes are economically accessible and technically possible. There is no time to waste,"" Taalas said finally."
26143	1	CLIMATE: GLOBAL WARMING will last a LONG time and the first victim could be MAN. A STUDY reveals it
26143	3	Although several states have implemented actions, thanks to the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming, there have been no significant improvements, particularly towards the reduction of CO2. A study carried out by a group of researchers from the McGill Universities of Quebec, Canada, Oxford, Leeds and New York, also reported by the newspaper Repubblica, hypothesized three future scenarios up to 2500. From what emerged, taking into consideration some places such as the American Midwest (the granary of the world), the Amazon forest (the lungs of our planet) and the Indian sub-continent (the most populated area on Earth), in the first scenario the monoculture of cereals could be replaced by subtropical plants such as pineapples , in the second the great forest could disappear and turn into a desert due to the lack of rains and, in the last one, in India the intense heat could make it difficult for man to work outdoors assuming the use of protective clothes or even of machines that completely replace the human being.
26143	5	These are apocalyptic scenarios for the three places taken into consideration by the experts. But more generally, across the globe, vegetation could change dramatically and agricultural production shrink. Sea levels would continue to rise due to the accumulation of heat in the ocean floor and many people would be forced to migrate north due to heat stress which would start to be felt starting from countries close to the equator.
26143	7	Scholars, therefore, are particularly alarmed, since it will be impossible to go back to the pre-industrial era. The solution would be to completely remove the polluting gases, but that is obviously impossible. For this reason, it is at least necessary to aim, as soon as possible, for a substantial cut in CO2, implementing innovative long-term actions.
26152	1	"Abrignani (Cts) on Covid: ""Vaccine obligation as long as the virus circulates, perhaps years"""
26152	3	"For the immunologist and member of the CTS, the obligation to vaccinate against Covid ""will make sense as long as the virus is circulating"""
26152	5	"In an interview with La Stampa, the immunologist Sergio Abrignani, a member of the Cts, explains that the obligation to get vaccinated against Covid19 ""will make sense as long as the virus circulates, and I have the impression that it will last for years. I would like to emphasize that it is not just about the individual, but about the whole community and the only way out of the pandemic. For example, there are 27 million people over 50, of whom almost 2 million are not vaccinated. The latter, 7%, represent 70% of those in intensive care. It's not just their problem, but that of hospitals and other sick people who can't find a place""."
26152	7	The immunologist says that obligations, such as the one for the over 50s regarding work, are useful. «In my opinion, yes, but these are political choices that I won't enter into. From a scientific point of view I can say that vaccination is a fundamental tool. Then I was for the obligation when it wasn't there, let alone now ».
26152	9	With regard to whether or not children are vaccinated, Abrignani explains that «the virus has not disappeared and the scientific societies of pediatrics strongly advise it. They are the same doctors who consult when children are sick, and now instead they are thought to be lying for a worldwide conspiracy. Surreal».
26152	11	The immunologist on the fourth dose
26152	13	"As for the fourth dose, Abrignani says that «a fourth dose with the same vaccine of the Wuhan strain, as tested in Israel, the data does not currently support its benefit. After all, with so many vaccinations in the past we have seen that three doses are enough, two doses 3-4 weeks apart and the third after 4-12 months, guaranteeing an immune memory of 5 to 10 years ». Eventually, according to the immunologist, they could benefit from a fourth recall «rare cases of immunosuppressed for genetic, pharmacological or infectious reasons, or dialysis patients. For them, it is hoped that the fourth dose will induce at least short-term protection"". For the rest of the population, Abrignani believes that ""the booster would be a new dose after the current three, but we do not yet know if, how and when it will be necessary""."
26152	15	Read also:—>Man shot dead in the street: carabinieri investigate
26152	17	"For the immunologist, three options could open up: «The first, unlikely, is that the virus disappears and at that point there would be no need for boosters. The second, less unlikely, but difficult, given Omicron's record infectivity, is that a new variant will force us to update vaccines. The third is that the current variant remains. In the latter case, a booster could be evaluated with a vaccine updated to Omicron which perhaps also prevents infection very effectively as well as the disease. Then there is the possibility, difficult for me, that the third dose will not last long and then a fourth would be necessary with the current vaccine""."
26152	19	"Read also:—>Canada-USA bridge reopened occupied by ""freedom convoy"" for 6 days"
26152	21	"The next choices will be made «by monitoring protection from the disease in the field. If it went down for some reason, it would be time for a recall. So far the third dose holds up, lasts at least 5 months although eventually it will probably be much longer. The important fact is the protection from the disease, because it is not known how much antibodies are related to immunity. Based on the experience with other vaccines, with firm variants"", immunity could be of ""several years, but I am ready to be proven wrong""."
26152	23	"As for the side effects of the vaccine, Abrignani underlines that these are «irrational fears. The only fact is that in young people there can be rare myocarditis that is not serious and can be cured in a few days with cortisone. All regulatory agencies say there is a greater risk of myocarditis from viruses than from vaccines. Out of billions of people vaccinated, of which hundreds of millions under the age of 30, no one died for this reason ». Finally, with regard to the new Novavax vaccine, the immunologist explains that it is ""more traditional, based on recombinant proteins"" and that ""perhaps it will be able to convince unjustifiably doubtful people like some parents who fear for their children. Scientifically it will be useful to compare the duration of its protection with that of mRna vaccines, even if I don't think there will be a difference."

26156	3	the opinion
26156	5	Berlusconi can go down in history paving the way for the best, Draghi
26156	7	The Cav. can be the real protagonist in the race to Colle. Not as future president but as kingmaker
26156	9	What do I think of Berlusconi at the Quirinale? Since what the Financial Times would be the first best, Sergio Mattarella as president until the end of the legislature, is not practicable due to unavailability of the interested party, but since the second best is available, Mario Draghi at the Quirinale for seven years, the answer is that it would be a wrong choice. One, not the choice: any other name would be wrong. A malicious question, a clear answer: in itself, in the abstract, I don't believe that Berlusconi cannot be president of the Republic, indeed I recognize the reasons why he could be. If, always in the abstract, he became one, I wouldn't return my passport to the Interior Ministry: and let your malice die!
26156	11	"I did three electoral campaigns, one with the Progressives, two with the Ulivo, I was in the Senate for three legislatures: always, Berlusconi was the opponent to beat. If I have sometimes voted differently from my group, it was because I thought it would be better fought that way. I have always thought that visceral anti-Berlusconism, ""with the helmet"", has brought ""serious losses to the Achaeans"". Many have criticized me, but I was not alone. My appeal published in Corriere on 4 December 1994, one of my first public statements as a new senator, denounced the ""short-sighted pact against future generations"" with which the union had forced the removal from the budget of a pension reform, albeit modest presented by the first Berlusconi government: in addition to the signatures of Franco Modigliani, Sylos Labini and Mario Baldassarri, I also collected that of Romano Prodi."
26156	13	"Andreatta and Prodi founded the centre-left, with or without a hyphen, Berlusconi the centre-right. Together they gave birth to the season of majority and alternation. Compared to the current political landscape, I don't think I'm the only one who regrets it, and if it weren't for this, the future president would have to make them both senators for life. With Prodi (and Draghi general director of the Treasury) Italy won the Oscar of privatizations, liberalizing and returning to the market industrial sectors monopolized by the state for more than half a century; but he didn't even try to privatize Rai. Berlusconi circumvented the monopoly with his commercial television and thus claiming to be the mother of all liberalisations: it gives Italians the freedom to choose and gives entrepreneurs a formidable instrument for promoting the country's internal growth. A first, very small step towards the boundless digital freedom. Instead, for anti-Berlusconism, commercial television created an ""intrinsically Berlusconian"" world: thus it led the left to positions incompatible with the claim to interpret the modern. It was a war of power disguised as a war of religion, it was our thirty years' war, as the title of the book I wrote with Antonio Pilati."
26156	15	"Berlusconi, copyright Mario Seminerio, ""was no worse than many of his opponents sick of moralism who, however, did not have his intuitions, and for this reason they were bitter about their own obvious inadequacy"". His opponents first tried to decree him incompatible by focusing on the conflict of interest; then, with a technicality, to make it incompatible; finally they discussed the way to declare him incandidabile. A quarter of a century later he may well run for the highest office in the state."
26156	17	The problem is not whether he can run, but whether it is convenient for him. To be one in great spite of many of his enemies is already a success, the more they contest him the more his value increases: with all due respect for the other names that are mentioned, his appears more and more to be the only candidate that can be opposed to that of Dragons.
26156	19	Is it worth the risk? Why not silence his detractors instead, and go down in history as the one who, despite having the numbers to try to win, gives them up to pave the way for what he too must in his heart recognize to be the best choice for the country. It was he who sent him to govern the Bank of Italy, he who launched him to the presidency of the European Central Bank, he will be able to say that it was he who paved the way for him at Colle. Those were two excellent choices: this one will be too. Once again: thank you Silvio.

26160	3	"The point of no return is approaching in the international economic scenarios of the war between Russia and Ukraine. This is yet another ""blow"" for Italy, one of the countries most dependent on the energy front from Russia. ""We need to prepare for more gas supply disruptions, even a complete cut from Russia."" This is the dramatic announcement made today by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in her speech in the plenary session of the European Parliament for the presentation of the Czech presidency of the EU."
26160	5	Today, a total of 12 Member States are directly affected by partial or total reductions in gas supply. It is obvious: Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. For this reason, the Commission is working on a European emergency plan. We will present this plan and the necessary tools by mid-July. Member States already have their own national emergency plans. This is good, but we need European coordination and joint action. We need to make sure that, in the event of a complete outage, the gas flows to where it is needed most. We must provide for European solidarity. And we need to protect the single market and industry supply chains, explained the president.
26160	7	We must never forget the bitter lesson we learned at the start of the pandemic. Selfishness and protectionism only lead to disunity and fragmentation. While European unity and coordination have been the key remedies to overcome this brutal pandemic. As always, we hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. This is hard work ahead of us. But as in recent weeks, unity will lead to success, he stressed. The economic consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine are becoming more and more serious. Between the economic recession, inflation and the pandemic, it will be a very tough winter for Italians.
26166	1	Beware of the French lesson. It can also teach Italy something
26166	3	"It would be simplistic and even comforting to brand the result of the French legislative elections as the revenge of populism. A formula that purges the traditional parties of any fault, as if they were saying: what can you do if people prefer ""those there"" who are unpresentable."
26166	5	On the other hand, it is more difficult to investigate the reasons why the voters who chose Emmanuel Macron as president less than two months ago now punish him by denying him the parliamentary majority. Not only that: they practically wipe out the traditional formations that had so far dominated the Fifth Republic by drawing an unprecedented picture. Probably useful to decrypt also for all western democracies, including Italy. Paris, as we know, has been the bearer of revolutions and changes for at least two centuries. Indicates wind direction.
26166	7	France cherishes its welfare and has always been at the forefront of defending rights, whatever they may be. Whether the socialists or the Gaullists governed, the champions of the dualism always invented in the Hexagon between left and right, no one dreamed of questioning some social achievements. So it was from de Gaulle, at the origins of the Fifth Republic, to Chirac. Passing through Giscard, Pompidou, obviously Mitterrand. The first break occurred with Nicolas Sarkozy, and it was 2007, with the casual ostentation of wealth by the tenant of the Elysée, the holidays on the yachts of finance nabobs, the idea spread by the top that if one was poor he had to feel guilty and ask himself questions because social climbing is within everyone's reach, you just need to work harder. Slogans questionable in themselves and destined to become rancid after less than a year with the great economic crisis of 2008 that started in the United States and swept Europe.
26166	9	"Kicked out after his first mandate by the president nicknamed ""bling-bling"" by the noise of the jewels, here comes the long-time socialist François Hollande at the Elysée, who presented himself during the electoral campaign with the resounding promise to tax incomes above 90 per cent million euros to aim for a more equitable redistribution of income in a society where inequalities were beginning to mark too deep a furrow between the wealthy and the rest of the citizens. Promise not kept. Indeed, it was precisely during his five-year term that Hollande favored the social democratic turn of a party which until then had jealously preserved its original roots on the left. To the point of creating a disorientation for which the programs of socialists and Gaullists became practically interchangeable, except for negligible nuances, in the name not only of marketism, but even of financial capitalism which seemed to be the only guiding star. And by invoking ""responsibility"" socialists and neo-Gaullists have tried to isolate the extreme wings both on the left and, above all, on the right. By delegating to them, naturally in a completely different way, the defense of the interests of the lower social classes which were increasingly growing as the crises progressed."
26166	11	Although suspected of being an expression of the elites for his curriculum as a first in the class and enfant prodige of investment banks, the first Macron was chosen for the conditioned reflex of stemming the unpresentable xenophobic and racist far right of Marine Le Pen. He reassured the French about his economic policy by pointing out that, although young, he was already sufficiently wealthy to be free from conditioning and in the ideal conditions to govern fairly in favor of all. Except that his first measure was to remove the tax on large fortunes in force since Mitterrand's time. Almost a provocation. Since then, an ostentatious look to the Républicains, the moderate right-wing party, for the formation of its governments. And a series of economic measures that certainly did not go to favor the working class (yes, it still exists in France) if they tended, for example, to precarious work (such as a reform on the Renzi model). Or programs in theory that can be shared on ecological transition but imposed from above and with unsustainable costs in a country exhausted by an unfavorable economic situation. It was rural France that was the first to rebel when it saw the cancellation of train stations, gendarmerie barracks and small community hospitals: the savings on public services, safety and health which were detrimental to the needs of a state which is not alone Paris even if we often tend to identify it with the capital.
26166	13	So after almost two decades of economic policy that has favored the wealthy classes, it is no wonder that voters have rebelled against yet another bill by the executive penalising, the one that raises the retirement age from 62 to 65 years: the most acceptable, if you will, but which represents the classic straw that breaks the camel's back. And they have preferred to choose those who instead promise to commit themselves to maintaining or even reducing the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and to try to reduce the gap between wealth and poverty.
26166	15	The French who get pissed, in the words of Paolo Conte, are the heirs of those who cut off the head of a king and do not disdain revolutions. Now they have sent a signal to the newly elected president, choosing Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the far left and Marine Le Pen on the far right because they have found no other parties in the political market with which they can identify. This is the moral that emerges from the French June. And he questions the political class in France as elsewhere. Because basically the trajectory of many Western democracies have followed the same parable so much that on several occasions we have wondered why there have not yet been social revolts in the face of such an evident assault on rights which had also been achieved with great effort while now it seems normal for a young man to work for 4 euros an hour (if it suits him).
26166	17	Beware of the French lesson. It can teach something to countries, such as Italy, now close to voting.

2617	3	The president of Nicaragua uses very clear words to comment on what is happening in Ukraine with the special military operation launched by Russia to demilitarize and denazify the Kiev regime. Russia is battling the Nazis in Ukraine, which has been in power since a brutal 2014 coup, reminiscent of attempts to overthrow popular governments in Nicaragua and Venezuela, Sandinista commander Daniel Ortega said.
2617	5	"War is shaking the world and we won't ignore it. Russia fights for its security against the Nazis who rule and kill in Ukraine after the 2014 coup d'état,” the president said during a Workers' Day celebration in Nicaragua.

2617	11	"They're from the same school - homicide, arson. They burned down the House of Trade Unions (in Odessa), where the workers opposed the Nazis, because they were against the coup. It is logical that they took refuge (in the building) with their stones and sticks. And what did the fascists do? They burned more than 40 workers alive, killed them, and all this - with the blessing, encouragement, collusion, resources of US and European imperialism,” Ortega denounced.
26172 1 The physicist Prodi against gretinism: But as CO2, global warming obeys natural cycles"""
26172	3	Rome, July 5 - Does global warming have an anthropic origin? Does this millennial theory based on Co2 scaremongering of which Greta Thunberg is the spokesperson have any vague scientific basis? Professor Franco Prodi, brother of the better known Roman and luminary in his field, is not so sure.
26172	5	"Physicist and academic specializing in meteorological studies and atmospheric physics, member of numerous national and international study commissions, he was director, until 2008, of the Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the CNR. For years he has argued that ""it is not possible, with current knowledge of the climate system, to quantify how much the anthropic effect is"", and that climate changes are cyclical, they have always existed, that there is such a multiplicity of data to consider and that, therefore, it is impossible to make certain long-term forecasts."
26172	7	Professor Prodi against stupid theories on global warming
26172	9	"Instead, we all remember how the illustrious brother and former Prime Minister had applauded the Swedish activist for having ""suddenly awakened an attention that no other media tool would have ever awakened"". His brother has a different opinion: in the aftermath of the tragedy of the Marmolada, which the Italian middle and political class hastened to attribute to global warming and the unsustainable lifestyle of the Italians, the luminary reiterated to La Verità some of his locations."
26172	11	Glacier retreat is cyclical
26172	13	"«There are natural causes and anthropic causes of the changes but the affirmations of the IPCC Reports - the UN committee that would like to study the anthropic contribution to the climate - are scientifically unfounded, theirs are only scenarios, not forecasts on which to base the fate of humanity"". No one here is denying that the planet's temperature is increasing: «We certainly live in a period of global warming and therefore it is clear that every warm period involves a phase of retreat of glaciers with phenomena, of the type that occurred recently. A few years ago I saw the remains of the collapse of one of the famous 5 Towers near the Falzarego». The retreat of the glaciers, however, is nothing new, and ""in the past the Alpine glaciers were even more withdrawn than today"" due to a ""cyclical trend"" that has now lasted for 10 thousand years. «The global warming we are experiencing is a natural fact and part of natural cycles. There is an anthropic component in climate change but it is not currently quantifiable with scientific seriousness""."
26172	15	But the powerful only listen to Thunberg
26172	17	"Casting doubts on the anthropic origin of global warming, Prodi points out, does not mean denying the existence of a pollution alarm ""on a global level, which must naturally be fought, even with binding international agreements: but CO2 is not a polluting gas"". In this regard, the physicist had signed a petition, «together with Italian scientists, taken up by a thousand scientists around the world, warning the political authorities against the supine acceptance of the IPCC recommendations and the consequent ""fight against global warming"". But by now this pseudo Word is so widespread that the requests of our representatives for talks with the political authorities are systematically ignored"". For Professor Prodi, «The hearing granted to Thunberg and denied to our petition says a lot about the discredit that science enjoys in our country. I sadly think - the scientist comments - that the point of no return has been reached»."
26176	1	Don't walk alone: ​​the surreal French handbook against the aggressions of immigrants
26176	3	Rome, July 9 - As the new crime statistics are published and Lyon settles in first place, becoming the most dangerous city in France (63 homicides in 2021 against 61 in Marseille and, as a comparison, 26 in Naples, against 18 in Rome and 19 in Turin), some city groups decide to create a handbook for use above all by women - but not only.
26176	5	Nantes, the handbook to avoid being raped by immigrants
26176	7	"First case in Nantes, the leaflet was proposed with the pleasant title Good behavior to go out in Nantes safely. As if to say, ""don't go looking for it""; a phrase that feminists have always - rightly - hated, but which now becomes obligatory just like the unsaid: that is, the pleonastic immigration-crime equation."
26176	9	But here is the happy formula for going out in complete safety in a normal European city:
26176	11	- Avoid taking out your phone
26176	13	- Choose a jacket with inside pockets and preferably with a zip closure
26176	15	- Pay attention to your glass to avoid being drugged by criminals
26176	17	- Stay on main roads and don't walk on small streets
26176	19	- Do not respond to offenses and insults or catcalling
26176	21	- Choose small bags that can be closed
26176	23	- Do not bring open bags
26176	25	- Don't go home alone
26176	27	- Do not take taxis or ubers alone
26176	29	- Do not take out the pack of cigarettes, do not smoke on the street
26176	31	- Don't stop in isolated places to look for something in your bag or reply to a text
26176	33	- Don't let your friends go home alone
26176	35	- Do not carry your phone in the back pocket of jeans or trousers
26176	37	- In the bus, stay close to the driver
26176	39	The only thing missing: don't wear a miniskirt or a too skimpy dress and wear make-up in moderation, and then the handbook contains more or less everything. Therefore, the moral is, instead of fighting crime, making our cities safe, limiting - or at least controlling - the phenomenon of non-European immigration so that a Western woman is free to go out how, where and when she wants, she is herself to have to protect themselves through «virtuous» behaviours.

26176	43	"The situation is so serious in France - and it will soon be in us too - that even one of the latest trends on TikTok is the use of the veil even for non-Muslims: ""the Christian veil and how to put it on in a stylish way"". Yeah, because if you're covered, you're probably a decent girl and less exposed to unwanted attention (and by unwanted attention we mean rape and assault). In fact, a sort of Islamization, a real transposition of Michel Houellebecq's visionary novel, Submission, which speaks of a France now conquered by Islam."
26177	1	"Here is the government's ""sweet"" plan: electricity and gas cuts. And a nice curfew. Tell us now that sanctions work"
26177	3	Rome, 11 July - Light and gas cuts, the government's sweet plan is ready, but the story won't change, they will continue to tell us that the sanctions against Russia work. They will parrot it in omnia media, like sad ventriloquists of the single verb, with the arrogance of sorcerers who know about it. With the most frightened they will resort to answers from Sapientino, because after all for those who live in panciolle we are facing a game for children, not a dramatic reality. And then they will tell us that the situation is all in all under control and that at most we should make some small sacrifices to prevent Putin from winning the war. Small sacrifices that translate into: less heating, less light, less consumption. In a nutshell: more frost and darkness, for a creepy winter.
26177	5	Light and gas cuts, like sugary candy
26177	7	"Read in this way it seems like an ominous prophecy from ominous birds, were it not that the Draghi government is really oriented towards implementing this amazing “emergency plan“. They already call it that, in a Pirandellian way it appears sweeter than a candy, bitter pills to be tasted like sugary beans. Everything will therefore be well dosed, in stages, one small sacrifice at a time. And only if Russia cuts our gas altogether huh. At the moment he has cut ""just"" a third of it."
26177	9	"The executive of the best is calmly preparing the plan, it has foreseen everything, even the ""awareness campaign"". They call it that, this too is an evergreen to sweeten the relentless propaganda aimed at persuading us of the goodness of drastic intervention. Needless to say, it will obviously be the Italian families who pay."
26177	11	The government's plan to leave you in the cold and in the dark
26177	13	"In the ""house plan"" it is assumed to lower the heating and air conditioning temperatures by two degrees. The reduction of the ignition time is also foreseen and also a nice curfew (ah, old sponge of a curfew) in this case not to avoid contagions from Covid. That is (perhaps) water under the bridge, we are facing a leap in quality (errata: leap in quantity) of the restrictions: the curfew in the evening will be for lighting. From micro to macro, from the ""housing plan"" we move on to the ""city plan"": reduction of public lighting up to 40%. In summary: turning on one lamp out of two at night. Even more radical measures have been announced: public offices closed early, at 5.30 pm, shop shutters lowered at 7 pm and a curfew for premises at 11 pm."
26177	15	"And again, one grain at a time, candy after candy, it will also be up to businesses to reduce production consumption. Selectively, it should be clear, only the so-called ""gas interruptibles"" and ""electricity interruptibles"" will initially be involved. Do they seem like terminological supercazzole for disturbing scenarios? But no, the sanctions against Russia work, it's just a matter of small sacrifices. And big chills."
26178	1	Widespread emergencies and the sloth of politics
26178	3	Covid has started running again and unfortunately, restrictive interventions and new measures are already being aired to be implemented in the autumn, with the return of the infamous mask and the advent of a fourth vaccination dose.
26178	5	The health emergency is tinged with new threats every day: monkeypox is only the latest in a worrying series of situations monitored by the WHO. The pandemic is in good company. The war that presses at the gates of the West proves to be ugly, dirty, bad and destined to continue over time, sowing death, fear and widespread uncertainty. Economic, energy, food, humanitarian crises in the broadest and most complex sense of the term.
26178	7	All this is combined with the alarmism, for once fully acceptable, due to the shortage of water, the blue gold of the new millennium. Mass migrations, from the south and east, will spare no country. We will have to prepare adequately, since hospitality cannot, or should not, be separated from organisation, competence and shared planning. Politics, on the other hand, dozes off, proceeds with attempts, contradicts itself, showing a fragility that leaves you stunned, simply amazed.
26178	9	Weak, fragile governments, in perpetual balance between nothingness and the relative, tending towards sweet idleness, deaf and blind to the needs of the peoples. Politics as a whole, we are not interested in indicating geographical longitudes or latitudes, is strongly requested to strike a blow, to give signs of life, not to wait for the catastrophe before intervening, placing, as usual, a patch as best you can, trying to stop hemorrhages and incurable gangrene, made such by the incompetence, and sloth, of his supporting actors.
26178	11	"While world globalism highlights structural cracks, we discuss amiably about cannabis seedlings, civil whims, democratic heroism against imaginary enemies, intolerance is fought with the ""noble"" tools of defamation, gratuitous offence, defamatory labelling, mud thrown at random to cover one's shortcomings. We need culture, love of service, humility, attachment to values, foresight and courage."
26178	13	Politics must go back to expressing excellence, valuing militancy and merit, avoiding other logics. The management of public affairs is an honor and a responsibility, not a mere job aimed at personal enrichment or the appropriation of square meters of power.
26178	15	"Let me conclude by borrowing the following statements by Carlo Maria Martini, a warning to men of all ages: ""The level of alarm is reached when the ethical decay of politics is no longer even perceived as harmful""."
2618	1	UkrLeaks: Nazis for export, from the United States to Kiev
2618	3	Apparently the US is not only exporting weapons to Ukraine in the proxy war against Russia. US neo-Nazis are also sent directly to the battlefield in Kiev, happy to reach a country like Ukraine that has now become a point of reference for the extreme right at a global level.
2618	5	This is what emerges from an investigation that appeared on UKR Leaks, a portal headed by Vasily Prozorov, former secret agent of the Ukrainian SBU until 2018. So a well-informed person with direct contacts in the field.
2618	7	Once again we see the need to denazify the Ukrainian regime confirmed, one of the reasons that prompted Russia to launch its own special military operation last February, but which in the West is defined as a laughable, pretext and propaganda motivation. In fact, in the West itself, the neo-Nazism of various formations such as the Azov Battalion has been denied.
2618	9	"Prozorov writes in UKR Leaks: ""Washington has been feeding the Nazi movements in Ukraine for many years and is regularly supplying our own National Socialists to create a 'new Reich' in the center of Europe""."
2618	11	«It may be hard to believe right away, but in the country of BLM and aggressive tolerance, the Nazis feel quite comfortable. For example, organizations such as The American Front and The National Socialist Movement (NSM), also known as the Nazi Party of America, have been operating in the United States for more than a decade.
2618	13	"American Nazis do not particularly hide their views and activities, they actively share photos, videos and ""educational"" literature, and also collect donations from like-minded people."
2618	15	"At first glance, we can call the NSM a marginally marginal grouping (…) However, the party has its own Telegram channel, which involuntarily hints at the interest of American nationalists in the ""Slavic"" public. And this is where the fun begins. The channel itself is not of particular interest, but it has a private chat in which radicals from all over the world, including Ukraine, actively participate."
2618	17	"Indeed, here comes a very interesting part which includes the recruitment of volunteers for Ukraine: «It can be seen that there are many Ukrainian citizens in the chat lists. Moreover, many participants, including Americans, openly report their participation in hostilities on the side of Ukrainian nationalists. I want to emphasize that it is the nationalists, not the APU (Kiev Armed Forces)! In particular we talk about ""Azov"" and ""Right Sector"". The chat also supports the Battalion's recruitment campaign»."
2618	19	"We then read in the investigation: «It is quite clear that among the radicals the Kiev government enjoys neither respect nor support. Accusations of an anti-Semitic nature are being brought against V. Zelensky. On the contrary, the Nazis see in Ukraine the real ""new Reich"", the core of which should be ""Azov"". The ""Fuhrer"", apparently, should be A. Biletsky. This idea is expressed by some of the most active chat participants."
26181	1	Super Mario's dilemma
26181	3	When the time for the irresponsible strikes, perceptions are altered: urgency becomes ordinary administration, drama dissolves in crazy days of recreation. It seems like a century has passed since Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's nightly press conferences, in the midst of the pandemic, who exaggerated the anguish of Italians locked up at home with verbose monologues. Yet now it is the Five Star leader himself who is playing a desperate personal game, devoted to removing the context that led to the Draghi government.
26181	5	The Prime Minister watches with phlegm the contortions of the Five Stars, the weak and unreliable link of an increasingly less armored and increasingly intolerant majority. Draghi doesn't like apodictic sentences or media shots, in fact he meditates and broods. The former president of the ECB, the technocrat called by the most responsible parties to commission a weak policy, appears appalled by the dilemma indirectly posed by the ramshackle grillina brigade. Continue with a semi-war agenda or parade before a government structure different from the one sworn in at the Quirinale in February 2021.
26181	7	In seventeen months the internal and international picture remains explosive, at the moment no one can formulate an exit from the red zone amidst the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, the cost of living which erodes increasingly meager incomes and profits, the tail end of a pandemic which it has entangled us in the nightmare of a systematic contagion. Italy, like many countries, is traveling through a dark tunnel whose exit cannot be seen. Only the Five Stars, who rant about abstention and government reshuffles, have decided by narrow political calculation to disregard the founding reasons for an emergency government based on national unity. They are the ones who have opened a crack, not so much numerical given the continuous decline in parliamentary weight, but in terms of re-discussing an alliance that is more patriotic than political. At a time when there is the greatest need for national cohesion, Conte and his Japanese in the jungle think in terms of petty tactics. Russia cuts off our gas and they curse Di Maio's split, Putin threatens an apocalyptic scenario and they play at wearing down the Prime Minister on electoral clientele such as basic income. If they leave the government, a way will be found to remedy the damage inflicted by the welfare policies imposed by the decadent visions of Beppe Grillo. And if we go back to voting sooner than expected, the Italians will have the opportunity to dismiss the true populism of the improvised people in power, those who can't distinguish a war from a quarrel in the corridor.
26185	1	"Lukashenko to the ""international scammers"" of the pandemic: ""That's enough!"""
26185	3	"Lukashenko to the ""international scammers"" of the pandemic: ""That's enough!"""
26185	5	Yesterday in a press conference the Belarusian president disavowed the entire pandemic narrative, carried out by the globalists to destroy the middle class
26185	7	"“I want to say to all these international scammers: that's enough. They have already emptied our pockets so much that there is nothing left. They stripped everyone. It is necessary to end this pandemic. Enough, they've already fooled people."" The question is put in no uncertain terms by Aleksandr Lukashenko, president of Belarus, who since the first months of 2020 has made his country a bulwark against health care dictatorships. Unlike the rest of Europe, in fact, 'White Russia' has faced Covid only on the health level, without ever imposing restrictions on civil and individual freedom, and the premier ended up in the crosshairs of media servitude when in the summer of 2020 he openly accused the WHO of having offered him 940 million euros to impose in his country the same liberticidal measures imposed in Italy. With Putin behind him, Lukashenko has never bowed to globalist interests, always unmasking the political game of economic and political destruction of the Western world that lies behind the ""pandemic""."
26185	9	Yesterday he said what everyone knows by now, except the Italian media, with Omicron Covid is now little more than a flu, urging his fellow citizens not to be afraid: “One of them, an American or Western expert, said: 'If Omicron is such an easy virus, let's all get sick and it will be a vaccine for us. From my point of view, a perfect suggestion”
2619	1	Covid, while Europe carries out the 'Japanese' Speranza remains in the pandemic jungle
2619	3	“The time has come for Sweden to open up again,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference.
2619	5	Sweden has decided to lift the restrictions (mild, however) for the pandemic next week, while the country, while still registering fairly sustained levels of infection, relies on surging immunity due to booster shots, immunity acquired by recovered and at manageable hospitalization levels to keep Covid at bay, reports the Reuters agency.
2619	7	Sweden had extended its current pandemic measures, which include early closures for bars and restaurants and a 500-person limit on indoor events, for another two weeks in late January. In general, however, in Stockholm they faced the pandemic without hysteria and relying on common sense.
2619	9	The Swedish government's decision is in line with what has been decided by other European governments who have decided to deal with Covid as if it were a flu, stating that we are at the end of the pandemic phase with the endemization of the virus.
2619	11	From 9 February, practically all the restrictions of the past will be abolished, as has already happened in Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Finland. No vaccination certificate will be mandatory anywhere.
2619	13	However, the Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza is still barricaded in the pandemic jungle, like the Japanese soldiers after the Second World War. In fact, in Rome, the extension of the green pass, red zones and limitations for the unvaccinated are still being discussed.
2619	15	As a rule, on every issue it is at the center of the political debate - because even the pandemic is a political and not a health issue - the Italian rulers look towards Europe, will it be different for the pandemic and the endless restrictions that have marked the last two years?
26191	1	It wasn't çovid that killed people but it was the lockdowns.
26191	3	"14/06/2022 - It wasn't Covid that killed people but it was the lockdowns. The flu virus called COVID has not claimed as many lives as the common seasonal flu. It was the forced confinements that caused the anomaly of deaths. Now it is the scientists themselves who say it. Locking people up at home, suspending treatment with ""watchful waiting and tachypirine"" killed people. Finally, a large part of the population has understood this and now there is no city, no place, where the Minister of Health Speranza goes that he is not shouted ""MURDERER"". It happened in Palermo, Messina, Bologna, Forenze, etc."
26191	5	"The global coup via the ""pandemic"" failed thanks to men like Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Víctor Orban and Aleksandr Lukashenko who was the first to denounce the attempted corruption by the Davos elite. At the end of this story, those responsible must be brought to justice."
26196	1	Let's play French
26196	3	Let's play a political game, actually a political fantasy. Let's pretend that we are French, or that the French are us, with all their institutional and electoral system. So let's imagine that Emmanuel Macron is Enrico Letta, that Marine Le Pen is Giorgia Meloni, Jean Luc Mélenchon is Giuseppe Conte, Eric Zemmour is Matteo Salvini, and gradually all the others descend, with the Gaullist Valerie Pecresse in the role of Silvio Berlusconi and the socialist Anne Hidalgo in those of the more leftist left, that is Pier Luigi Bersani, Roberto Speranza, Nicola Fratoianni. In addition, but very lateral, the other defeated French candidates who in Italy could be embodied by Matteo Renzi, Carlo Calenda and centrists of various order and rank. Of course we have to play as if we were in a semi-presidential system, precisely in the French style, in which the president of the republic is elected by the people and is essentially the head of the government, with a two-round electoral law which provides for a run-off between the first two arrivals . The others have to make do with a small right to the rostrum and electoral reimbursements should they exceed 5 percent of the votes.
26196	5	According to the polls available to us, Letta and Meloni would go to the ballot, a direct challenge between right and left that recalls those between Prodi and Berlusconi in 1996 and 2006. In this case, however, there would be no coalition of five, six, seven or even nine parties to support the two candidates, with consequent and legitimate claims from ministries and undersecretariats, mixed blackmail and little cabotage games, but at most explanations of vote for one or the other. Exactly as is happening in France these days. Then, after the result, it will be up to whoever wins to open or not his government to some representative of the minor forces who have invited their electors to vote for him or her. In any case, the victor will have a lot of power, just enough to allow him to govern for the entire legislature.
26196	7	So let's see how all the athletes on the pitch could play the game. The two protagonists will try to acquire the votes available on the square, Letta will have the most difficult task having to turn to both the left and the center, or will have to try to propose a program that can convince Conte, Bersani, Fratoianni, Renzi and Calenda, and not the it will be enough to appeal to a sort of popular front against the right: instead it will have to make an effort to explain to voters what it intends to do on all the issues on the agenda of a country that will not have emerged from the economic crisis, caused by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine. Put simply, he will have to expose himself on taxes, that is, who has to pay more and who less, on the recipients of the few available resources, on civil rights, on immigrants and so on. It will not be easy for him to convince the leaders and voters who are so different and very often at odds with each other to vote for him, especially the grillini and the left-wing radicals who do not like (euphemism) the Renzians and the Calendians. And viceversa.
26196	9	"For Meloni the game seems simpler, after all the values ​​(let's call them that) of the Italian right are very similar if not the same. What would be the differences between the Brothers of Italy and the League? Very few, so it is very likely that Salvini's voters would vote convinced and en masse for Giorgia Meloni. The situation for those who still identify with Forza Italia is slightly different: although the ""fear"" of the left, of the communists, the Cavaliere would say, may also apply to them, some would not feel at ease with a sovereign and substantially anti-European president, for more escorted by Salvini. As well as the same voters of Renzi and Calenda, who would hardly vote for Meloni at the Quirinale. While among the Cinquestelle, where we find people who come from the left together with others who have a history and a culture that has nothing to do with the left, there could be someone who can give his vote to Meloni. Perhaps recalling the ""good times"" of the alliance with the sovereignist Salvini."
26196	11	So long live the French system that would allow us to have a President elected directly by the people, who could govern in peace for five years, without obstacles, blackmail and veto rights of the parties? Or better to keep our system, in which the people vote for the parties who then represent them in Parliament, which in turn elects the prime minister, who must answer to Parliament, as will Parliament, i.e. the parties that make it up, which in the following elections will he have to give an account to the people of what has or has not been done? From the point of view of functionality, governance, efficiency and speed of decisions, it is clear that the first hypothesis would be better. But from that of democracy, pluralism and representation, the latter would be better. Let's put it this way: if Giorgia Meloni were elected directly by the citizens, then we would have to keep her in Palazzo Chigi, indeed at the Quirinale, for five years. If, on the other hand, you become prime minister by the will of the majority of parliamentarians, this will could also change overnight. Here, better not to risk it.
26199	1	Scholz: The EU is the antithesis of imperialism and autocracy
26199	3	The European Union can no longer afford national vetoes in foreign policy: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz writes this in an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dedicated to the consequences for Germany and Europe of the Russian war in Ukraine. “Imperialism is back in Europe. Many hoped that the close economic ties and mutual dependencies would ensure stability and security at the same time. Putin has now visibly destroyed that hope with his war against Ukraine. Russian missiles have not only caused massive destruction in Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson, but have also reduced the European and international peace order of the past decades to rubble,” writes the Social Democratic Chancellor.
26199	5	"Scholz advocates the need for a ""geopolitical European Union"": for the German chancellor, the member countries must close ranks in all the policies on which there has been disagreement so far, such as migration policy, common defence, technological sovereignty. The federal government, writes Scholz, will make proposals on the matter in the coming months. The German chancellor then stresses that we need to put an end to the ""selfish blocks of European decisions by individual member states""."
26205	1	Russia is preparing for the offensive on the home front
26205	3	24 May 2022 Russia is preparing for the offensive on the home front
26205	5	In conditions where it is impossible to break Russia by external aggression, Western politicians are preparing an internal destabilization of Russia
26205	7	During his speech to the 30th Assembly of the Foreign and Defense Policy Council, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, describing the current situation, explained that “the collective West” has declared an all-out hybrid war against us. It is by no means an exaggeration, the French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, announced an all-out financial and economic war against Russia in March of this year.
26205	9	The fight against external dangers is evident to everyone and the willingness to do so is greater, at the same time the fight on the internal front has always been the most difficult, and this internal front is precisely the battleground on which the countries of the ' West are now trying to organize against Russia..
26205	11	"During his visit to Europe after Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine, US President Joe Biden said on March 26 that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot stay in power. Shortly thereafter, a White House spokesman clarified that Biden had not called for a change of power in Russia: ""The president believes that Putin should not be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors."""
26205	13	However, one must understand that such a statement by Biden is by no means an improvisation of an elderly person shocking the public with his speeches. Speaking in Warsaw, they read a text prepared by a teleprompter, only one of the authors of this speech was too frank. The official authorities in the West are not ready to enter into direct conflict with Russia, as this is fraught with the danger of a third world war, and therefore they publicly deny their intentions to change power in Russia.
26205	15	"""Regime change in Russia is not NATO's goal,"" explained German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “We are not looking for regime change in Moscow. But let me be clear: a weakened Russia is a consequence of Putin's decision to launch an unwarranted invasion, said British Foreign Office chief Liz Truss."
26205	17	All of these claims are not credible. Already on December 7, 2021, during her testimony to the US Senate, Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland explained that it was planned to isolate Russia from the global financial system, with all the ensuing consequences for business Russians and their population. At the same time, Reuters, citing an unnamed White House official, reported that the pending sanctions would severely impact Russian consumers, businesses and employment.
26205	19	It is also worth paying attention to the publication in the American magazine The Atlantic, written by a former adviser to the US State Department. Earlier, in March 2021, before all the aggravations in Ukraine began, I drew the readers' attention to one of the articles by former American diplomats, in which they shared their plans for Ukraine, and concluded that the United States would try to take revenge there and take this country under its control.
26205	21	This time, the former US official quoted by The Atlantic is saying bluntly that the US should signal to the Russian elite that the country has no future under the presidency of Vladimir Putin. Russia under Vladimir Putin is a deeply dangerous state, says the article.
26205	23	It is in the interests of the West to keep Russia weak, internally divided and militarily impotent. Under such conditions, although the “liberalizing revolution” may come, there is no reason to act as if it has already arrived or is inevitable, the author believes.
26205	25	Therefore, even when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is resolved and official sanctions are lifted, it makes sense by all possible means to discourage Western companies from doing business there in order to stir up public discontent.
26205	27	"Therefore, the United States has not hidden and is not hiding that its goal is to put pressure on ordinary Russians to change the policy of the Russian leadership and, possibly, the entire leadership. Now US Senator Lindsey Graham, explaining the need to allocate 40 billion dollars to Ukraine, says that there is a chance of defeating Russia. Otherwise, her actions will change the face of Europe and send the ""wrong signals"" to China. You do not hesitate to say that one of the US goals is a change of power in Russia."
26205	29	Lindsey Graham, a 66-year-old neocon and US “deep state” representative who has maintained a Russophobic streak under Donald Trump's presidency, has previously said that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power. Of course, it is not only in the US Congress, the House of Representatives has also approved the bill on the allocation of 40 billion dollars to Ukraine with an overwhelming majority of 388 votes in favor and 57 against.
26205	31	US foreign policy veteran Henry Kissinger told the Financial Times in an interview that the US is being forced to engage in regime change in authoritarian countries as authoritarian regimes multiply new types of ever more destructive and sophisticated weapons that could threaten the United States. Of course, all this was said with reference to the confrontation between the USA and Russia in Ukraine.
26205	33	However, the reign of the neocons and this approach to foreign policy in the United States is coming to an end. Senator Rand Paul, introducing his amendment to the bill, temporarily blocked the allocation of 40 billion dollars to Kiev. Explaining his actions, he stated that he did not want Ukraine to succeed at the cost of US failure.
26205	35	Other Republicans have also spoken out publicly against bailouts for Ukraine because spending dollars in another country means the federal government can't control the Mexican border and young parents can't find infant formula for their children.
26205	37	Donald Trump Jr. and the new Republican candidates are strongly against helping Ukraine, explaining that the money will go to war and bribe officials in the United States itself. Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, who won the Republican Party primaries, was alone among the contenders who opposed American intervention in the situation in Ukraine.
26205	39	Even the New York Times , which has always adhered to the point of view of the Democratic Party of the United States, in the matter of providing 40 billion in aid to Ukraine, dwells on the ease with which American lawmakers on both sides give the money of the taxpayers to another country, although more recently they have fought each other to finance their own citizens, trying to balance the costs.
26205	41	All this suggests that the current ruling elites in the United States do not have much time, as the problems of the United States require urgent solutions. Therefore, they are starting to twist the situation to destabilize Russia right now. So, for example, the US CIA distributed instructions in Russian explaining how to get in touch with them on the Internet.
26205	43	"The CIA asks people using the instructions to give their full name, their official position, and what access they have to information of interest to US intelligence. According to the Washington Post, the instruction was published in connection with the desire of US intelligence to establish contact with the Russians, who were ""concerned"" by a special military operation in Ukraine. Therefore, the American side intends to step up the recruitment of Russians."
26205	45	Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director Sergei Naryshkin said the US State Department had instructed controlled non-governmental organizations to launch a campaign to discredit the military operation in Ukraine in Russian society. The general message circulating on social media is that Western-backed Ukraine is about to inflict a crushing defeat on Russia and “only a large-scale civil protest is supposedly able to save the country from an imminent catastrophe”.
26205	47	For his part, the Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov described the cynicism of the situation : “The horror is that well-known (US) politicians, whom I previously quite respected, whose knowledge I highly valued, publish appeals in the Media Americans to Russian diplomats and the military to go over to the side of so-called democracy. In fact, my comrades are driven to betrayal, which in any country is considered a disgusting act, ”he said on Solovyov Live.
26205	49	“My comrades, embassy staff, are receiving threats, including physical violence. And American intelligence figures flirt around the Russian embassy, ​​handing out FBI and CIA phones, which they offer to call to establish “cooperation” contacts. “Targeted mailings are sent to mobile phone numbers, ads with addresses of special services and invitations to respond to these appeals,” Antonov said.
26205	51	"Therefore, it is not surprising that the American “Radio Liberty”, included by the Russian Ministry of Justice in the list of media acting as foreign agents, introduces the idea that “Russian elites understand that the war is lost”. However, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) has now ""dragged out of mothballs"" Mikhail Kasyanov, a former Russian statesman who has now left Russia and is in hiding in Europe."
26205	53	In the above interview, it was the DW reporter who set the tone with a bias towards a change of power in Russia. Kasyanov himself expressed the hope that Western sanctions would hit the Russian middle class with constant access to the Internet, and through this communication channel Kasyanov's supporters would be able to influence the situation in Russia to change the current government.
26205	55	Therefore, it is obvious that the current level of Western agitation calling for a change of power in Russia has already surpassed the level of the Soviet era. Undisguised agitation is carried out not only in relation to ordinary Russians, but also in relation to diplomats and civil servants.
26205	57	Russia is now in a situation where external pressure cannot break it and only an internal explosion can divide the country. The Russian people just need to show patience and wait out the storm to break the world order, because Russia has all the necessary resources for that. Then the people will not have to rebuild the country from the rubble, as has already happened in our history, but it will be possible to build a new world order based on the interests of Russia.

26210	5	The Russian special operation in Ukraine has uncovered the Pandora's box of US biolaboratories in the former Soviet republic, which however are only a few of the dozens of laboratories of this type that the USA manages all over the world. During the special operation, the Russians came into possession of burning documents that nail Washington to its responsibilities, despite the fact that the Western press continues to ignore the issue.
26210	7	Igor Kirillov, head of the Russian Federation's Radioactive, Chemical and Biological Protection Force, recently revealed new information that seriously questions the safety standards of Ukrainian biolaboratories. According to documents in the possession of the Russians, the USA had allocated about 15 million dollars to increase the level of security of the laboratory in Merefa, a city in the Kharkiv oblast, however the Ukrainian officials replied that the modernization of the security system would been impossible, until the facility was commissioned in violation of safety regulations and requirements. This also means that nobody knows where the 15 million disbursed by the US authorities have gone.
26210	9	Kirillov also revealed that the searches in Ukraine were supported not only by the United States, but also by Poland and Germany. However, none of the countries involved has had the foresight to notify the United Nations of the existence of this joint project. Kirillov recalled that each signatory to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is required to submit an annual report to demonstrate the compliance of their research with the terms of the international agreement, however, in the declarations presented by Ukraine, the United States, Poland and Germany there is no is no trace of research carried out in Ukrainian biolaboratories.
26210	11	"Lt. Gen. Kirillov stressed that Ukraine said in reports for 2016-2020 that its government had not conducted and was not conducting any offensive or defensive activities under biological research and development programs, according to reports by the TASS news agency. “This contradicts the statement made by Lewis Gitter, Deputy Political Advisor to the US Mission to the OSCE, on May 20, 2022,” the Russian official explained. At the time, Gitter said aid had been sent to Kiev ""to reduce biological threats and support veterinary and public health to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks"" and ""to secure illegal biological weapons left behind in former Soviet states."" after the fall of the USSR“."
26210	13	“It begs a question: why was the work under the joint military biological projects codenamed UP not mentioned in the reports submitted by the US and Ukraine to the UN? This secrecy is a reason to question the real goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine,” Kirillov commented. As we ourselves had already had the opportunity to underline in previous articles, Kirillov pointed out the existence of reports from the Ukrainian secret services about the activity of US biolaboratories in Ukraine, which were considered as a threat by the same intelligence in Kiev.
26210	15	"In recent days, an article by Shan Jie and Fan Wei published in the Chinese newspaper Global Times raised the question of the US program known as ""Insect Allies"", which could transform insects into lethal biological weapons. The Pentagon project involves transmitting genetically modified viruses to plants by altering crop genes. Officially, the project would serve to avoid famines, allowing agriculture in unfavorable climates and defending plants from diseases, but in reality this project can be used as a weapon, obtaining exactly the opposite effect, namely that of destroying foodstuffs of the enemy, or to spread deadly diseases among the population."
26210	17	“Why do they use insects as vectors? Why is the US building bio-labs near other countries like Russia? When Pandora's box is opened, a series of disasters will follow,” said an expert interviewed by the Global Times.
26210	19	However, this project represents only the tip of the iceberg of the many covert operations conducted by the United States around the planet. In addition to the Insect Allies program, the United States has conducted biological experiments all over the world in their biolaboratories, violating all international conventions in this regard, as well as the rules of safety and ethics.
26210	21	The Insect Allies project was launched in 2017 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for developing high-tech military applications. As early as April 2018, an article in Science warned that the US defense project could turn insects into biological weapons. “If successful, the technique could be used by malicious actors to help spread disease to nearly any crop species and devastate crops,” read the well-known scientific journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which pointed out also that “the research could be considered as a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention“.
26210	23	"Similar comments were provided by Germany's Max Planck Institute, according to which the insects in the project ""could easily be misused for the development of biological weapons"", and by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), an international organization which deals with environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry. According to SETAC, “the combination of a virus-induced genetic modification of field-grown plants using genetically modified insect vectors poses a greater risk than the hitherto existing use of genetically modified organisms.” “Due to the broad prohibition of the Biological Weapons Convention, any biological research of interest must be plausibly justified as serving peaceful purposes. The Insect Allies program could violate the Biological Weapons Convention, if the reasons presented by DARPA are implausible“, Observed the Teutonic institute instead."
26210	25	“It would be deadly to turn an insect into a biological weapon, because until now viruses in crops have been very difficult to control. Once an infected crop develops symptoms, it is nearly impossible to save. And the virus continues to vary, making prevention even more difficult,” said Zhang Jie, an expert at the Plant Protection Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
26210	27	The Insect Allies program, as we mentioned earlier, is just one of many instances where US research has been accused of causing dire consequences around the world, especially through the use of biological laboratories. The United States has openly admitted that it operates 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries of the world, including 26 in Ukraine. However, there are enough documents to state that the US has signed contracts with at least 49 countries.
26210	29	One of these countries, in addition to the aforementioned Ukraine, is the other former Soviet republic of Georgia. In 2014, the US-built Lugar Center near Tbilisi was equipped with an insect facility and launched a project called “Raising Awareness about Barcoding of Sand Flies in Georgia and Caucasus”. A few months later, Tbilisi was infested with biting flies which developed behavior atypical of what they had previously displayed, including extraordinary longevity and resistance to cold. Biting flies have also been found in the neighboring Dagestan region of Russia.
26210	31	All this must raise serious questions about what are the real intentions of the United States regarding the numerous researches that they conduct illegally all over the world, without adequately informing the international bodies in charge.
26219	1	Communications from President Draghi to the Senate of the Republic
26219	3	Mister President,
26219	5	Honorable Senators and Senators,
26219	7	Last Thursday I handed in my resignation to the President of the Republic.
26219	9	This decision followed the loss of the majority of national unity that has supported this government since its inception.
26219	11	The President of the Republic rejected my resignation and asked me to inform Parliament of what happened – a decision I shared.
26219	13	Today's Communications allow me to explain to you and to all Italians the reasons for a choice that was as painful as it was due.
26219	15	Last February, the President of the Republic entrusted me with the task of forming a government to deal with the three emergencies facing Italy: pandemic, economic, social.
26219	17	"""A government"" - these were his words - ""of a high profile, which should not be identified with any political formula""."
26219	19	"""A government that promptly deals with serious emergencies that cannot be postponed""."
26219	21	All the main parties - with one exception - decided to respond positively to that appeal.
26219	23	"In the inauguration speech I gave in this hall, I explicitly referred to the ""republican spirit"" of the government, which would be based on the assumption of national unity."
26219	25	In recent months, national unity has been the best guarantee of the democratic legitimacy of this executive and its effectiveness.
26219	27	I believe that a Prime Minister who has never presented himself before the electors must have the broadest possible support in Parliament.
26219	29	This assumption is even more important in an emergency context, in which the Government has to make decisions that profoundly affect the lives of Italians.
26219	31	"The very broad consensus that the Government enjoyed in Parliament allowed for that ""timeliness"" in the decisions that the President of the Republic had requested."
26219	33	For a long time the forces of the majority have been able to put aside divisions and converge with a sense of state and generosity towards rapid and effective interventions, for the good of all citizens.
26219	35	Thanks to the health containment measures, the vaccination campaign, the economic support measures for families and businesses, we have managed to overcome the most acute phase of the pandemic, to give impetus to the economic recovery.
26219	37	The boost to investments and the protection of household incomes has allowed us to emerge faster than other countries from the recession caused by the pandemic.
26219	39	Last year the economy grew by 6.6% and the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product fell by 4.5 percentage points.
26219	41	The drafting of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, approved with a very large majority by this Parliament, has launched a path of reforms and investments that is unprecedented in recent history.
26219	43	The reforms of justice, competition, taxation, procurement - in addition to the substantial simplification agenda - are an essential step forward for modernizing Italy.
26219	45	To date, all the objectives of the first two semesters of the PNRR have been achieved.
26219	47	We have already received 45.9 billion euros from the European Commission, to which a further 21 billion will be added in the coming weeks - for a total of almost 67 billion.
26219	49	With the strong parliamentary support of the majority and the opposition, we reacted with absolute firmness to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
26219	51	Condemnation of Russian atrocities and full support for Ukraine have shown how Italy can and should have a leading role within the European Union and the G7.
26219	53	At the same time, we have never ceased our pursuit of peace – a peace that must be acceptable to Ukraine, sustainable, lasting.
26219	55	We were among the first to commit ourselves so that Russia and Ukraine could work together to avoid a food catastrophe, and at the same time open a window of negotiation.
26219	57	The progress recorded in Turkey last week is encouraging, and we hope it can be consolidated.
26219	59	We have moved very quickly to overcome the unacceptable energy dependence on Russia – the result of decades of short-sighted and dangerous choices.
26219	61	In just a few months, we have reduced our imports of Russian gas from 40% to less than 25% of the total and intend to bring them to zero within a year and a half.
26219	63	It is a result that seemed unthinkable, which gives peace of mind for the future to industry and families, strengthens our national security, our credibility in the world.
26219	65	We have accelerated, with profound simplifications and massive investments, on the renewable energy front, to defend the environment and increase our energy independence.
26219	67	And we have intervened with determination to protect citizens and businesses from the consequences of the energy crisis, with particular attention to the weakest.
26219	69	We have allocated 33 billion in just over a year, almost two percentage points of GDP, despite our limited public finance margins.
26219	71	We were able to do this thanks to a newfound collective credibility, which contained the increase in the cost of debt even in a phase of rising interest rates.
26219	73	The credit for these results was yours - for your willingness to put aside your differences and work for the good of the country, with equal dignity, with mutual respect.
26219	75	Yours was the best response to last February's appeal from the President of the Republic and to the request for seriousness, the need for protection, the concerns for the future that came from citizens.
26219	77	The Italians have in turn supported this civil miracle, and have become the real protagonists of the policies that we implemented from time to time.
26219	79	I am thinking of the patient respect for the restrictions to curb the pandemic, of the extraordinary participation in the vaccination campaign.
26219	81	I am thinking of the spontaneous welcome offered to Ukrainian refugees, welcomed into homes and schools with affection and solidarity.
26219	83	I am thinking of the involvement of local communities in the PNRR, which has made it the largest grassroots transformation project in recent history.
26219	85	Never as in these moments have I been proud to be Italian.
26219	87	Italy is strong when it knows how to be united.
26219	89	Unfortunately, as the months went by, the political forces opposed this demand for cohesion that came from the citizens with a growing desire for distinction and division.
26219	91	The reforms of the Superior Council of the Judiciary, of the cadastre, of the seaside concessions have shown a progressive crumbling of the majority on the country's modernization agenda.
26219	93	In foreign policy, we have seen attempts to undermine government support for Ukraine, to weaken our opposition to President Putin's agenda.
26219	95	Calls for more borrowing grew louder just as the need for attention to debt sustainability was greatest.
26219	97	"The desire to move forward together has gradually faded and with it the ability to act effectively, with ""timeliness"", in the interest of the country."
26219	99	As I said in the Council of Ministers, last Thursday's vote certified the end of the pact of trust that held this majority together.
26219	101	Not voting confidence in a government you belong to is a clear political gesture, which has an obvious meaning.
26219	103	It cannot be ignored, because it would be tantamount to ignoring Parliament.
26219	105	It is not possible to contain it, because it would mean that anyone can repeat it.
26219	107	It cannot be minimized, because it comes after months of snatches and ultimatums.
26219	109	The only way, if we still want to stay together, is to rebuild this pact from scratch, with courage, altruism, credibility.
26219	111	It is mainly the Italians who ask for it.
26219	113	The mobilization of these days by citizens, associations, territories in favor of the continuation of the Government is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.
26219	115	It involved the third sector, school and university, the world of the economy, professions and entrepreneurship, sport.
26219	117	This is undeserved support, but one for which I am enormously grateful.
26219	119	Two appeals struck me in a particular way.
26219	121	The first is that of around 2,000 mayors, authorities used to dealing with the problems of their communities on a daily basis.
26219	123	The second is that of healthcare personnel, the heroes of the pandemic, to whom our collective gratitude is immense.
26219	125	This question of stability requires us all to decide whether it is possible to recreate the conditions in which the government can truly govern.
26219	127	This is the heart of our discussion today.
26219	129	This is the sense of the commitment we have to deal with before the citizens.
26219	131	Italy needs a government capable of moving effectively and promptly on at least four fronts.
26219	133	The National Recovery and Resilience Plan is a unique opportunity to improve our long-term growth, create opportunities for young people and women, heal inequalities starting from those between North and South.
26219	135	By the end of this year, we must achieve 55 goals, which will allow us to receive a new installment of 19 billion euros.
26219	137	The objectives concern fundamental issues such as digital infrastructures, support for tourism, the creation of university accommodation and research scholarships, the fight against undeclared work.
26219	139	Completing the PNRR is a matter of seriousness towards our citizens and towards our European partners.
26219	141	If we don't show that we know how to spend this money efficiently and honestly, it will be impossible to ask for new common crisis management tools.
26219	143	The advancement of the PNRR requires the realization of the many investments that make it up.
26219	145	From railways to broadband, from nursery schools to community houses, we must commit ourselves to realizing all the projects we have designed with the decisive contribution of local communities.
26219	147	We must be united against useless bureaucracy, which too often delays the country's development.
26219	149	And we must make sure that local authorities - starting with the Municipalities - have all the necessary tools to overcome any implementation problems.
26219	151	At the same time, we must proceed quickly with the reforms which, together with investment, are at the heart of the PNRR.
26219	153	The reform of the public procurement code intends to ensure the rapid completion of public works and the strengthening of the tools for the fight against corruption.
26219	155	We must keep the mafias away from the PNRR.
26219	157	It's the best way to honor the memory of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the men and women of their escorts, thirty years after their barbaric killing.
26219	159	The reform of the procurement code has been approved, and work is underway to prepare the outlines of delegated decrees which must be dismissed by March next year.
26219	161	Competition reform serves to promote growth, reduce rents, encourage investment and employment.
26219	163	In this spirit, we have approved regulations to remove the obstacles to market opening and consumer protection.
26219	165	The reform affects local public services, including taxis, and concessions for goods and services, including beach concessions.
26219	167	The bill must be approved before the summer break, to allow further approval of the delegated decrees by the end of the year, as required by the PNRR.
26219	169	What is now needed is convinced support for executive action – not support for unauthorized, and sometimes violent, protests against the ruling majority.
26219	171	As far as justice is concerned, we approved the reform of the criminal trial, the civil trial and the bankruptcy procedures and brought the tax justice reform to Parliament.
26219	173	These reforms are essential to have fair and rapid processes, as the Italians ask us.
26219	175	It is a matter of freedom, democracy, and also prosperity.
26219	177	The deadlines set by the PNRR are very precise.
26219	179	We have to complete the procedure envisaged for the implementation decrees of the civil and criminal enabling law by the end of the year.
26219	181	The tax justice reform law is under discussion in the Senate and must be approved by the end of the year.
26219	183	Finally, last autumn, the Government gave the go-ahead for the draft law for the revision of the tax authorities.
26219	185	We are aware that taxation in Italy is complex and often unfair.
26219	187	This is why we have never raised taxes on citizens.
26219	189	However, for this it is necessary to proceed with an effort of transparency.
26219	191	We intend to reduce the personal income tax rates starting from low-middle incomes; overcome the IRAP; rationalize VAT.
26219	193	The first steps were taken with the latest budget law, which initiated the revision of the Irpef and the reform of the collection system.
26219	195	In Italy, the Revenue-Collection Agency counts 1,100 billion euros of residual credits, i.e. uncollected, equal to over 60% of the national gross domestic product – an impressive figure.
26219	197	We must therefore approve the tax reform as soon as possible, which includes the completion of the tax collection reform, and launch the implementing decrees immediately afterwards.
26219	199	Alongside the PNRR, there is a need for a real social agenda, which starts with the weakest, such as the disabled and the elderly who are not self-sufficient.
26219	201	Rising energy costs and the return of inflation have caused new inequalities, which aggravate those produced by the pandemic.
26219	203	Since the inception of the government, we have shared a working method with the trade unions and business associations that provides for regular meetings and roundtables.
26219	205	This method has already been used to manage some emergencies in the country: from the resumption of production activities in the pandemic phase to job security, on which much has been done and much still remains to be done.
26219	207	Today it is essential to continue this discussion and to define the interventions to be implemented in the next budget law from a shared perspective.
26219	209	This year, the public finance performance is better than expected and allows us to intervene, as we have done so far, without new budget slippages.
26219	211	A substantial measure must be adopted by the first days of August to mitigate the impact on citizens and businesses of the increase in energy costs, and then strengthen purchasing power, especially of the weaker sections of the population.
26219	213	Reducing the tax burden on workers, starting with the lowest wages, is a medium-term goal.
26219	215	This is a point on which trade unions and entrepreneurs agree.
26219	217	With the last budget law we adopted a first and temporary intervention.
26219	219	We must add another one quickly, within the limits allowed by our financial resources.
26219	221	We also need to push the renewal of collective agreements.
26219	223	Many, including those in commerce and services, have expired for too many years.
26219	225	Collective bargaining is one of the strengths of our industrial model, due to the extent and quality of protection, but it does not yet reach all workers.
26219	227	At European level, a directive on the minimum wage is in the process of being definitively approved, and it is in this direction that we must move, together with the social partners, ensuring decent wage levels for the groups of workers most suffering.
26219	229	Citizenship income is an important measure to reduce poverty, but it can be improved to benefit those most in need and reduce negative effects on the labor market.
26219	231	There is a need for a pension reform that guarantees outgoing flexibility mechanisms and a sustainable system, anchored to the contribution system.
26219	233	Italy must continue to redesign its energy policy, as it has done in recent months.
26219	235	This week's Summit in Algiers confirms our absolute determination to diversify our suppliers, push hard on renewable energy.
26219	237	To do this, you need the necessary infrastructure.
26219	239	We need to speed up the installation of the regasification terminals – in Piombino and Ravenna.
26219	241	It is not possible to say that you want energy security for Italians and then, at the same time, protest against these infrastructures.
26219	243	These are safe systems, essential for our energy needs, for the maintenance of our productive fabric.
26219	245	In particular, we must complete the installation of the Piombino regasification terminal by next spring.
26219	247	It's a matter of national security.
26219	249	At the same time, we must continue the energy transition towards clean sources as a matter of urgency.
26219	251	By 2030 we need to install around 70 GW of renewable energy plants.
26219	253	The drought and anomalous heat waves that have hit Europe in recent weeks remind us of the urgency of tackling the climate crisis as a whole seriously.
26219	255	I am also thinking of the interventions to improve the management of water resources, the maintenance of which has often been seriously deficient.
26219	257	"The PNRR allocates more than 4 billion for these investments, which must be accompanied by a more urgent ""water plan""."
26219	259	As regards energy efficiency measures and more generally building bonuses, we intend to address the critical issues in the transfer of tax credits, but at the same time reduce the generosity of contributions.
26219	261	As promised in my inaugural speech, and supported by you in this hall, this government identifies itself fully with the European Union, with the transatlantic link.
26219	263	Our position is clear and strong: in the heart of the European Union, the G7, NATO.
26219	265	We must continue to support Ukraine in every way, as this Parliament has committed the Government to do with a parliamentary resolution.
26219	267	As President Zelensky repeated to me on the phone yesterday, arming Ukraine is the only way for the Ukrainians to defend themselves.
26219	269	At the same time, we must continue to strive to seek negotiated solutions, starting with the wheat crisis.
26219	271	And we must increase efforts to combat interference by Russia and other autocracies in our politics, in our society.
26219	273	Italy is a free and democratic country.
26219	275	We must respond with the strength of European values ​​to those who try to seduce us with their authoritarian model.
26219	277	The European Union is our home and within it we must carry on ambitious challenges.
26219	279	We must continue to fight to obtain a ceiling on the price of Russian gas, which would benefit everyone, and for the reform of the electricity market, which can begin with the domestic one even before European agreements are reached.
26219	281	These measures are essential to defend the purchasing power of families and to protect the production levels of businesses.
26219	283	In Europe, the reform of the budgetary and common defense rules and the overcoming of the unanimity principle will also soon be discussed.
26219	285	In all these fields, Italy has a lot to say – with credibility, a constructive spirit, and without any subordination.
26219	287	There are other commitments that the executive wants to make which concern, for example, the reform of the general practitioner system and the discussion for the recognition of forms of differentiated autonomy.
26219	289	But all of this requires a Government that is truly strong and cohesive and a Parliament that accompanies it with conviction, in mutual respect for roles.
26219	291	Italy does not need a facade of trust, which vanishes in the face of inconvenient measures.
26219	293	We need a new pact of trust, sincere and concrete, like the one that has allowed us up to now to change the country for the better.
26219	295	The parties and you parliamentarians - are you ready to rebuild this pact?
26219	297	Are you ready to confirm the effort you made in the first few months, and which then faded away?
26219	299	I am here, in this hall today, at this point in the discussion, only because the Italians have asked for it.
26219	301	You must not give this answer to these questions to me, but you must give it to all Italians.
26224	1	Draghi meets (only) his friend Letta. From pastrocchio to centre-left government?
26224	3	Rome, July 19 - Thus it was that Mario Draghi met Enrico Letta, a faithful companion in the adventures and (above all) misadventures of the government of the mediocre. He has met only him (for now), without annoying allies who question the alliance, just to evaluate what to do. Let's assume? A center-left government, with a few pieces of Forza Italia and no Lega.
26224	5	"Draghi meets (only) Letta. Lega and Forza Italia: ""Bewilderment"""
26224	7	"Possible? No numbers in hand, unless the pentastellato firmament is recomposed for this purpose. Contiani, Dimaiani, ex Contiani, various defectors, all inside the bandwagon. And who knows, even some centrist crutch that always pops up when necessary, to be fished a little from the Mixed Group, a little here, a little there, so much so that the new Christian Democrats dwell everywhere. And then come on, someone willing to keep the rickety shack standing and keep the armchair planted in it is always found. The fact is that at Lega and Forza Italia, today's lunch suddenly went sideways to the news of the conversation between Letta and the outgoing premier. ""At the beginning of the center-right government summit, bewilderment was expressed because President Mario Draghi received the secretary of the Democratic Party and not the leaders of the other majority parties, after, moreover, a political verification had been requested"", reveals the 'Ansa, citing sources from the centre-right government meeting in Villa Grande."
26224	9	Yes, because in Berlusconi's Roman residence, the Northern League, Forzisti and what remains of the UDC were discussing how to reiterate the veto to the Five Stars, when they suddenly found themselves with this not very welcome news. So now what does the Salvini-Cav pairing intend to do? Will he demand a candlelight meeting late in the evening, will he break the bank or will he wait silently until Draghi's speech scheduled for tomorrow morning? Certainly, regardless of the moves of the center-right and although the road to Draghi bis appears increasingly impervious, a way to fix the pieces can always be found in order to avoid elections.
26224	11	"In fact, among the main parties that make up Parliament (but not the majority), only the Brothers of Italy continues to clamor for a return to the polls. “According to the press, it seems that all of Italy is begging Draghi to stay, as if this government were in the hearts of all Italians. But then the same press warns that if there were votes, the opposition would win hands down. Typical cognitive dissonances of the left”, writes Giorgia Meloni on Twitter. ""That's why they are trying everything to avoid going back to the vote immediately..."", adds the leader of FdI on Facebook, publishing a recent survey by Swg which gives Fdi at 23.8%. Polls that speak volumes about the current appreciation of Italians for the forces that support Draghi."
26227	1	Not again! Biden Unveils Another $700 Million For Ukraine's Weapons!
26227	3	While promising not to send long-range missiles to Ukraine, President Biden has announced that he will send long-range missiles to Ukraine. He also unveiled another $700 million in arms for Ukraine (this part of the $40 billion… or is it already used up?). Even today: EUROPOL (finally) wakes up to the nightmare of billions of weapons flooding Europe from Ukraine.

2623	1	Soros calls for Putin's defeat
2623	3	Unless Russia is swiftly defeated in Ukraine, the collective West will not be able to tackle climate change in time to save civilization, billionaire financier George Soros said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also called Russia and China the biggest threats to his concept of an open society.
2623	5	"Russia's sending of troops to Ukraine ""may have been the start of World War III and our civilization may not survive,"" Soros told the WEF, and even when the fighting stops, ""the situation won't come back."" never again to the one before."""
2623	7	"In his account, the ""invasion"" occurred in the midst of a struggle between ""two systems of government diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society"", the former embodied by the West and the latter by Russia and China."
2623	9	"Soros, 91, recalled the ""exciting days"" of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when his wealth soared to the point where he could spend $300 million a year in 1987, and his foundations in Eastern Europe ""came proved more effective than I expected."""
2623	11	The Hungarian financier failed to mention the collapse in living standards that followed for ordinary citizens.
2623	13	"He said the tide began to turn after the 2001 September 11 attacks, ""repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege"", with China and Russia posing ""the biggest threat""."
2623	15	"However, Soros was optimistic about how that fight would go. According to him, Russian troops should be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators and emerge victorious within days or weeks, but Ukraine was able to ""defeat"" them with the help of the United States and NATO. Meanwhile, he said Chinese leader Xi Jinping damaged his legitimacy with the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai and elsewhere."
2623	17	What really worried Soros, however, was that the conflict in Ukraine interfered with the environmental agenda, meaning that climate change could become irreversible.
2623	19	"The best and perhaps the only way to preserve our civilization is to defeat Putin as soon as possible, he added. ""It could be the end of our civilization,"" he said, insisting that ""we must mobilize all our resources to end soon to war""."
2623	21	"Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Monday urged the WEF to broker a peace in Ukraine in the next two months before Russia is thrust into ""a permanent alliance with China"" that would destabilize Europe."
2623	23	"Russia has been an essential part of Europe for 400 years, noted the 98-year-old Kissinger, warning those seeking Moscow's ""defeat""."
26230	1	Zelensky: Let's prepare a million-strong army •
26230	3	Ukraine is assembling a million fighting forces equipped with Western weapons to recover the southern territories occupied by Russia. This was announced by Kiev Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in an interview with the Sunday Times. Claiming for the President Volodymyr Zelensky gave orders to develop plans for the liberation of coastal areas, which are considered vital for the country. “We understand that it is politically necessary. The president has instructed the high command to develop the plans, and the general staff will communicate what is needed,” Reznikov explained.
26230	5	Zelensky: Russians responsible for Donetsk attack will be punished
26230	7	"“A rocket attack on the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. All those who give orders for such raids, all those who carry them out targeting our cities, residential areas, kill absolutely deliberately. After such attacks, they will not be able to say that they did not know or did not understand. Retribution is inevitable for every Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone."" This was stated by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a video message on social media."
26231	1	Landings and infections: the scourge of illegal immigrants enters the new Covid emergency
26231	3	Taranto, 13 July - The arrival at the port of Taranto of the Geo Barents, a ship of the NGO Doctors Without Borders with 314 illegal immigrants on board, is scheduled for today. The announcement from the Italian authorities came after midnight yesterday as the boat was going back and forth in front of the Sicilian coast of Agrigento. The number of landings is increasing exponentially, and is ready to set new records, in the face of an absolutely helpless political class; ministers and ministries reduced to simple traffic dispatchers. You go here, you go there, and so on.
26231	5	That naval traffic that the NGOs themselves have fueled to excess, allowing the traffickers to increase their earnings – and those of those who then manage hospitalization and maintenance. We have spoken over and over again of the figures that revolve around the hospitality business, which it would be better to call the new slave trade, also in the context of all those projects, lavishly financed
26231	7	for integration. Operation, the latter, which appears at least unlikely. Just read the crime news of any newspaper from any part of Italy to understand it.
26231	9	Immigration at the time of the crisis and Covid
26231	11	Now the question arises spontaneously: but in an international context in which the energy crisis, the balance between super powers, the rigor that Draghi is ready to offer the nation to save on gas, electricity and water (due to another emergency, that of drought) how can Italy continue to take on hundreds of thousands of immigrants?
26231	13	"And to stay on the subject of an emergency, the umpteenth complaint about the management of illegal immigration at the time of Covid arrives from Trapani. The Trapani provincial secretariat of the union organization of the State Police ""Italia Celere"" yesterday issued a press release in which the inadequacy of the ""reception system"" is clearly written. Linked, above all, to the pandemic and the lack of concrete answers for the health security of police operators, civilians operating within the C.P.R. (Centri di Permanenza per i repatrii), despite the fact that reminders have been sent for a year."
26231	15	"“In recent weeks there have been transfers from Pantelleria to Trapani of subjects landed irregularly on the island, including many in a “self-surveillance regime” as they are “close contacts” of subjects who tested positive for Covid upon disembarkation. In particular, of all the transferees, 7 who were in the aforementioned condition, with self-surveillance expiring on 14 July 2022, were held at the C.P.R. Milo pending execution of the refoulement/expulsion order issued against them""."
26231	17	With the Covid landings in freedom
26231	19	"The press release continues: “The foreigner, F.M. of 49 years, landed in Pantelleria on 04 July, however, already subjected to the act of disembarkation with a quick swab for which he had tested negative, accused last Sunday of a feverish state, following which he was taken to the Emergency Room of the 'Sant'Antonio Abate Hospital in Trapani, where he tested positive for COVID-19. So far so good could be said, given that the 7 subjects were, and are, within a separate sector of the C.P.R., specifically set up to prevent potentially infected subjects from coming into contact with other foreigners already detained at the C.P.R. Of all the foreigners transferred in recent weeks, the number of subjects subjected to the Self-Surveillance regime is very high and the number of foreigners who, after having received notification of a Rejection Provision, having been unable to detain them at a C.P.R. national territory due to unavailability of places, they were recipients of an order from the Quaestor to leave the national territory within 7 days""."
26231	21	"And we could stop here already! But the press release goes further: “This O.S. fears the emergence of COVID outbreaks within the structures for 'asilants' and has strong doubts that the irregular recipients of the Order of the Quaestor, free to roam around Italy, observe the requirements to wear an FFP2 mask, indoors or in presence of gatherings, up to the tenth day following the date of the last close contact. In practice, thanks to the incorrect management of transfers from Pantelleria, potential triggered biological weapons have been put into circulation on the national territory, which we do not know where they will cause damage. It is evident to this Secretariat that something is not working in the methodology used in the management of illegal immigrants who arrive on our coasts, which transforms these subjects into time bombs for the health of the operators of the FF.PP., for the operators of the managing body of the C.P.R. , for foreigners themselves and for any citizen who, unaware, comes into contact with them""."
26231	23	"The trade union organization concludes: «Our O.S., however much it tries to be conciliatory and however much it tries to find a dialogue with the relevant institutions, cannot compromise on the protection of the health of men in uniform and this should also be a fundamental interest of the Prefecture and Police Headquarters. Our O.S. will pay close attention to the decisions taken in relation to the above, because hospitality cannot, nor should it, be an absolute priority over public health and the health of workers. The responsibility for certain erroneous choices weighs heavily on the lives of police officers and their families""."
26231	25	Italians in quarantine, free immigrants
26231	27	Did you all understand? Businesses, workers, the elderly, children all subjected to bans and restrictions for two and a half years and with the threat of starting again in September while there are those who roam free and without any obligation in our own cities. In order not to open another chapter: where does the data on positive, ill and dead from Covid of illegal immigrants who arrived in Italy end up? What statistics are they referring to? We posed the question to many Organizations and Authorities, but no answer... Who is hiding, and why?
26232	1	Meloni, Giuliani (former mayor of New York): she will be the Italian Margaret Thatcher.
26232	3	Rudolph - Rudy - Giuliani, former Republican mayor of New York, lawyer and conservative politician does not spare himself and demolishes the house of cards built on the Draghi government, explaining how the media which are intervening in these hours to discredit the party of patriots and conservatives of FdI, are only political instruments of censorship; other than authoritative media.
26232	5	"Giorgia Meloni will be the Italian Margaret Thatcher. Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is convinced of this. The conservative politician, famous for having implemented the doctrine of ""zero tolerance"" against crime in the Big Apple, interviewed the other day in a podcast on the Rumble platform, said he had no doubts."
26232	7	Meloni will have to seize the opportunity lost by Silvio Berlusconi and give Italy a government that puts an end to socialist methods and creates a free market economy in Italy capable of dragging it out of the swamp of crisis.
26232	9	And with regard to the economic crisis, Giuliani has not spared harsh criticism of that Mario Draghi who continues to be presented by the mainstream as the Lord's anointed. He is part of that club that ruined Europe says Giuliani.
26232	11	“The fact – he said is that Draghi was a failure, yes, he got a big bailout from the EU but in exchange for very severe economic reforms that he had to carry out in Italy.
26232	12	Well, those economic reforms have not been implemented and the Italian economy is among the worst of the European countries, in fact the concern is that it could drag the EU economy down.
26232	13	So I don't understand how Draghi can be considered a success, I mean he is a success like Biden is a success, in the minds of the European left. He belongs to that club, he is part of that club, and they ruined… that club ruined the economy of Europe, and Italy is one of the main victims.”
26232	14	And again Giuliani attacked the New York Times and those media that have started again – after the fall of the Draghi government – ​​to launch phantom accusations of fascism against the Brothers of Italy and Giorgia Meloni herself.
26232	15	"“Well, they, the way they cover the news dishonestly and hide things, they constantly violate the first amendment (US Constitution – freedom of speech ed.), this makes them more fascist than anyone they are writing, so I don't consider them serious at all, where they censored the hard drive news (by Hunter Biden ed) for 18 months and then, finally admitted it was true. I mean, is this really a newspaper? Or is it a fascist political movement that likes to trample on people's right of expression? Giorgia Meloni is what Italy needs and furthermore she is someone who believes in the free enterprise system that needs to be safeguarded in Italy, you know it is on the verge of collapse if it hasn't collapsed already …""."
26236	1	Malta rejects French NGO in Italian port: another 314 freeloaders on the way
26236	3	Foreign NGOs continue to attack Italy. Malta, when called into question, rejects them in Italy. And they stand in front of our ports.
26236	5	Since the start of the year:
26236	7	Foreign NGOs have dumped 10,500 illegal immigrants in Italy since the beginning of the year
26236	9	The costs should be passed on to the flag governments. And above all, the fucking illegal immigrants.
26236	11	"The NGOs pressing on our country with the latest claim to a safe haven, are launching yet another ultimatum off our coasts. Yesterday was the Ocean Viking, which on Wednesday brought 306 passengers on board to Pozzallo. Today it is the Geo Barents of Doctors Without Borders, which has already positioned itself about 14 miles from the limit of the Italian territorial waters near Augusta: one of the most popular ports of call and among the most generously donated as pos. And the one again claimed with a vehement protest that reads: ""A positive answer must be given now"", thundered by the NGO. In short, the complicated redistribution of the 2,000 migrants from Lampedusa to the other reception centers in our country does not stop traffickers and humanitarian organizations who, undaunted, continue to en route to our borders. To guard our coasts. And to demand one of our ports."
26236	13	Migrants, with our coasts collapsing, Geo Barents is pressing for the disembarkation of the 314 on board
26236	15	"While Malta, France, and in this case Norway – Geo Barents, specifically, flies the Norwegian flag – shrug. Knowing full well that the problem will fall upon us once again. Strengthened by the alibi, now tested, according to which Italy should ""only"" play the role of bridge country. Safe landing place, where migrants land and undergo medical triage, before being (possibly) transferred to Norway. Where, however, coincidentally, they never arrive. And where the 314 on board the Médecins Sans Frontières ship will not arrive this time either, after our authorities - who will have taken charge of them - will distribute them in the various reception centers of the Belpaese. With the Interior Ministry which, more usually, is silent and consents."
26236	17	In short, it is obvious that even for the 314 on board the Geo Barents the port of disembarkation will be an Italian port. Discounted. Implicit in the request that forces the tones. This story too, like all those that have preceded it to date, is the chronicle of an announced landing that recites the same script as always. So much so that by now the NGOs, as Il Giornale also underlines in these hours, «do not turn to other countries to request disembarkation, despite the fact that there are many bordering on the Mediterranean basin. Or rather - continues the Milanese newspaper - Geo Barents has made the request to Malta, knowing full well that the authorities of the island country will never respond to the request. So much so that it has decided to start pressing against the Italian borders, even if it is flying a foreign flag.
26245	1	Orban, 'EU changes strategy, West negotiates between Moscow and Kiev'
26245	3	"BRUSSELS - Hungarian premier Viktor Orban is once again speaking of the war in Ukraine and attacking the strategy implemented so far by Brussels. ""A new strategy is needed that does not focus on winning the war but on an adequate peace offer,"" Orban stressed according to his spokesman on twitter. The task of the West - he added - is not to side with someone, but to stand between the Russians and the Ukrainians: ""there will be no peace until there is a peace negotiation between Russia and the United States"". |"
26245	5	"The head of the Hungarian government spoke at the Tusványos Summer, in Romania. ""Europe should not aspire to a role in world politics until it is able to address foreign policy issues 'in its own backyard', Orban attacked, adding: 'the West is losing the battle over natural resources and raw materials prime"" and international politics is destroying the Russian-German energy axis"". ""Today - he pressed - the situation is that the Russians sell less energy but have much more income"", while ""the EU is losing because its energy deficit has tripled"". Then dwelling on the national challenges, the prime minister reiterated some of the key points that have been dividing Budapest from Brussels for months. “If we stay out of war, migration, gender madness, global minimum tax and economic downturn, Hungary will be able to maintain its success,” Orban explained"
26249	1	Ukrainian ports are back to work. Moscow: 'Russian exports restart'
26249	3	"Ukrainian ports ""go back to work"". This was stated by the Ukrainian Navy on the day when the center for the coordination of operations opens in Istanbul to allow the safe passage of Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea after the agreement between Kiev, Moscow and the UN with the mediation of Turkey. And this as Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko says the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukrainian grain exports to the Black Sea could come to naught ""if obstacles to Russia's agricultural exports are not promptly removed."" Interfax reports it. Rudenko says grain shipments from Ukraine will begin soon and hopes the deal will stand."
26249	5	"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in the evening: he will present a ""concrete proposal"" for the release of basketball champion Brittney Griner, detained in Russia since February, to Russian Foreign Minister Serghiei Lavrov in a phone call in the coming days. Blinken didn't go into detail ""for security reasons."" It is a ""substantial"" proposal, Blinken reiterated. It is probably a prisoner exchange as happened for the ex marine Trevor Reed."
26249	7	Meanwhile, after 62 years of operations in the country, Tetra Pak is leaving Russia and selling the production to a local reseller. According to the multinational that produces integrated systems for the treatment and packaging of food, it was the economic sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia, after the invasion of Ukraine, that made trade with Moscow impossible. “The cumulative effect of export restrictions to Russia has led to an unsustainable supply chain, leaving the company with no alternative but to leave the country,” writes Tetra Pak. The company was founded in Lund, a city in southern Sweden, in 1951 and today has a global market, among the leading companies in the food packaging sector. The TT agency reports that its operations in Russia last year registered a value of 430 million euros.
26249	9	In Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appoints Andriy Kostin, a lawmaker from his own party, as the country's next attorney general. This was reported by the Ukrinform agency. Zelensky presents a formal request to Parliament for the assembly to vote to confirm the appointment of Kostin who will replace Iryna Venediktova, who was ousted as attorney general earlier this month.
26249	11	"Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to Zelensky, claims responsibility for the attack on the main bridge of Kherson on twitter and calls on the Russians to leave the occupied city on which the Ukrainians have launched a counter-offensive. “Antonivsky bridge can be called an air defense device that intercepts all Ukrainian missiles, but there is no escaping reality: the occupiers should learn to swim across the Dnipro River. Or they should leave Kherson while it is still possible. There may not be a third caveat,"" he explains. Then Zelensky adds: 'Day after day, our defenders effectively strike enemy positions upsetting the plans of the occupiers. Himars and other precision weapons are turning the tide of war in our favor. And although the firepower of the Ukrainian army is inferior to that of the enemy, our warriors still strike with greater skill and precision' thanks to US-made missiles."
26249	13	"In fact, the fighting does not subside. Six people were injured in a Russian S-300 missile attack in Kharkiv this morning, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a Telegram post, Ukrinform reports. According to Terekhov, Novobavarskyi district also suffered an offensive: ""Fortunately, there were no casualties and there was no fire."" On the night of July 26, Russian troops shelled an area near the center of Kharkiv, Ukrainians say. ."
26251	1	"Russian gas, von der Leyen: ""EU prepare for new cuts"""
26251	3	"The announcement of the president of the European Commission: ""Emergency plan by mid-July"""
26251	5	"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calls on the EU to prepare for the eventuality that Russia ""completely"" cuts gas supplies. ""We must prepare for further problems in gas supplies, even for a complete cut by Russia - he said speaking in the plenary of the European Parliament in Strasbourg - overall today 12 member countries are directly affected by a total or partial reduction in deliveries of gas""."
26251	7	It is obvious: Vladimir Putin continues to use energy as a weapon. This is why the Commission is working on an emergency plan: we will present this plan and the necessary tools by mid-July. Member States have their national emergency plans already in place. This is good, but we need European coordination and joint action. We have to make sure that, in the event of major difficulties, the gas flows to where it is needed most. We must provide European solidarity. And we need to protect the single market and industrial value chains, he said.
26251	9	"Natural gas stocks in the EU ""were at 55% a week ago and now we should be above"" that threshold. The G7 has decided to work internationally to arrive at a ""potential mechanism"" that imposes a ceiling on the price of Russian oil. It will take ""a global approach, an alliance of many countries willing to put a ceiling on the price of Russian oil and it will be necessary to convince many countries that do not want to join the alliance so that they do not go around"" the ceiling."
26251	11	"This potential oil price cap could also be a good platform if we were to look at a gas price cap under special circumstances. ""We could activate, if needed, mechanisms such as a Sure plan"" of loans to finance the expenses necessary to face the energy crisis, but ""it is not part of the emergency plan"" that the Commission will present by mid-July."
26251	13	The president of the European Commission then compared the resistance of the Ukrainians to the Russian invasion to that of the Czechoslovakians against the Russian tanks sent, in August 1968, to repress the experiment of 'socialism with a human face' by the secretary of the Communist Party Czechoslovakian Alexander Dubcek.
26251	15	"The Ukrainians - said von der Leyen speaking in the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on the occasion of the launch of the Czech presidency of the EU Council - faced the Russian invasion without weapons. Citizens spoke to Russian soldiers, wrote to them, evoked the absurdity of this war in all public spheres. These are images that remind us of another invasion, another phase of opposition. It was in Prague in 1968: you will remember the demonstrations by Czechs, young and old, who opposed the Russian invasion in the streets of Prague. Therefore, ""I cannot imagine a better country than the Czech Republic to take over the presidency of the EU Council. We are in a fight for freedom, peace and self-determination"", he concludes."
26253	1	Turkish Defense Minister: Russia has nothing to do with the bombing of Odessa
26253	3	Kosovo postpones for a month the ban on the use of Serbian license plates and documents that led to the current escalation
26253	5	Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has issued some statements on the explosions in the city of Odessa, which the Kiev regime attributes to a missile attack by Russia.
26253	7	"In a statement collected by the correspondent of the Anadolu agency, Akar said that there was an explosion in Odessa this morning and in this regard he said: ""We received information that there had been a missile attack and on this we had a Telephone conversation with Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov and Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Aleksandr Kubrakov. We received the necessary information. They said that there had been a missile attack. They said that one of the missile attacks hit one of the silos, l 'other fell in an area near the silo, but the important thing is that there is no negativity in the loading capacity and capacity of the docks, and that activities in Odessa can continue""."
26253	9	"Then the Turkish minister reported that he got in touch with Russia: “Furthermore, in our contact with Russia, the Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and were looking into the matter very closely. and in detail. The fact that such an incident occurred immediately after the agreement we made yesterday regarding the shipment of grain really concerned us. However, we continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the agreement we reached yesterday and we have also expressed in our meetings that we are available to the parties to continue their cooperation calmly and patiently."""
26253	11	"Akar further added that the agreement will be implemented as soon as possible: “Already with the start of these talks, there has been a drop in prices as stated by the experts, that this should be continued and that it is very important in terms of humanity, in terms of meeting food needs, in terms of rescuing people waiting for grain. Our coordination with Ukraine will continue. We have fulfilled and will continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the memorandum of understanding we signed during yesterday's meeting. In this framework, we have multiplied our efforts since yesterday for the functioning of the Joint Coordination Center, as enshrined in the agreement. Including the UN representative, the representatives of Russia and Ukraine have now started working together with Turkey on joint coordination. It is our hope and wish that these and similar events are set aside quickly and these studies completed as soon as possible in line with the agreement we have reached. At present, we are following the incident closely and maintaining our contacts. It is our hope and wish that these works will continue as desired, as indicated in the agreement""."
26260	1	FOLLOWING PUTIN IS LEADING ORBAN TO THE ABYSS – ANGRY PROTEST AGAINST THE TAX REFORM IMPOSED BY ORBAN HAS BEEN GOING ON IN BUDAPEST FOR FIVE DAYS – SINCE HIS FOURTH RE-ELECTION, IT IS THE FIRST TIME THE HUNGARIAN PREMIER HAD TO FACE MASS PROTESTS – THE COST OF HIM DEARLY IS THE PRO-PUTIN LINE ON GAS AND OIL: THE ENERGY CRISIS HAS NOW FORCED HIM TO ELIMINATE SUBSIDIES FOR PROTECTED CATEGORIES. MEANWHILE INFLATION IS AT THE STARS…
26260	3	The first protests began last Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered on a bridge over the Danube, overlooked by the Országház, the sumptuous Gothic Parliament building. Protesters then blocked traffic in central Budapest for three hours. Yesterday, however, a few thousand Hungarians demonstrated against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the fifth consecutive day of protests.
26260	5	To bring the Magyars on the streets is a new law desired by the nationalist and conservative prime minister. The measure is intended to increase the tax burden for hundreds of thousands of traders and self-employed workers, say protesters who raised placards and shouted heavy slogans at the head of government.
26260	7	The protests mark an unexpected drop in popularity for Orbán, whose Hungarian Civic Union (Fidesz) won the legislative elections last April by a large margin. Many, especially in Europe, had hoped for the victory of Orbán's challenger, that Peter Marki-Zay who today is trying to ride the protests, taking the lead of a heterogeneous coalition of centrists, social democrats, ecologists and former right-wing extremists.
26260	9	Three months ago, however, the premier in power without interruption since 2010 was confirmed with a large 52% of the votes. Orbán had conducted yet another electoral campaign breaking with the European Union, demonstrating the unwillingness of a Hungary dependent on Russian hydrocarbons to break with Vladimir Putin's Russia.
26260	11	"Curiously, his government is now facing the strongest wave of protests precisely because of energy: the parliament controlled by Fidesz has made a clean sweep of the protected categories by establishing that those who consume more energy than the average will have to pay it at the market price and no longer on the basis state-subsidized rates. The intervention of the prime minister on Friday on the radio who defended the law as ""good and necessary"" was of little use."
26260	13	"Two days earlier the government had declared a ""state of energy emergency"", announcing greater use of coal and inviting families to moderate consumption. In late May, Orbán also blocked the EU's plans for a total and immediate embargo against Russian oil."
26260	15	However, the counter-current attitude of Budapest did not prevent a strong weakening of the forint on the eve of the conflict 367 were needed to buy one euro, today it takes 410. Associated with the increase in gas and oil on the global market, the decline in the national currency it has plunged Hungary into an inflationary crisis that is costing Orbán much popularity.
26260	17	According to the Központi Statisztikai Hivatal (the national statistical body), the inflation rate in Hungary rose to 11.7% annually in June, up sharply from 10.7% in May and 9.5% of April. In late January, the Hungarian government had imposed a ceiling on the prices of six food products (granulated sugar, wheat flour, sunflower oil, pork, chicken breast and milk) between February 1 and May 1, 2022.
26260	19	Announced by Orbán himself, the measure helped the premier win the elections.
26260	21	Surviving the economic shocks of a very close war Hungary and Ukraine are neighboring countries is a new challenge.
26261	1	The next alarms: hot autumn? Not very cold
26261	3	Warm autumn, or rather, very cold. In Italy the siren of various alarms rings out, which would seem distant and microscopic, but in reality they are concrete. Let's see them in detail to understand what is happening and to prevent them from continuing into the next season, otherwise let's get ready for a very cold, dark and expensive autumn.
26261	5	The most recent problem is represented by the government crisis.
26261	7	The 5 Star Movement did not vote to trust the government in the Aid Decree, which was nonetheless approved. Draghi then presented himself to the Council of Ministers, declaring his resignation, which was rejected by Mattarella.
26261	9	Two scenarios would be envisaged: if Draghi decided to leave his office, there would be a vote. A plausible but undesirable hypothesis, given that measures such as: cutting the price of petrol, bonuses for workers, PNRR objectives and others would follow.
26261	11	The other scenario would be to move forward, but without the 5 Stars. This would continue until the natural end of the legislature, 2023, so that the government will be able to continue working on the dossiers at risk.
26261	13	All of this is happening at a very difficult time: war on Europe's doorstep, skyrocketing inflation, for which an irresponsible and inappropriate attitude given the numerous and different crises afflicting Italy today.
26261	15	The energy crisis, driven by the sharp increase in gas costs, is above all caused by the war in Ukraine and the reduction in supplies from Moscow.
26261	17	The public transport sector would be severely affected, despite having an eye to the future. To support the sector, a funding plan was approved, deriving from the PNRR and national funds, up to 2033. The Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Giovannini, reiterated that investments for the future must focus on technological and digital innovation and environmental, social and economic sustainability, to succeed in the leap in quality.
26261	19	Moreover, it is also health care that is in pieces.
26261	21	"Italian hospitals would appear to be an emergency within an emergency due to various critical issues: lack of hospital staff, lack of beds, organizational difficulties, lack of funding. In addition, despite the Covid, in the emergency room for a simple ankle sprain the average waiting time is long, perhaps the name ""slow aid"" would be more appropriate. What is certain is that the pandemic has shown the weakness of the health sector and the current emergency room crisis is nothing more than the result and tip of the iceberg of a hospital system in trouble."
26261	23	A further national alarm is represented by the increase in torrid heat and the absence of rain, in fact after the drought there is a fire emergency.
26261	25	Italy burns with fires tripled in the past year compared to the historical average, more than one fire every two days since the beginning of 2022, in a summer that comes after a spring ranked as the sixth hottest ever on the planet. In these cases, prevention is a priority, as is the need to team up with the civil protection, with the municipalities and with the firefighters, who during the summer period intensify their shifts to promptly deal with this emergency.
26261	27	However, a decidedly hot summer is not expected just for the temperatures, but also for the prices of electricity and gas.
26261	29	The dramatic increase in electricity and natural gas tariffs is certainly not accidental, as it is mainly due to Russia's decisions to partially cut supplies to Germany and Italy. Consequently, it appears increasingly important and crucial that the affected countries find alternative sources from which to obtain supplies.
26261	31	Furthermore, the times in which the Draghi government had to take measures to limit the impact of the bills are numerous. For example, in the Dear Energy Decree of the end of June, the zeroing of system charges was confirmed for the third quarter of the current year, affected precisely by these new increases. Then the 200 euro bonus, to help employees, retirees and the unemployed. But the question is: will it be enough?
26261	33	Therefore, the economic framework - and not only that - of our country depends heavily on the evolution of the war in Ukraine.
26261	35	"The war would therefore be ""the great judge"" of the Italian situation."
26263	1	"Rome burns and the ""rubbish"" is rampant? Here is the showcase of Italy"
26263	3	Rome capital city? Yes, but of the Italian paradoxes. What is happening these days in the Eternal City is basically nothing exceptional: it is the faithful mirror of a country adrift. A country that suffocates from its ills that have never been cured and from the invincible compulsion to repeat the same mistakes.
26263	5	"The country suffocates in debt, just as Rome suffocates in the ""rubbish"" and in the smoke produced by the fires in the junkyards in the eastern quadrant of the city, fires set in all probability by organized crime. And yes, because the ""rubbish"" has always attracted various mafias, criminals and marauders. The suspicion of many is that the fires flare up just as there is talk of a waste-to-energy plant in the capital. As if to say: bosses and sub-bosses also intend to enter the business that is emerging. And they launch signals… incendiary."
26263	7	A perfect synchronism. As in the mysterious fire in the Malagrotta mega-landfill, which caused yet another waste emergency and for some time produced an even more mysterious disease among hundreds of operators of the AMA (the Rome waste disposal company) who marked visit. To then heal mysteriously, all together, in one night. And then they say that miracles don't exist.
26263	9	But what are Roman citizens ultimately complaining about? What is happening to them is ordinary “Italian” sadness. If the citizens of East Rome risk dioxin, what should the inhabitants of the area between Naples and Caserta say, where the soil is poisoned by highly toxic waste buried by the Camorra?
26263	11	"Italian evils, Roman evils. If Italy is in debt, Rome has long since sunk into ""buffi"" (as in Roman dialect debts are defined). After all, how do you maintain the large army of municipal employees? They are the beauty of 48,000, as much as a small Italian city. And let's not consider the immense army of workers in subcontracted services. A mass that grew, council after council, in the race for municipal benefits."
26263	13	Italian style, tremendously Italian. Like the habit of putting off problems instead of facing and solving them. It is not so much a matter of indolence as of the chronic incapacity of decision-makers to decide, squeezed as they are between clientele, power lobbies, ideological pressure groups.
26263	15	"Because, in the end, it is precisely these champions of particularism that the Romans have to thank for the rampant ""rubbish"" and the fires of the junkyards. Ideologism and bureaucratic obtuseness did not allow the problem of waste disposal to be resolved in the capital at the time of mayor Raggi, who aimed at separate collection instead of thinking about the waste-to-energy plant, which was, the latter, an effective solution, but not ecologically correct. And his contribution to the mess was also given by Nicola Zingaretti, who as president of the Lazio Region agreed with the mayor Virginia, approving a plan that did not include the waste incineration plant. Ecologists must be satisfied, because they constitute a pool of left-wing votes. Or not?"
26263	17	Waste sorting was a total failure. On the other hand, the ecologists-animalists have had their satisfaction, given that whole families of wild boars feast around the piles of garbage. Today Zingaretti is silent, because the mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri has in fact disavowed him, betting decisively on the waste-to-energy plant. A divergence in the Pd house, which demonstrates the lack of lucidity of the Roman political ruling class.
26263	19	"Now Gualtieri and all of Rome's political nomenklatura await the constitutional law which grants special powers, including regulatory autonomy, to the capital. They await her as sorcerer's apprentices await the magic wand. But we already know how it will end: the special powers will only serve to further squeeze the Roman taxpayers, who already pay the highest local taxes in Italy, only to find themselves then the ""rubbish"" on the streets and buses that occasionally go to fire."
26263	21	All in line with the Italian style, tremendously Italian.
26264	1	Iran nuclear talks fail: is another war on the horizon?
26264	3	Iran has been at the center of the international agenda for a few days.
26264	5	"The Tehran summit between Iranian President Raissi, Russian President Putin and Turkish President Erdogan on Syria, the war in Ukraine and more has just concluded. But the most burning issue concerns the now almost obvious failure of the negotiations for the restoration of the JCPOA, otherwise known as the ""Iranian nuclear agreement""."
26264	7	The agreement called for Iran to eliminate its medium-enriched uranium reserves, cut its low-enriched uranium reserves by 98% and reduce its gas-fired centrifuges by two-thirds for thirteen years, while for the next fifteen years the enrichment of uranium could not exceed 3.67%, in order to prevent Iran from acquiring atomic weapons.
26264	9	The agreement was signed by Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany in July 2015. The agreement was fiercely criticized by Israel and the US Jewish communities. Donald Trump, who succeeded Barack Obama as US president, then decreed the US exit from the agreement, restoring sanctions on Iran.
26264	11	Biden instead resumed negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Why did he do it? Simply because an Iran equipped with atomic weapons terribly scares not only Israel, but also the other Arab countries, allies of the USA.
26264	13	But the negotiations to restore the agreement immediately ended up on a dead end. The US would like to forever prevent Iran from possessing nuclear technology that would allow it to make an atomic bomb; at the same time they do not want to lift the sanctions on the country of the Ayatollahs. Without US sanctions, Iran would become a great power. On the other hand, the Iranian delegation was adamant on this position: first the US must eliminate the sanctions and then Iran will return to observe the provisions of the JCPOA, relating to uranium enrichment. None of the two sides, however, seems to withdraw from their positions.
26264	15	Therefore, given the now almost certain failure of the negotiations, Joe Biden has declared that he will prevent Iran from manufacturing an atomic bomb at all costs, even with war if necessary.
26264	17	Is the hypothesis of a US-Iran war realistic at this point? In such a conflict, if Russia and China do not intervene, the superiority of the US military over the Iranian one will be overwhelming. But Iran, with its recent missile advances, could raze Israel and US bases in the Middle East. This is well before the stars and stripes army can deploy a credible military force on the ground. Are the US willing to pay such a price?
26265	1	Strategika - The Beginning of the End for the Ukrainian Army?
26265	3	A certain warmongering and pro-NATO narrative insists in the mainstream media on Russia's possible defeat on the ground, as well as phantom counterattacks by Ukrainian forces.
26265	5	A functional narrative to continue sending weapons to the Kiev regime, despite the fact that these weapons will only have the effect of producing more destruction and unnecessary deaths, whether they are destroyed and captured by Russian forces or sold under the table by the Ukrainians themselves.
26265	7	Meanwhile, while the United States and Europe continue to chatter about a possible victory on the field, news of a very different tenor is coming from the battlefield.
26265	9	The French publication Strategika writes:
26265	11	"The beginning of the end for the Ukrainian military?
26265 13 After the double defeat in the Lysychansk - Severodonetsk sector and the loss of more than 10,000 men (killed, wounded, prisoners, missing) and the abandonment of 700 materials and heavy combat equipment, the bad news keeps piling up for the Kiev army with the continuation of the Russian and Allied offensive in the Donbass.
26265 15 Today we learn that in the Soledar sector, following the Russian air attacks, the 24th Mechanized Brigade amounts to 2,500 men, equal to 60% of the initial force committed. The 79th Airborne Assault Brigade saw its losses exceed 80% of its initial strength. Either way, these two brigades are no longer fit to fight as a formed unit.
26265 17 ...All these elements make it possible to consider the possibility of a collapse of the Ukrainian army in the Donbass in the next fifteen days. The blows inflicted by the Russians and their allies, less than 48 hours after the fall of Lysychansk, have left no respite for the fleeing units to gather their fugitives and rediscover a semblance of cohesion on their new lines of defense which, moreover, could now be taken in the rear in case of victory at Seversk and Krasnopolye in the Slaviansk sector."
26265	19	Russia continues to advance. Slowly but surely. Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) forces and Russian troops have entered the city of Seversk, which is under their operational control, TASS news agency said, citing a source close to the Lugansk People's Militia.
26265	21	"Allied forces have already entered Seversk (city in Donetsk People's Republic controlled by the Ukrainian army). I can tell that the city is under our operational control. Mopping-up operations are underway. Seversk will soon be completely liberated by Ukrainian troops.""
26265 23 The taking of Serversk was later confirmed by Vitaly Kiselev, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the LPR.
26265 25 Seversk is under our control, ”he told Channel One."
26265	27	The situation on the ground is increasingly difficult for Ukraine but the Kiev regime persists in not wanting to start any negotiations.
26265	29	"According to the spokeswoman of the Moscow Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, ""this is not the position of the Ukrainian state, but a song sung by Washington, which the Kiev regime has agreed to perform."""
26284	1	The Left of Terror: the race of alarmist headlines against the right to instill fear in voters
26284	3	For years they have accused Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of riding the fears of the Italians. Were they asking for more security? “You don't do politics on fear,” they objected. Were they asking for more immigration controls? “One does not speculate on the fear of being different”, they replied.
26284	5	Yet now, looking at certain headlines, seeing certain expressions on TV, reading certain editorials and certain services, it seems that the progressive front is united by a single goal: to use the language of fear to alarm voters, to give them the feeling that the apocalypse is near, that catastrophe is around the corner. All immersed in a single terrifying color: black.
26284	7	"Repubblica evokes ""the phalanx"", the Spanish fascist party"
26284	9	"Let's see some examples. Republic, more usually, stands out. It opens with a photo of Giorgia Meloni at the recent programmatic conference in Milan and with the title: La falange (name of the Spanish fascist party). But that's not enough. It is joined by a commentary by Furio Colombo entitled ""Promises from a black face"". An article that closes under the banner of boundless pessimism: ""It's not a good moment in Italian history"". Then Berizzi spreads about Giorgia Meloni's allies in Europe and the way Steve Bannon labeled her: ""Fascist post-fascist"". And yet there is an investigation into the ""black fiefdom"" of Latina which would be the model to which FdI looks. Here, Repubblica points out, Meloni chose his constituency ""armored by an ideological loyalty that has never been broken since December 18, 1932, when Benito Mussolini announced the birth of Littoria""."
26284	11	"""Tomorrow"" warns of Giorgia's ""march""."
26284	13	"De Benedetti's newspaper, Domani, summarizes the success of the Meloni line at the top of the center-right as follows: ""The march on Palazzo Chigi"". Where the term march is connotative and denotative. That's all. And I spig everything from the perspective of the demonizing narrative that the left is using. Then there are two pages on Guido Crosetto's “all affairs”. ""Felissimo"" by Giorgia - notes the newspaper - and that he could be chosen as prime minister of mediation. So he presents himself as shady and ambiguous because he cannot be called a ""fascist""..."
26284	15	Paul Krugman's grim predictions
26284	17	"Finally, in La Stampa we find the editorial by the economist Paul Krugman who prophesies gloomy crisis scenarios for Italy which risks sinking due to the rise of the ""anti-democratic forces"". And thank goodness that a few pages earlier Marcello Sorgi had warned: “Although Meloni is already targeted by journalistic revelations about her post-fascist past, it does not seem that they will be able to stop her progress. Indeed, among communication experts, there are those who say that they could favor it, mobilizing in their closest electorate the reaction to a sort of sense of persecution"". A warning so far not picked up on the left…"
26285	1	The UN asks Kiev, Moscow, the US and the EU to respect the agreements on Russian and Ukrainian wheat
26285	3	"After yesterday's aut aut with which Moscow warned that the agreement on the export of Ukrainian wheat could fail if the EU, the USA and Ukraine did not enforce the agreement which simultaneously concerned the export of wheat and Russian fertilizers blocked by sanctions, now the UN comes into play with the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres. Who, applauding the inauguration of the Istanbul Coordination Center for the export of grain from Ukraine - it is one of the formal and substantial aspects of the agreement signed in Istanbul - asks the parties to work to ""effectively apply"" the agreement with the goal of “reducing global food insecurity”."
26285	5	Yesterday Moscow lamented the fact that the double agreement signed in Turkey was not then fulfilled at the point in which the EU and the US should have relaxed the sanctions to allow, as had been decided, Russia to export grain and fertilizers, the latter being fundamental, among other things, for Italian agriculture.
26285	7	"""The secretary-general warmly welcomes the official inauguration of the Joint Coordination Center (JCC) in Istanbul,"" said Guterres' deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Which he underlined as this body ""is made up of representatives of Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the UN""."
26285	9	"""The work of the JCC - added Haq - will allow the safe transport, by merchant ships, of grain, related foods and fertilizers from three main Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea to the rest of the world. This will help respond effectively and prevent the rise of global food insecurity."""
26285	11	“Along with the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between Russia and the UN Secretary-General to promote access of Russian food and fertilizer products to global markets,” Haq said. – The JCC will help restore confidence in the global food market and bring food prices down from current levels.”
26285	13	"Finally, Haq said Guterres ""is grateful to Turkey for providing the parties and the United Nations with a platform to help operationalize the Black Sea Grains Initiative."" And he thanked ""Russia and Ukraine for quickly appointing and sending their representatives to Istanbul""."
26285	15	Now, however, the point is to enforce both parts of the agreement, both the one concerning Ukrainian grain and the one concerning Russian grain and fertilizers.
26296	1	Coal and uranium Thus Putin's gas war is changing the German political balance
26296	3	Faced with the need to find new sources, the Greens and the SPD must be ready to take initiatives that contradict their programmes, such as prolonging the shutdown of nuclear power plants. It is on energy that consensus is now being built and Scholz, posing in front of the (repaired) turbine of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, understood this
26296	5	On Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had his photo taken in front of one of the turbines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, currently stored at the Siemens Energy headquarters in Mülheim an der Ruhr. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the pipeline has been at the center of controversy: German (and European) dependence on Russian gas is one of the main weapons of blackmail in the hands of the Kremlin to discourage the German and EU response to the invasion.
26296	7	Before the conflict, 45% of Germany's gas imports came from Russia. It is a fundamental source of energy for the country's needs, both for its industrial production and in the context of the Energiewende, the energy turnaround which plans to gradually abandon nuclear and fossil sources to invest in renewable ones, with gas as an intermediate measure crucial in this process. Following the Russian invasion, Germany joined the European sanctions, also blocking the activation of Nord Stream 2, the doubling of the already existing gas pipeline that has been much debated at European and global level for years. The work was now completed, but the Scholz government prevented it from being put into operation. Berlin has also diversified its gas supplies: the share of that coming from Russia has been reduced to 35%, but it is unlikely to be able to do without it completely before 2024.
26296	9	With the prolongation and intensification of the sanctions, in recent weeks Moscow has unilaterally decreased the flow of gas to Europe: currently supply volumes are around 40% of pre-conflict levels. To justify the reduction, the Kremlin spoke of technical problems with the pipeline's turbines. One of these was flown to Canada for repairs, but was then detained due to sanctions. Robert Habeck, German Minister of Economy and Climate Protection, has asked Canada to send the turbine to Germany, in order to then be able to ship it in turn to Russia. But at that point, Moscow raised bureaucratic problems for the shipment.
26296	11	"Scholz, therefore, last Wednesday posed in front of the turbine, declaring to the press that ""the turbine works"" and that ""everything is quite clear and simple: the turbine is there, and it can be delivered, but someone has to say clearly that they want it"" . A clear reference to Moscow. Scholz's move is part of the widespread skepticism at European level about the Russian version regarding the interruption of the service, but it also responds to deeply felt needs from Germany. Precisely because of its energy dependence on Russia, in fact, the government has had to take emergency decisions, which in several cases also contradict the direction that the government had announced it would take in the phase of its establishment."
26296	13	This has concerned, in particular, the two main government forces: the Social Democrats, who represent the Chancellor, and the Greens, who have two key ministries in this phase, that of the Economy, in the hands of Robert Habeck, and that of Foreign Affairs, led by Annalena Baerbock. If the delays in sending arms to Ukraine have caused various criticisms of Scholz and the SPD, on the energy front, as it is easy to imagine, it is the Grüne who are under observation: for gas supplies, for example, Germany has discussed with Qatar (to which the Greens have long harbored skepticism).
26296	15	Furthermore, in June, Habeck launched a plan to restart some coal-fired plants to make up for the reduced gas supplies. The decision, obviously, is the result of contingencies, but it is singular that a green minister finds himself having to take it, especially if we consider that his party has been central in anticipating the exit from this fossil source, moving it from 2040 to 2030 .
26296	17	Furthermore, yesterday Scholz declared that Germany could consider prolonging the activity of nuclear power plants. Currently, in fact, the country is in the terminal phase of a long and gradual process of giving up nuclear energy (one of the main political battles of the Greens). According to plans, 2022 should be the last year of activity of the only three nuclear power plants still in operation, but in the past there have been speculations to extend their activity and postpone the definitive shutdown.
26296	19	However useful, the measure, if validated, could still largely respond to the need to give a signal to both Russia and German public opinion, beyond its actual usefulness. There are, in fact, a number of elements to consider.
26296	21	The three active plants, for example, produce 6% of the energy used in Germany (against the 25% generated by seventeen active reactors before the nuclear withdrawal plan): certainly not an irrelevant share, but not a decisive one either. Furthermore, prolonging the activity of the plants would mean producing less energy than expected, according to a government report dating back to March: when the activity of a reactor slowly begins to end due to the lack of unused uranium at the end of its useful life, the Production can be artificially extended for a few months by plant control measures, but at the cost of lower efficiency. For this reason, the report advised against an extension of the periods of activity.
26296	23	Similarly, a real suspension of the nuclear exit plan would be complex not only due to the technical and bureaucratic times that this would require, but also due to the fact that the uranium supply could still lead Berlin to look to Moscow. Furthermore, Scholz's declaration could also respond to the logic of showing himself pragmatic and reactive at a time when he and his party are falling in the approval polls, and are suffering greatly from the growth of the CDU and the high appreciation for Habeck and Baerbock, who have always been opposed to an extension on nuclear power and have only recently become more optimistic.
26296	25	In fact, public opinion seems to be in favor of the measure: at the end of June, 61% of respondents to a survey by Infratest Dimap believed it was right to continue the activity of the plants still operational beyond 2022. According to a Forsa survey of the past few days, today the percentage would have risen to 75%. A fairly distributed judgment among the various electorates, and which concerned more than one person out of two, even among those who voted Green in the last elections.
26296	27	The energy issue, therefore, is central not only for the German economy and for European freedom of action vis-à-vis Moscow, but is increasingly a topic for building political consensus in Germany. How long this phase will last will depend on a series of factors (first of all, the duration of the conflict), but in this scenario, the Greens and the SPD must demonstrate that they are ready for choices that are potentially in contradiction with the government programme, and motivated by the situation created by the invasion of Ukraine.
26300	1	"""Let's save the planet together"": all we needed was the sermon-book by Greta and the Dalai Lama"
26300	3	Rome, July 27 - There is little to do: in this period, environmentalism is on the rise. And it makes a lot of money. That the Greta Thunberg operation is a purely commercial operation is no mystery to anyone. After a couple of years of apnea, between a pandemic and a Russo-Ukrainian war, the iron must be struck now that it's hot again. In fact, the book Together to save the planet: common objectives against climate change, published by Baldini and Castoldi, has just arrived in bookstores. A volume signed by a very strange couple: Greta and the Dalai Lama.
26300	5	Greta and Dalai Lama together
26300	6	Of course, the book is not important, but who wrote it: those who are in fact two influencers. And I'm really sorry to say it, since we're still talking about a spiritual guide (the Dalai Lama, not Greta). As for the contents, the themes are the usual ones of the green arsenal: to safeguard the planet, man must take a step back. In fact, maybe he should just go extinct. The cipher of the volume, in fact, lies precisely in its misanthropic philosophy: at the basis of this philosophy, wrote Francesco Borgonovo on Truth, «there is, deep down, contempt for the human being. The body is nothing but a prison from which to detach as soon as possible, bliss lies in the dissolution of the individual, enlightenment comes only when the detachment from the corruption of reality is completed. In this context, it is not surprising that the most radical environmentalists come to consider man a cancer and to propagandize its extinction, to desire its annihilation and reduction to an organic compound, to garbage (read the texts of the cyberfeminist Donna Haraway for yourself). ».
26300	8	The big manger
26300	9	But there is not only this. It is no coincidence that the book - together with an intervention by Greta herself in the press - has just come out in these days. From 25 to 29 July, in fact, the Climate social camp is taking place in Turin, a European summit of all environmentalists from Greta. The event, of course, is organized on behalf of Thunberg's trademark Fridays for future. And - no less importantly - it received a massive contribution from Askatasuna, a notorious Turin social center linked to the violent No Tav and suspected of subversive activity. Misanthropes, enlightened and companions: a really nice picture for a commercial operation disguised as a splash of green paint.
2631	1	The government places more than 22,000 Ukrainians in Italian schools
2631	3	This demonstrates a total lack of interest in the welfare of Italian children. They always serve the interests of others.
2631	5	Imagine what they can learn, stuck in the schools of a foreign country and the damage they involuntarily do to Italian students.
2631	7	Crazy stuff. We have nothing against Ukrainian children, but obviously they don't even know Italian. What's the point of putting them in schools? To delay the already poor learning of our pupils? And since they come from no vax families, aren't they a problem?
2631	9	From 24 February to today, the Ukrainian students welcomed by the school system are 22,788, of which 5,060 in kindergarten, where there are no places for Italian children, so much so that parents are forced to pay ever higher fees in private schools, 10,399 in elementary school, 5,226 in middle school and 2,103 in high school.
2631	11	The delirious report also contains information on territorial distribution: 21% is concentrated in Lombardy, 12% in Emilia-Romagna and 11% in Campania. This was announced by the Ministry of Non-Education.
2632	1	Migrants, the silent invasion: another 573 landed in Augusta. But Lamorgese doesn't lift a finger
2632	3	The landing of migrants on one of our coasts is a certainty. While the political agreement on the automatic relocation of non-EU citizens recovered along the central Mediterranean route remains a promise. An unattainable mirage faded once again off the coast of Augusta, where the welcome machine, necessarily oiled properly, is continuously in operation. And where, since Monday night, the work of the doctors of the Order of Malta's Italian Aid Corps (Cisom) has not stopped. Intervened together with the Coast Guard in the rescue operations of 573 migrants, including 19 accompanied minors, who were on board two fishing boats 70 miles off Capo Spartivento. Among them also a body.
2632	4	Migrants, this year's landings bulletin is already a record
2632	6	"With them, therefore, the landings bulletin is updated: and as Il Giornale reported in the last few hours, more than four thousand migrants have already landed on the Italian coasts this year. To be exact, ""the illegal immigrants landed essentially in Sicily are: 4701. 3035 in January and 1666 in February"". And precisely, the last rescue operation took place off the Calabrian coast of Capo Spartivento. Where the Diociotti recovered the 573 passengers who, the Coast Guard explained, were in difficulty. “Aboard two overloaded fishing boats. And left at the mercy of the waves», which after being rescued, then landed in Augusta. If we then think that not far from Augusta, exactly in Pozzallo, just a few days ago 338 migrants disembarked from the Ocean Viking, 35 of whom tested positive for Covid and embarked on the Azure quarantine ship at anchor, it is clear how the totals increase and herald the impressive numbers that will materialize with the profusion of landings recorded every summer season, pandemic or not, indifferently…"
2632	8	Migrants, 572 on the ship Diciotti land in Augusta
2632	10	"And so, the Diciotti naval unit also found its berth on the quay of the port of Augusta. Where recognition operations are underway, waiting for the suitable structure to be identified that can host them. Cisom doctors continue to monitor the health conditions of children. Women. Men in trouble. By assuring them of medical care and assistance of all kinds, ""to try to meet basic needs, keeping them warm with the distribution of woolen blankets"", explained by Cisom. In addition to collaborating with ground medical personnel in anti-Covid activities. and all, declined on dizzying numbers. And multiplied by an exponentially increasing number of arrivals."
2632	11	"Meloni: «It is an emergency of illegal immigration. Lamorgese must resign as soon as possible"""
2632	13	"Numbers and difficulties that the government's migration policy, the indifference of the EU, and the inertia of Minister Lamorgese, not only do not stem. But, even, they let it grow dramatically. Parallel to a continuous state of emergency, from time to time buffered here and there, but never decisive. A stalemate that increases criticality and indignation, about which Matteo Salvini thundered again in the last few days: «Another 573 illegal immigrants are arriving. In addition to the more than 4,000 since the beginning of the year. I'm going to trial because I stopped the landings. The current minister does not lift a finger. Because?"". And on which Giorgia Meloni underlined from the opposition: «Daily landings: it is now an emergency for illegal immigration. Nothing will change with Minister Lamorgese at the Interior Ministry. He must resign as soon as possible ». But even on that front, from the Ministry of the Interior everything is silent and nothing is moving…"
2633	1	Greta Thunberg? They put it in mothballs. Guess why…
2633	3	Media power creates, media power destroys. For a while she turns the spotlight on you, after a while she turns it off. And disappear from the scene. At least for some time, waiting for your moment of glory to come back (if it is ever set to come back). This is what is happening to Greta Thunberg. She disappeared from the radar. She doesn't talk anymore and she doesn't talk about it anymore. She doesn't come out anymore. She no longer launches proclamations. What happened?
2633	5	It happened, put brutally, that it is no longer functional to the great global power, the one that had decided until recently to invest massively in the green conversion of the industrial apparatus, on zero emissions, on stopping global warming. And, for this reason, he had decided to spread a new ecological apocalyptic, complete with warnings about impending disasters, such as the rise in sea levels, the melting of the Arctic ice, the desertification of the southern hemisphere.
2633	7	The prophetess of this new ecological verb was precisely the small and resolute Greta. Every invective of hers was followed by millions and millions of followers, by direct streemings, by headlines on the front page and sumptuous services on the news.
2633	9	But now that's not the case anymore. The war in Ukraine has sharply changed interests and priorities. The West has suddenly awakened from the dream of a world without fossil fuels, a world of white mills and smiling cows. Gas and oil will be needed for years to come.
2633	11	So much so that Germany, the leader of the green transition with the Greens in government, has decided to suspend the closure of coal plants. Who cares about the greenhouse effect if Western European society and industry can save something on gas imports as well as secure the energy stocks necessary to sustain GDP and living standards. When economic interests are at stake, the Germans, as we know, don't look anyone in the face.
2633	13	The world ecological circles are not standing by and are sounding the alarm. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, expressed their concern in recent days: «The consequences of the Russian war in Ukraine not only risk destroying global food and energy markets, but could also undermine the global climate agenda . If countries respond to Russia's aggression by increasing their use of fossil fuels, the conflict risks taking us away from achieving global climate goals.
2633	15	"The Apocalypse can wait and Greta Thunberg risks remaining in mothballs for a long time. When her turn comes again, she will be an adult woman, with the ecologism of the ""gretini"" who will have lost her adolescence. And innocence."
2636	1	Sanctions on the oligarchs, Patriarch Kirill urges the faithful to pray for his wallet
2636	3	"Hours of anguish for Patriarch Kirill. In his Sunday sermon in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior and Invader, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church urged the faithful to pray for him, for non-gay Russians but above all for his wallet. «In these difficult times – said the primate – we are witnessing an expansion of NATO towards my bank accounts which threatens my assets estimated at between 4 and 8 billion euros. But God will punish them. And by God, of course, I mean Putin."""
2636	5	"The Russian archbishop then continued, recalling during his sermon the passage from Luke 8:25, ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an oligarch to enter the kingdom of God."" “The Lord's message is clear and assertive: God admonishes us because the eyes of our needles are too narrow. So let's broaden our needles and in general all the tools used for sewing! There are innumerable types of needle, of different sizes and shapes, in relation to the use and thickness of the material to be sewn but God speaks to each of them so that each one surrenders to the Gospel message and enlarges its eye, thus ending to the suffering of the rich! Otherwise, how will the oligarch enter the kingdom of God?? He'll have to shrink himself by miniaturizing beam or with Pym Particles – and of course he can afford it because he's rich – but it's a stress. Let's fight stress, the enemy that comes from the West!»."
2636	7	After this homily, delivered with balled eyes, Kirill invited the faithful to donate generously in church offering boxes, regardless of the fact that the box itself is solid gold.
2636	8	Cyril I made his fortune in the 2000s, when he was head of foreign affairs of the Moscow Patriarchate and Iraq was under a US embargo. At the time, Russia was supporting Iraq by sending basic necessities: the cigarette trade had been entrusted to the Russian Church, which took the tithe and sometimes let in cartons of cigarettes hiding them in the hat of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia.
2636	10	"Kirill praised the holy war against ""the gay lobby"" and Westerners who corrupt Russian customs, blessing the invasion of Ukraine and nuclear missiles. Following his positions, Europe is considering imposing its dreadful sanctions on him too and carrying out targeted actions with a significant impact, for example by sabotaging the waxing of the parquet of his chalet in the canton of Zurich. Even Ukraine is thinking of hitting the Patriarch, withdrawing the decoration of the Order of Jaroslav the Wise of the I Class, conferred on him in 2013, with the motivation ""If you think about it, he is not so wise""."
2636	12	According to Metropolitan Hilarion, while waiting for the pleas of the devotees to come true, Kirill would in any case already be working to run for cover, and to replenish his accounts he would have organized a theatrical tour that will stop in the main Russian theaters including the bombed Mariupol , titled “Orsini is right” and financed by a newspaper of the always free Russian press, “ежедневный сумасшедший” (“Il Matto Quotidiano”).
2640	1	Calenda wants Hungary out of the EU. But there you govern who wins, not who loses (like the Democratic Party with us)
2640	3	"Good first. Yes, we definitely liked Carlo Calenda better who yesterday lambasted Letta for the novice zeal with which he had invoked the immediate embargo on Russian gas. «Bravo Enrico, what do you replace it with?», he had joked. Strange to believe, but today it is the leader of Action who stumbles in the same ardor as the secretary of the Democratic Party in commenting on Giorgia Meloni's satisfaction (""exactly like Putin"", he insinuated in tweet) for the victory of Viktor Orban. And again: «Today Hungary is the fifth column of the Russians, a destination for Italian relocations, financed by European funds which we also pay. We really don't understand what we are waiting for to send them out of the EU"". Eh, how it runs. And then those tones of the master of the ironworks that refer to that corporate vision of politics so popular in the 90s, to which only Berlusconi was able to transplant a popular heart."
2640	4	Calenda against Orban and Meloni
2640	6	"It is impossible to expect it even from Carletto. He is a leftist from Pario who sneaked into politics through Luca Cordero di Montezemolo's ""Italia Futura"", someone who claimed to ride the anti-Casta vulgate agitated by Corriere della Sera with a surname longer than a freight train. Certainly more suited to a career diplomat than a descamisado leader. He noticed it on his own after a dispute in Naples that sent him the pizza sideways: Casta was also him. Hopelessly. It is no coincidence that he was a contra like Beppe Grillo who picked the fruits of the tree shaken from the book by Gian Antonio Stella and Sergio Rizzo. A bitter epilogue, never really archived by Calenda, however quick to recycle himself first as a minister of Renzi (now hated), then as an MEP of the Democratic Party (subsequently repudiated) and finally, in Action, as an apostle of competence."
2640	8	In Italy, elections are now optional
2640	10	If it were just that, it would be perfect. Unfortunately he has stubbornly stuck with politics, which is not exactly his calling. He proved this to the administrative offices of Rome, when faced with a center-right in the jaws he feared its contamination, precluding himself from a possible victory. But anyhow: from that world he wants the votes for free. Indeed, the closer the elections get, the more he burrows to the left, except for firing a few blanks against the 5Stelle, with whom (we bet?) He will soon go to ally. The anti-Meloni sortie is in the script. Like the one against Orban, whom he wants to oust from Europe. Without reflecting that the illiberal Hungarian premier governs by winning the elections, not losing them like the comrades of the Democratic Party. Perhaps, a party to be thrown out of the EU by the super-democratic Calenda would find him more by looking around than by looking for him on the globe.
2642	1	Draghi's reasoned risk: over 50,000 dead since he's been prime minister
2642	3	You can think of it as you like. The numbers tell a clear story: Draghi has failed. His health and vaccination policy has failed.
2642	5	On February 13, 2021 Draghi took over the reins of government with 13,908 coronavirus positives. The positivity rate was at 4.5%. While that day the victims had been 316.
2642	7	There were 2,095 people hospitalized in intensive care, down. Inpatients with symptoms instead 18,736, down.
2642	9	Today, after almost a year of Draghi treatment, the situation has turned upside down. We have almost 400 deaths a day. And we have 19,862 people hospitalized.
2642	11	The only slightly downward figure, around 1,700, is that of intensive care: but we know how it empties them, with the dead.
2642	12	How many since he has dealt with it with mandatory vaccines, green passes and the 'reasoned risk' policy?
2642	14	On February 13, there were 93,356 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. With today's deaths we have reached 143,875: Draghi's policy is responsible for 50,519 deaths.
2642	16	This villainous son of Goldman has caused almost more deaths than the previous government which, it is clear, found itself in a sudden situation.
2642	18	On the other hand, it doubled its landings last year and started 2022 off to a great start.
2642	20	He has to account for it. Yours is a government with a criminal migration and health policy.
2643	1	Revanchist Nazism throughout the Western world
2643	3	We are seeing the return of Nazism, but this time throughout the Western world. Austria, Germany and Italy eliminated civil liberties more completely than did Hitler and Mussolini. Re-Nazified Germany, Austria and Italy destroyed the doctor-patient relationship more completely than Josef Mengele did. The political leaders of this resurrected Nazism are all guilty of crimes under the Nuremberg Laws.
2643	5	Will the US, UK, France and Russia invade these Nazi countries again and execute the leaders for their capital crimes? No. The US, UK, France and Russia [1] are doing the same thing, as are Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
2643	7	Australia has concentration camps, not for Japanese prisoners of war but for Australian citizens suspected of having had contact with someone infected with Covid. Everywhere in the “free” Western world, executive branch officials have shown contempt for constitutional processes by asserting legislative powers and enacting laws in the form of mandates. Parliaments and Congresses have shown their contempt for democratic political systems by accepting the confiscation of their powers and the incorporation of the legislative function into the executive as happened in Rome under the Caesars.
2643	9	In the United States, little Nazis have popped up everywhere. Corporate employers, school boards, university administrators, sports team owners, hospital administrators, mayors and governors have turned out to be so many little Fuhrers issuing illegal orders: Inject yourself and your children with a substance that has been shown not to protect you or anyone else against Covid or any of its variants, but is known to carry a high risk of serious injury and death, or you will be fired and your career over. In re-Nazified Germany/Austria people are threatened with prison if they refuse to play Russian roulette with their health. What government in past history has been so tyrannical? The West has reached the supreme tyranny: your health does not depend on you and your doctor. Your health is controlled by a protocol handed down by a captive regulatory agency that only serves the profits of Big Pharma.
2643	11	The internal passports of the Soviet Union were seen as evidence of an unfree people. Now the entire Western “free” world is faced with internal passports called Covid passports. Once these passports exist, every human right, every civil liberty converts from a right to a privilege subject to government approval. All rights end. Passports are issued to compliant citizens who, thanks to their servitude, gain privileges to go to restaurants, bars, sporting events and other forms of entertainment, to travel and to keep their jobs.
2643	13	It is no longer the government that is accountable to the citizens; are the citizens accountable to the government.
2643	15	Freedom is thus redefined as slavery as in George Orwell's dystopia, 1984.
2643	17	In the United States the only people who have died of Covid have been people with weakened immune systems due to comorbidities who have been refused treatment with safe drugs known as Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin which also act as preventatives. To avoid Covid deaths, all that was needed was to protect the most vulnerable with preemptive doses of hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin.
2643	19	"Instead, people infected with Covid were buried in nursing homes filled with elderly people with immune problems. No one was treated, because the emergency use authorization given to the so-called ""vaccine"" provided that there were no known cures. So Big Pharma and the captured regulatory agencies — FDA, NIH, CDC, WHO — campaigned against hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Both were said to be dangerous and unapproved (a double lie). False claims were published by the whores of the press that hospitals were full of people sick with ivermectin, allegedly a drug for horses. Hospital administrators accepted the protocol handed to them by Fauci and Big Pharma that hospitals must prevent any treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin regardless of doctor's orders. The utterly corrupt American Medical Association has accepted this violation of the doctor/patient relationship."
2643	21	When word got out that American hospitals were being paid to kill infected patients, not treat them, family members had to go to the judiciary for a court order to force the hospital's murderous administrators to allow the doctor of a patient to save his life with ivermectin!
2643	23	The question desperately begging to be investigated and answered is: who, what agency, under what authority, with what appropriate money established the incentives for American hospitals to kill people to increase their revenues?
2643	25	This is the greatest crime in American history. Persons responsible for this should be arrested, tried, convicted and executed. Each of them is guilty of mass murder.
2643	27	"But nothing will happen, because the media will not allow any truth to be reported about the Covid deception. Believe it or not, the American media is more compliant as a propaganda ministry than the media was under Stalin in the Soviet Union. In Soviet times the media developed the ""technique of writing"" so that the reader read between the lines. But in ""free"" America where the press is protected by the First Amendment, the decision was made that revenue was more important to the media's existence than the truth. Thus, US press, TV and NPR media became agents for those who provided them with advertising revenue or under the table profits."
2643	29	Once again here are the Covid mortality and survival rates by age group of the untreated Covid infected. The left column is the death rate by age, the right column is the survival rate by age. Remember, the people who died were, on Fauci's orders, prohibited from treatment with the well-known life-saving drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
2643	31	Clearly, this is not a dangerous pandemic and certainly not one that requires the permanent destruction of accountable governance achieved over the centuries. Fauci and his evil race have returned the entire Western world to the era of slaves and serfs, in which no one can speak except the ruler.
2643	33	"Facing the fact that the destruction of Western freedom was accomplished by a handful of cheap totalitarian punks like Fauci, not tyrants of stature like Stalin and Hitler, reveals how empty the West has become to an educational ""system"" which for decades has questioned every Western conquest and every Western value. Public schools and universities, along with media whores and Hollywood, prepare the American people for the loss of their freedom."
2643	35	"Think about it. How many relatives and former friends do you have who, if you are not ""vaccinated"", will have nothing to do with you, who tell you that you are selfish and don't care about others, that you risk exposing others to death and harm for not be vaccinated. This is the narrative of Big Pharma and your former friends and relatives believe Big Pharma's selfish and profitable lies and are instead immune to known and published facts with which you unsuccessfully attempt to inform them."
2643	37	People who are unable to think for themselves – the majority of the population – are easily brainwashed and indoctrinated. It is not a population that can defend its freedom or impose responsible government. It's a shit population that turns against those who would restore her freedom, not against those who deprive her of her freedom.
2643	39	However, those brave few — frontier doctors, Covid ethics doctors, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and thousands of independent physicians and scientists (the ones who haven't received grants from Big Pharma) — who stand up for freedom do because it is freedom they are defending. They are defending a human enterprise – the work of a few people – that took centuries from Alfred the Great in the 9th century to the Glorious Revolution in 1680. The fact that young people today have never heard of Alfred the Great or the Glorious Revolution demonstrates how education has completely erased the achievements of Western history. America, indeed the entire Western world, no longer has a population enculturated in Western values.
2643	41	It was this human achievement – ​​responsible government – ​​that the Founding Fathers of the United States responded to with the demands of the Declaration of Independence and the protections of the United States Constitution.
2643	43	"The discrediting of these founding documents has been the primary function of American education for decades. Today we see the result: the American people, and also those of the Western world, have sold their freedom for a ""vaccine"" that harms health and kills, but does not protect against Covid."
2645	1	EU PLANS TO INCREASE IMMIGRATION
2645	3	Hungary launches new anti-immigrant media campaign targeting George Soros and EU Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, accused of facilitating illegal immigration.
2645	5	"The Budapest government Facebook page explains that the campaign includes posters with images of stateless billionaire Soros and a smiling Juncker above the words ""You too have the right to know what Brussels is preparing""."
2645	6	"""They want to introduce mandatory reception quotas, weaken the right of member states to defend borders, facilitate immigration with migrant visas"", we read."
2645	8	"Viktor Orban's government, which has often clashed with the EU over migration, has already waged similar campaigns in the past, including ""Let's stop Brussels"" and ""Don't let Soros have the last laugh""."
2645	10	"In recent years Orban has called the 88-year-old stateless speculator a ""public enemy"" because he advocates mass uncontrolled immigration."
2645	12	"""Brussels continues to support illegal immigration,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in Budapest. “Hungarians need to know this and that is why the latest information campaign was launched,” he added, denying that it is part of the campaign for the next European Parliament elections."
2645	14	"According to Kovacs, in the ""drawers of Brussels"" there are plans to increase funding for NGOs and to create a special fund for migrants."
2647	1	Europe gets rid of Scholz before it's too late
2647	3	"A few days ago we wrote that Europe has a chance of continuing to count on the international arena only if it agrees to rely on Macron. Merit of the French president, of course, but ""merit"" above all of the incredible weakness of Olaf Scholz, the most impalpable German chancellor since the time of the Weimar Republic."
2647	5	From the birth of the EEC onwards, we have been used to seeing Germany impose the most important choices in economic and diplomatic matters on all of Europe, alone or with the help of France. But since Angela Merkel left power something has jammed: Scholz seems unable to make any decision. In the last two weeks he has remained silent in the face of all the main questions that have been posed to him by the press and colleagues: he has not been able to explain what he intends to do on the Stability Pact (shall we change it or not?), on the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline (the freezes or not?) about sending weapons to Ukraine (do we send them or not?).
2647	7	"His pathetic attempt to ""buy time"" while waiting for problems to resolve themselves has allowed Macron, one who certainly does not waste time occupying the spaces vacated by others, to take command of the European caravanserai. Like it or not, on fundamental issues such as energy supplies, the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis and relations with the other superpowers, the European Union is destined to speak French."
2647	9	"According to the prestigious newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, Scholz's indolence ""is damaging transatlantic relations more than Trump ever did"", commenting acidly that ""when the American president does more to prevent a war in Europe than the German chancellor, there it is something wrong with German foreign policy.”"
2647	11	It is true that Scholz's weakness is the result first of all of the insane policies of Angela Merkel, who handed over Germany hand and foot to Russia and China, two authoritarian countries governed by immovable regimes. In the case of Russia, the subordination is due to the construction of the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, which directly connects the two countries via the Baltic Sea and makes Germany completely dependent on supplies from Moscow. In the case of China, the fact that in recent years Germany has focused heavily on exports to the Chinese market, leaving a large part of its GDP to depend on the willingness of the Chinese to buy goods made in Germany. So now Scholz knows he cannot move against the two countries without risking painful retaliation.
2647	13	"That is not enough: according to the specialized site Politico, some EU officials and diplomats have admitted that Berlin has even worked in the shadows to prevent the definition of a common European position against China. Scholz's office feared that the EU was ""defending too much"" Lithuania against economic coercion from Beijing, so much so that dozens of phone calls were sent from the chancellery to all German-speaking Commissioners to ease the pressure on them as much as possible. of Beijing, opposing among other things the hard line of Paris. Obviously, the fact that Lithuania is a member state of the EU does not appear to Scholz as a sufficient reason to defend it against a ferocious dictatorship."
2647	15	It must be repeated: if this is the quality of leadership that Berlin can offer, Draghi did well to bind himself to the French with the Quirinal Pact. For heaven's sake, Macron is not De Gasperi and is afflicted by the usual delusions of grandeur so common across the Alps, but at least he has a slightly more articulated idea of ​​Europe than that of Scholz, who seems increasingly to have ended up by chance covering what it is (was?) the most important post on the continent.
2648	1	"Putin's adviser warns of ""global famine"" by the end of this year"
2648	3	"One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's top aides has warned that a ""global famine"" could begin by the end of 2022, due to grain shortages caused by the conflict in Ukraine."
2648	5	"""It is important that in the conditions, for example, of a global famine that will occur around the autumn, by the end of this year all over the world, Russia does not have to suffer, but is fully supplied with food"" Putin adviser Maxim Oreshkin said at a forum in Moscow last week, according to state media Rt."
2648	7	"Oreshkin said the famine will, in part, be caused by US monetary policy. ""Until around 2020, world market wheat prices were stable, but following the increased dollar printing that started around July 2020, prices started to rise sharply,"" he said, referring to Washington's measures. to cope with the effect of the lockdown policies. “Indeed, what America is trying to do now with Ukraine is eliminate the grain reserves Ukraine currently has in its possession, which is just yet another action dooming Ukraine to serious problems. humanitarians, and also condemns the global community to have big problems with hunger."
2648	9	The AFP news agency reports that in the meantime, according to Oreshkin, Russia has been actively preparing for a possible shortage of grain: «Russia is actively preparing for a global famine; it all started at the end of last year».
2648	11	However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the United Nations Security Council accused Moscow of blockading Ukrainian ports with warships last week, accusing Russia of using food as a weapon of war: «It appears that the Russian government he thinks using food as a weapon will help accomplish what his invasion failed to do: […] break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. As a result of the Russian government's actions, some 20 million tons of grain remain unused in Ukrainian silos. Last week, wheat prices hit an all-time high after India, the world's second largest wheat producer, said it would halt wheat exports. Following India's announcement, the price of wheat futures rose 5.9% on May 16 to hit an all-time high of $12.68 per bushel.
2648	13	Both Russia and Ukraine, meanwhile, account for about a third of total grain supplies. Ukraine is also a major exporter of barley, corn, sunflower oil and canola oil.
2648	15	Blinken also rejected Russian claims that US economic sanctions against Russia were responsible for the price hike: “The sanctions imposed by the US and many other countries deliberately include exemptions for food, fertilizers and seeds from Russia. The decision to weaponize food belongs only to Moscow».
2649	1	Turkey does not want “supporters of terrorism” in NATO
2649	3	Sweden and Finland have not yet responded to Ankara's security requests, President Erdogan said
2649	5	"Turkey will not approve Finland and Sweden's NATO membership applications until they properly address Ankara's concerns about their alleged support for terrorist organizations, President Erdogan said, vowing not to repeat ""the mistakes of the past""."
2649	7	"""As long as Tayyip Erdogan is at the head of the Republic of Turkey, we will absolutely not be able to say 'yes' to the entry into NATO of countries that support terrorism,"" the Turkish leader told reporters returning from a trip to Azerbaijan, according to reports yesterday, Sunday 29 May, by the state media."
2649	9	Delegations from Sweden and Finland met with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara for talks last week, following the joint application by the Nordic countries to join the US-led military alliance. Despite the meeting, however, the Ankara government has once again threatened to block the process unless the two countries crack down on groups it considers extremist.
2649	11	"“They are not honest and sincere,” Erdogan said of the results of the talks. ""They do not take the necessary measures, they continue to allow terrorists to walk freely on the streets of Stockholm and provide them with their own police security."" ""We cannot repeat the same mistake made in the past towards these countries that host and feed terrorists"", added Erdogan, referring to the long-standing feud with Athens over Cyprus, and recalling how in 1980 Ankara ""allowed Greece to return"" after his partial withdrawal from NATO."
2649	13	"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has previously acknowledged that Finland and Sweden are unlikely to become NATO members if they do not meet Turkey's demands. ""No country has suffered as much from terrorist attacks as Turkey,"" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding that Turkey is an ""important ally and when an ally has concerns it should be discussed and the problem resolved."""
2649	15	We recall that joining the Alliance of the two Nordic countries requires the unanimous consent of all 30 member states and Turkey has threatened to block the process unless Finland and Sweden crack down on groups that Ankara considers extremist.
2650	1	Johnson's handshake with bin Salman... the 'moral' lesson!
2650	3	In Saudi Arabia, various sectors of the public gave a moral 'no' to Britain saying: 'Johnson's handshake with an autocrat who has just committed mass murder' means that 'Britain is ready to do a deal with the devil to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.
2650	5	The article published yesterday by the newspaper and written by the director of the legal charity, Reprieve, which tracks grave human rights abuses, indicated that Boris Johnson's visit to Saudi Arabia came after the Gulf kingdom executed 81 men a few days ago, asking: Johnson don't you quite understand public opinion in Britain? Or did things change after the Russian war against Ukraine?
2650	7	Although the writer said that “Johnson's handshake with an autocrat who had just presided over a mass murder would damage Britain's moral standing on the world stage,” she explained that “in the weeks following the invasion of Russian forces in Ukraine, there was a feeling that the calculation has changed. Increasingly, Conservative ministers are saying the government should do everything it can to reduce Britain's dependence on Russian gas and that it should make a deal with the devil, Mark Almond, director of the Institute for Crisis, told the Daily Mail. Research.
2650	9	"Writer Maya Foa said that ""since Jamal Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and assassinated, Western leaders have mostly shied away from the kingdom, avoiding taking pictures with the crown prince."""
2650	11	Foa felt that “the timing of the executions is appalling. Less than two weeks ago, The Atlantic ran a lengthy interview with the crown prince promoting comprehensive updates to the Saudi criminal justice system.
2650	13	"He added that by visiting Saudi Arabia, ""Johnson confirms that the Saudi authorities can kill whoever they want, at any time, and the West will ignore it."""
2650	15	"“The Kingdom of Saudi effectively ensures that more people are executed whose only crime was to challenge the status quo,” he said. People like Hassan al-Maliki, a cleric who is currently facing the death penalty for the contents of his library."""
2650	17	"Foa explained: “Saudi justice is a black box we can never be sure of. The European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, which maintains a comprehensive record of executions in Saudi Arabia, was unaware of even 69 cases (out of the 81 that were executed). These men were tried, convicted and executed in complete secrecy."""
2650	19	“Out of the 12 we know of, at least three of them are likely to have been tortured to make false confessions of terrorist offenses after participating in pro-democracy demonstrations,” he said.
2650	21	He said that while “authorities describe the executed men as terrorists, there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders and people who were arrested as children on death row. “
2650	23	He recalled that in 2014 the British and Saudi governments signed a memorandum of understanding on judicial cooperation.
2650	25	“My organization, Reprieve, made a request based on the right to know, but it was rejected on the grounds that the disclosure of information could negatively impact the effective management of international relations,” said the author. Because of this secrecy, we have no idea whether British assistance supported a torture- and execution-based justice system in Saudi Arabia.”
2650	27	"He added: “What we know from European-Saudi Human Rights Organization reports and media monitoring is that in the period this deal has been implemented, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has significantly increased the frequency of executions, so so far there have been more than 900 cases since 2015. In January alone, the British Justice Minister, Dominic Raab, met his counterpart, Sheikh Walid Al-Samaani, and said he was happy to hear about the progress of Saudi Arabia in Judicial Reform and Human Rights. He was considered a fool."""
2650	29	“The Prime Minister's trip to Riyadh shortly after this mass execution is a shame for him personally and for Britain,” said Maya Foa. Would anyone in his inner circle tell him that there are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than to encourage and enable a murderous system?
2650	31	Here we have to say that the West, which proved to us to be racist when it differentiated between refugees from Ukraine and refugees from Asia and Africa. The Netherlands has also expelled Syrian refugees, and has welcomed blond-haired, blue-eyed Ukrainians, as portrayed in the Western press, as well as Britain's moral claims, with enthusiasm. Its Prime Minister meets bin Salman and shakes his hand with hands stained with the blood of people who have done nothing but ask for something like equality and democracy, that is the moral reputation of the West.
2666	1	The war against the unvaccinated will not be forgotten
2666	3	If you have refused to accept the official narrative about Covid vaccines, you have probably found yourself suffering hateful attacks and rejections. Some of these zealots may now realize they were wrong, but few want to talk about it. How do you choose to move forward?
2666	5	Fomenting hatred is a tool of tyrants, and over the past two years, political leaders, agency directors, academics, medical professionals and media personalities have publicly encouraged hatred and violence and wished a painful death on anyone he didn't want to be part of that medical experiment that is the Covid vaccines.
2666	7	In an eloquent post on Medium, journalist Susan Dunham summarizes the lessons (hopefully) learned from hate and the attack on the unvaccinated (1):
2666	9	“Obligations have been relaxed, and both sides are stumbling back into something resembling the old normal – except there is a new and current wound inflicted on the people we have been trying to break. And nobody wants to talk about it.
2666	11	Just a few weeks ago, our own leaders admitted they wanted to make life unlivable for the unvaccinated. And as an empowered collective, we have multiplied the pain, bringing the struggle into our families, friendships and workplaces. Today we face the hard truth that none of this was warranted, and in doing so, we discover a valuable lesson.
2666	13	It was a rapid slide from righteousness to cruelty, and much as we may blame our leaders for the push, we are responsible for falling into the trap despite better judgment.
2666	15	We knew that declining immunity equated large numbers of the vaccinated with a dwindling minority of the unvaccinated, yet we marked them for special persecution. We said they had not “done the right thing” by turning away from state care, even though we knew that principled opposition to such a thing is priceless under any circumstances…
2666	17	And so it was that, thanks to willful ignorance of science, civics, and politics, we oppressed the unvaccinated to the point where we did… We cannot hold our heads up, as if we believe we have logic, love or truth on our side as we fiercely wish death on the unvaccinated. The best we can do is sit in the awareness of our angry inhumanity at having marginalized so many people…
2666	19	Opposing them has been a tremendous embarrassment for many of us, who now understand that obligations only had the power that we gave them. It was not through quiet acquiescence that we avoided the endless dominance of drug companies and door-to-door medical checkups.
2666	21	"It was thanks to the people we tried to bring down… We took the bait by hating them, but their persistence gave us time to realize we were wrong. Now it looks like obligations will return, but this time there is hope that many of us will see them for what they are: a growing authoritarianism that doesn't care about our well-being."""
2666	23	Forgive and forget?
2666	25	Dunham approaches the situation from the perspective of those who have fallen prey to the hypnotic command to despise anyone – including friends and family – who refuse to believe the official narrative about Covid vaccines. However, most of you have probably been victims of these attacks.
2666	27	How did you choose to deal with them? What have you learned? I suspect many of you are willing to forgive, but few will ever forget those betrayals. But as Dunham noted, nobody really wants to talk about what was done.
2666	29	"Everyone carries on as if it never happened. As if our leaders didn't ask for our deaths. As if our president hadn't warned us that his patience with us was ""running out"" (2) - a threat that implied that bad things would happen once his patience ran out. As if news anchors like Don Lemon hadn't said we deserved to starve and shouldn't have walked into a grocery store (3), (4). But these things they said, and family and friends rejected us as a result."
2668	1	Zelensky holograms: War projects us into the future
2668	3	That war and technological development go hand in hand is now almost known to everyone, and a similar argument can be made by thinking about the combination of war and propaganda. However, what had no clear connection up to now was the relationship between technological development and propaganda.
2668	5	Of course, any new creation that can be sold to the public always goes through its advertising before being launched on the market but, up to now, events so shamelessly aimed at welding technology with war propaganda, thus going beyond simple advertising, are hardly remembered in recent history. as we have understood it up to now in the world of consumption.
2668	7	Today it happens instead that, after the tour in the various national Parliaments and the appearances here and there, the Zelensky phenomenon also arrives in the various tech festivals underway or recently completed in various European capitals. And what better way to do that than through a hologram.
2668	9	Yes, you understood correctly, as reported in the article in the source, also taken from the Italian site drcommodore.it, holograms of Zelensky appeared at the VivaTech fair in Paris, at the Brilliant Minds in Stockholm, at the Founders Forum in London and at The Next Web in Amsterdam, and in all cases the script was the same.
2668	11	The Ukrainian president, by now a real star of the western mob, has once again asked for help to defeat his Russian enemies, in this case, however, not by turning to governments but to private citizens. And to encourage them too to invest money in the Ukrainian cause, here is the tempting offer: invest in Ukraine and you will be the promoters of an experiment aimed at creating the first digital government (in spite of the Ukrainians who are willing to die for European values ​​like says von der Leyen).
2668	13	"""No other country in the world will offer you such an attractive chance to try the most advanced technologies at the state level. It is an experiment, a digital revolution and, at the same time, a modernization of the current system."""
2668	15	– announced one of Zelensky's holograms
2668	17	Hence, a simple war is shamelessly revealed for what it really is: an experiment…not just a social one to test the reaction of the European peoples to sacrifice in the name of defense of Ukraine, not just a military one to test new weapons in the field, including new drones and the like, not only political to see what happens if a comedian becomes a politician and then an influencer, but also – and perhaps above all at this point, given the looming digital/virtual/green revolution – technological.
2668	19	What will become of Ukraine is not yet clear, many different and overlapping interests vie for that portion of territory, like rabid dogs vying for a slice of meat. What is certain is that there is an increasingly visible common thread linking the pandemic and war, aimed at a complete transformation of the Western lifestyle. Too bad that instead of looking for this thread, most people stop to look at Zelensky's holograms.
2679	1	China, communist indoctrination never dies: Xi Jinping becomes a school subject in elementary school
2679	3	Communists are like the wolves of proverbs: they shed their hair, but not their vice. What is happening in China is emblematic, where the unique communist thought of its president Xi Jinping reaches elementary schools.
2679	5	"Xi Jinping's thought even ends up in elementary school. In fact, he will enter the school curriculum throughout China to strengthen the ""Marxist"" and ""patriotic"" approach of national education."
2679	7	From Mao's Little Red Book to Xi Jinping's Thought
2679	9	"The Ministry of Education has issued a ""guide"" to teaching materials for courses on the thought of the Chinese president. ""Xi Jinping's ideological system of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is rigorous, logical, full of broad and profound connotations,"" said ministry textbook bureau director Tian Huisheng, quoted in a statement. by the Chinese media, and it is ""necessary to fully and accurately understand the essence of the Chinese leader's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era"""
2679	11	The thought of the leader of the Beijing regime, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party in China, will have to be introduced in all courses of study, from primary to university education. Xi's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era entered the Chinese constitution in 2018, at the beginning of his second term as president, and at the end of a process of consolidating Xi at the top of power that culminated in the elimination of the constraint of the double mandate at the helm of the state, which paved the way for his leadership indefinitely.
2679	13	The Chinese president has lifted the two-term constraint
2679	15	Xi Jinping, 68, with a degree in chemical engineering, has imposed changes to the Constitution since 2018 that will allow him as president of the People's Republic of China to exceed the two-term limit (ten years in total) that was introduced in 1982, as reaction to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, attributed to the undisputed authority of Mao Tse-tung. The highest state office is the prerogative of Xi Jinping, who simultaneously exercises the role of party secretary. He has been President of the People's Republic of China since 14 March 2013.
2684	1	NATO lies implode… Kiev regime told :”Pay the price for peace”
2684	3	The lasting damage of the crumbling lies is the erosion of supposed leadership by the US and NATO accomplices.
2684	5	The Biden administration, the Western news media (aka the propaganda system) and the NATO military axis are in a head-on collision with reality. An early sign is the abatement of the aggressive stance and their petty regime in Kiev has been urged to cut losses and make a deal with Russia.
2684	7	"For the past four months since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine, Western public opinion has been filled with nonstop lies about Moscow's ""illegal aggression"", about how Russia was losing the war because of the "" heroic defenders” and how NATO was upholding inviolable principles of Ukrainian sovereignty that somehow “justified” the flood of weapons into the country."
2684	9	"Now Jens Stoltenberg, the civilian head of the US-led transatlantic alliance, is tentatively waving a white flag of surrender to the inevitable reality. Speaking at a conference in Finland last weekend, Stoltenberg urged the Kiev regime to ""pay the price for peace"" by ceding territorial claims to Russia. The former Norwegian premier, comical wooden statuette that he is, is no doubt used as a mouthpiece for more strategic planners in the transatlantic establishment."
2684	11	"The ""price for peace"" would involve the recognition by the Ukrainian authorities of the Crimean peninsula as part of the Russian Federation and the independence of the republics of Donbass. The Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24 was launched to defend those Russian-speaking territories against offensives by the NATO-backed Kiev regime and its Nazi battalions."
2684	13	This marks a surprising about-face by the NATO bloc. Since the CIA-sponsored coup in Kiev in 2014 and the secession of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, Moscow has been continually vilified for allegedly annexing the peninsula as the United States and its European Union allies have piled round after round of economic sanctions.
2684	15	"The alleged restoration of Ukraine's ""territorial integrity"" has been a recurring motif for the growing hostility of the US-led NATO axis towards Russia. Now, however, the head of the NATO bloc is telling the Kiev regime that it better prepare to cede territory for the sake of peace. So much for the principle! And what was the point of all these years of escalating economic sanctions against Russia over Crimea?"
2684	17	The shift in thinking reflects the nascent reality that the Russian military intervention in Ukraine is indeed proving to be a success. Moscow secured Russian-speaking regions and severely damaged the Nazi-infested Ukrainian army. Even the idea of ​​Ukraine joining NATO is out of the question.
2684	19	Just a few weeks ago, Western governments and their respectful media were awash with claims that Russia was facing a strategic defeat by NATO-armed Ukrainian forces. US President Joe Biden and his Secretary of State Antony Blinken showed confidence in this.
2684	20	So is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his top foreign diplomat, Liz Truss. What will they say now?
2684	22	"The Nazi nature of the Ukrainian forces has been covered up in stories of ""heroic defenders"". When Russia consolidated its fighting power in eastern Ukraine to take Donbass, Western media gleefully reported this as a retreat. On the contrary, several independent military analysts and sources on the ground were giving the opposite and more accurate view, claiming that the Russian forces and their allies in Donbass were doing exactly what they set out to do: liberate the Russian-speaking territory."
2684	24	Now that Russia is well on its way to achieving its goals, the Western propaganda narrative is crumbling due to the lies it has always been built upon.
2684	26	"There will be a lot of gnashing of teeth over the failure of the final propaganda. The debacle in Afghanistan will look like a sideshow of this epic failure. Hundreds of billions of dollars and euros of US and NATO weapons sent to Ukraine have done nothing to ""defend"" the country. You have been a boon to the military-industrial complex and its political mercenaries. But the wave of weapons hasn't stopped Russia from achieving its goals."
2684	28	"The conflict's global economic fallout — entirely avoidable if the United States and its NATO partners had engaged diplomatically with Russia to resolve Moscow's longstanding security woes — has hit Western states with a vengeance. Rising energy prices and bills are seriously harming millions of workers who see the economic calamity not as Russia's fault (so-called ""Putin's price hike"") but as a result of Washington and Brussels' geopolitical games and indifference elitist. This is just another facet of reality – one of the immense implications of an unprecedented social upheaval – that is forcing the Western ruling class to bail out Ukraine's disaster."
2684	30	"The head-on collision with reality will create explosive reactions. The Western powers are already moving Kiev towards accepting her fate as a redundant pawn. Stoltenberg's advice to ""pay a price for peace"" is the overture to Kiev being told to get real and cut her losses. Western audiences will rightly see through this opportunity and utter unscrupulousness and wonder what all the fake drama and ridiculous taxpayer funded spending was all about. An angry backlash is coming for the charlatans in charge."
2684	32	We can expect the Western media to start looking for scapegoats to “explain” Russia's success. Point to reports like this recent one from the New York Times that blames Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for tactical mistakes. But the insufferable victimhood of the Kiev regime and its over-the-top comedian-turned-president will no doubt rage and redouble with impossible demands for American and NATO “defense.” Zelensky has a knack for naming and shaming perceived lack of indulgence. He was primed to function this way and his Western celebrity status gives him a false sense of importance.
2684	34	History is littered with CIA-sponsored puppets that outlive their usefulness and are then discarded like garbage. If Zelensky and his clique get angry by not playing catch with the US and their NATO partners trying to hide their pack of lies, i.e. by not accepting his role as scapegoat, then Zelensky will face a “pension plan” more energetic.
2684	36	"But ultimately the lasting damage of the unraveling lies is the erosion of supposed leadership by the US and NATO accomplices. Russian President Vladimir Putin has derided US claims as ""the empire of lies"". It is turning out to be an objective fate."
2685	1	Austria, Kurz: “We don't welcome Afghan refugees, we have too many. Stop illegal immigration”
2685	3	"We will not welcome into our country any fleeing Afghan, not under my power"". For Sebastian Kurz, the 2015 refugee policy cannot be the solution, neither for Kabul nor for the European Union. And even in the face of a humanitarian emergency such as the Afghan one, the Austrian chancellor maintains, in an interview with La Stampa, that ""our position is realistic: the integration of Afghans is very difficult and requires a expenditure of energy that we cannot afford""."
2685	4	Austria's no to Afghan refugees
2685	6	"With more than 44,000 Afghans entering our country in recent years, Austria already hosts the fourth largest Afghan community in the world, if we consider the distribution of migrants by number of inhabitants. There are far more Afghan refugees living with us than those who have taken over Italy or other EU states. This year alone, around 8,000 refugees have arrived here, a fifth of them from Kabul, via the still open Balkan route""."
2685	8	"The difficulty of integrating Afghans, according to Kurz, lies above all in ""their level of education, mostly low and divergent in fundamental values. Let's think carefully about this fact: more than half of young Afghans already living in Austria, for example, support violence if their religion is outraged. Therefore, when it is said that we are not in solidarity, this is not true. We are focusing on supporting Afghanistan's neighboring countries, to provide protection and assistance to Afghans in the region. The dramatic developments in Kabul took everyone by surprise. We must now put massive pressure on the Taliban to continue to respect women's rights and human rights. The progress made over the last 20 years must not be undone. The EU can and will exert pressure together with its international partners. Furthermore, it should focus on supporting neighboring states to take care of refugees and the fight against Islamic terrorism, especially Isis-K""."
2685	10	"Austrian Chancellor Kurz: ""Enough with illegal immigration"""
2685	12	"For the Austrian chancellor, “it is now clear to all European governments that illegal immigration must be fought and Europe's external borders must be made secure. We must in no way repeat the mistakes of 2015: unlimited entry. Also because the conditions since then have changed in various parts of the world. We have been pursuing this line for years, but now many other states see it as we do. Countries governed by social democrats such as Sweden and Denmark are also pursuing a restrictive migration policy. In order for there to be no more flows like six years ago, we must break the business model of human smugglers, stop irregular migrants at the external borders and return them to their countries of origin or to safe third countries""."
2685	14	On the hypothesis of the creation of a common European defence, Kurz states that “Austria is a small neutral country in the heart of Europe, but we participate in the Union's foreign and security policy, in the PSDC and CFSP defense projects, which need to be further implemented. We also make a disproportionate contribution to peacekeeping missions, for example in the Western Balkans, Mali or Lebanon. Instead, the proposal of the candidate for chancellor in Germany, Armin Laschet, of a European FBI deserves careful examination: the Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, in Berlin, Paris, Nice or Vienna, have clearly demonstrated that Europe must collaborate even more so in the fight against Islamic terrorism”.
2689	1	They rape women, old people and children: immigrants out of control
2689	3	"It was just after dawn on 9 August 2021 when a 26-year-old girl was surprised from behind, dragged by the arm and raped in the excavation for the water pipes of a construction site in Cascina Gobba, a stone's throw from the San Raffaele hospital, by an Egyptian aged 31 without a regular residence permit. On 6 December, however, a young commuter was attacked on the Milan-Varese train by two boys in their early twenties. The first, the one who would have acted as a ""stake"", is an Italian citizen with drug addiction problems; the other - the perpetrator of the attempted rape - is a Moroccan with a police record and illegal on Italian territory. And then the horror of New Year's Eve: dozens of girls are harassed by a gang of foreigners a stone's throw from the Milan Cathedral during the celebrations for the start of the new year."
2689	5	“The Istat data speak for themselves: foreigners are five times more responsible than Italians for the crimes of sexual violence – specifies the commissioner Riccardo De Corato – Despite the tightening of penalties, harassment and rapes do not decrease. Policies in favor of respect for women seem to have failed to take hold of a part of the foreign population - and the very serious episode that took place on New Year's Eve in Piazza Duomo confirms this - which continues to consider women as an object, a property of which man can do what he wants”.
2689	7	"""Please stop."" That desperate cry, then the horror of the clandestine:"
2689	9	"On June 2, several teenagers were harassed with shocking harassment on the train to Peschiera after returning from a morning spent on Lake Garda. The perpetrators, not yet all identified, allegedly addressed racist insults to the young victims: ""You are white, you must not stay here (on the train, ed.)."" A worrying phenomenon, which marks a negative record in Lombardy, that relating to sexual crimes."
2689	11	“In our capital (Milan ed) the trend of recent years has never seen a decline, unfortunately – adds De Corato – Indeed it is growing slightly given that from 273 cases in 2011 it went to 285 in 2021. In my opinion the situation is very worrying”.
2690	1	Italy remains almost the only country to still impose the use of masks
2690	3	Almost 30 months after the start of the pandemic and despite the declared end of the state of emergency, Italy remains almost the only country to still impose the use of masks in some places, including schools, despite the distancing imposed and strictly adhered to by the children at the counter. Beyond the environmental impact, it is necessary to seriously evaluate their usefulness and potential harmful effects on the health of the wearer.
2690	5	In a study published in May 2020, Dr. Alberto Donzelli had critically analyzed the RCTs reported in a previous systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of medical masks in preventing respiratory infections in university/community settings and outdoor gatherings. The study also highlighted the possible undesirable effects deriving from the prolonged and incorrect use of the masks:
2690	7	"“There are certain, multiple and underestimated risks of a dermatological type, up to lesions that can constitute other gateways for pathogens. [...] In fact, in unaware infected subjects, in which the emission of viruses is maximum in the two days preceding the symptoms (which may not even appear at all!), the mask obliges a continuous respiratory recirculation of their viruses, adding resistance to exhalation, with the concrete risk of pushing a high viral load deep into the alveoli, which could be defeated by the innate defenses if it only impacted the upper respiratory tract, well supplied with ready-made IgA and IgG."""
2690	9	Why is this device still made excessive and excessive use to curb transmission and why does the Government still impose its use, without taking into account the negative and harmful aspects? What do we know more today than that study of May 2020 and the many randomized controlled trials conducted before and during the pandemic that still justify the persistence of this (once again) all-Italian anomaly?
2690	11	To the many that already exist, several new interesting studies have been added that highlight the damage caused by the masks; just to name a few:
2690	13	- Is a Mask That Covers the Mouth and Nose Free from Undesirable Side Effects in Everyday Use and Free of Potential Hazards? which refers to 44 experimental studies and 65 publications to conclude that the prolonged use of the mask generates important effects and consequences under various medical aspects.
2690	14	- Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air With or Without Face Masks in Healthy Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial which highlights how masks of any type cause an increase in carbon dioxide in children exceeding the limits considered acceptable up to now.
2690	15	"- Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe ""Although no cause-effect conclusions can be deduced from this observational analysis - conclude the study authors -, the lack of negative correlations between mask use and of Covid-19 suggests that the widespread use of masks at a time when effective intervention was most needed, i.e. during the sharp fall-winter 2020-2021 peak, was unable to reduce the incidence. Furthermore, the moderate positive correlation between mask use and deaths in Western Europe also suggests that universal use has harmful consequences.”"
2690	17	But a striking comparison work was set out in a recent article from the Brownstone Institute which concluded that masks, whether surgical or cloth, by themselves have no impact on controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. In the article, 167 studies are examined and in the light of which it can certainly be said that the evidence demonstrates that such a device is not only ineffective for the purpose of controlling the virus, but is harmful, especially on children.
2690	19	On what grounds, considered scientific, does the Government still base its directives?
2690	21	"We hope more and more that all the aforementioned studies will be seriously taken into consideration, that we will stop hiding behind the now repeated refrain ""let's protect the fragile"" health measures that are not health, but harmful."
2690	23	We hope that the impact for a child who still has to wear a mask at school will be assessed in its complexity and therefore also from a psychological and educational point of view.
2690	25	Finally, let's hope that people will finally be able to free themselves from this harmful device, which has now become a mere symbol of terror, but in fact useless for the purposes of real, healthy and effective protection.
25106	1	Only with us: Greta Thunberg on the climate crisis
25106	3	Earth Day: Greta Thunberg on the climate crisis
25106	5	In an impassioned letter, an 18-year-old Swedish girl explains why world leaders must take more radical action to avert catastrophe.
25106	7	Greta Thunberg was only 15 years old when in August 2018 she started her weekly protests in front of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm. She couldn't understand why no one was talking about how big a problem the climate crisis was. Since then, the 18-year-old activist has mobilized millions of people to take to the streets, and has become one of the most recognizable faces of the environmental movement in the world.
25106	9	On Earth Day, April 22, 2021, during the climate summit organized by the President of the United States, Joe Biden, the leaders of the participating countries will present new commitments to combat the climate crisis, including a project to achieve zero emissions by 2050. They will call them ambitious projects. When we compare what the latest scientific advances offer us with the so-called climate goals, we see a serious gap - where we really need to act, we have a delay of decades.
25106	11	Of course, we should support all activities that are to ensure a secure future for us and protect against deterioration of living conditions. The goals presented at the summit could be a great starting point, if not for a small detail - they are full of loopholes and loopholes. Such as ignoring emissions from imported goods, aviation and international transport, and burning biomass. They make it possible to manipulate the output data, exclude feedback and tipping points, ignore the key aspect of fair share and historical emissions share. For this reason, these goals depend entirely on abstract calculations and virtually inaccessible technologies. I don't have time to go into details right now.
25106	13	The thing is, we can still use creative carbon accounting and cheat our calculations to pretend that the goals we set are what we need now. However, we must not forget that while it is possible to deceive others and even ourselves, nature and physics cannot be deceived. Whether we do our calculations honestly or not, emissions are a fact.
25106	15	"People in power are not held accountable because awareness of the issue is still low. This is the crux of the problem. If you call their commitments ""courageous"" or ""ambitious"", you do not fully understand how serious a situation we are in."
25106	17	I met many world leaders. Even they themselves admit that the goals they set do not correspond to the commitments they have made. It's completely natural. After all, they only do what they consider possible to do in connection with the political situation. Their job is to fulfill the wishes of the voters, and if voters do not demand real action to stop the climate catastrophe, it is obvious that nothing will change. Fortunately, that's how democracy works. It is public opinion that rules the free world. If we want change, we need to raise public awareness and show that what seems impossible can become possible.
25106	19	We understand that the world is complicated, that many people do what they can, and what we need is not easy. Of course, even insufficient goals are better than nothing. But we can't settle for something just because it's better than nothing. We must do more. We have to believe that we can do it - and we really are. If we unite and set ourselves a specific goal, the impossible will cease to exist.
25106	21	I'm not ready to give up
25106	23	World leaders admit capitulation to the 1.5°C target. They give up on their promises and our future. I don't know about you, but I know I'm not ready to give up. I will never give up. We will fight for a secure future. Even a fraction of a degree matters, it will always matter.
25106	25	You may say that we are naive to believe that change is possible. All right. But at least we are not naive enough to believe that our problems will be solved by countries and companies setting vague, distant and insufficient targets if they do not face pressure from the media and the public.
25106	27	The gap between what needs to be done and what we actually do is getting bigger by the minute. The gap between the necessary actions and the level of awareness and attention devoted to the problem is becoming more and more absurd. And the gap between so-called climate targets and currently available science should no longer be ignored.
25106	29	These gaps in action, awareness and lack of time are the most obvious problems that are not talked about. Real change will not be possible until we address it. Without specific actions, we will not find a solution.
25106	31	The king is naked - let's stop turning a blind eye to that.
25107	1	"""We kids shouldn't be doing this. But since almost no one is doing anything, we have to"
25107	3	Greta Thunberg - a 16-year-old who fights for the climate, e.g. while on strike in front of the Swedish parliament, she published a Facebook post in which she responded to the allegations against her.
25107	5	Greta also became famous for her speech at the UN climate conference in Katowice, as well as the recent summit in Davos. She became a symbol and inspiration for the youth strike in the streets of Brussels.
25107	7	We encourage you to familiarize yourself with her position, which we have translated into Polish:
25107	9	“Recently, I've seen a lot of rumors about me and a huge amount of hate. This is no surprise to me. I know that since most people are not aware of the full meaning of the climate crisis (which is understandable as it has never been treated as a crisis), a school strike for climate seems very strange to the general public. So let me explain my school strike.
25107	11	In May 2018, I was one of the winners in an environmental text competition organized by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. My article was published and some people contacted me, including Bo Thorén of Fossil Free Dalsland. He had a group of people, mostly young people, who wanted to do something about the climate crisis. I had several conference calls with other activists. The aim was to present ideas for new projects that will draw attention to the climate crisis. Because he had some ideas for things we could do, from marches to the loose idea of ​​some kind of school strike (school kids would do something on school playgrounds or in classrooms). We were inspired by Parkland students who refused to go to school after school shootings.
25107	13	I liked the idea of ​​a school strike. So I developed this idea and tried to get other young people to join me, but no one was really interested. They thought the Swedish version of the Zero Hour march would have a bigger impact. That's why I planned a school strike myself, and then I didn't take part in any meetings.
25107	15	When I told my parents about my plans, they didn't like it very much. They did not support the idea of ​​a school strike and said that if I did, I would have to act alone and without any support.
25107	17	On August 20, I sat in front of the Swedish Parliament. I distributed flyers with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explanations of why I am on strike. The first thing I did was post on Twitter and Instagram what I was doing, and it soon went viral.
25107	19	Later, journalists and newspapers began to arrive. One of the first was the Swedish entrepreneur working in the climate movement, Ingmar Rentzhog. He talked to me and took pictures which he posted on Facebook. It was the first time I met or talked to him. I had never spoken to him before or met him.
25107	21	"Many people love to spread rumors that I have people ""following me"" or am ""paid"" or ""used"" to do what I do. But there is no one ""behind"" me - except myself. My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I made them aware of the situation."
25107	23	I am not part of any organization. Sometimes I support and cooperate with several NGOs working for the climate and the environment. But I am absolutely independent and represent only myself. And I do what I do completely free - I have not received any money or any promise of future payments in any form. No one is related to me or my family. And of course it will stay that way. I have not met a single climate activist who would fight for the climate for money. This idea is completely absurd. Also, I only travel with permission from my school and my parents pay for tickets and accommodation.
25107	25	"My family wrote a book together about our family and how me and my sister Beata influenced the way our parents thought and saw the world, especially when it comes to climate. And about our diagnoses. This book was supposed to be released in May, but due to serious disagreements with the publishing company, we ended up changing the publisher. That's why the book came out in August. Before the book was published, the parents declared that any profits from the book ""Scener ur hjärtat"" (""Scenes from the heart"") will be donated to 8 different charities - dealing with the environment, children with diagnoses and animal rights."
25107	27	Yes, I write my own speeches. But because I know that what I say will reach many people, I often ask many people for support. I also have a few scientists whom I often ask for help in expressing some complicated things. I want everything to be absolutely correct so as not to spread incorrect facts or things that could be misunderstood.
25107	29	"Some people make fun of me because of my diagnosis. But Asperger's is not a disease, it's a gift. People also say that because I have Asperger's, I can't put myself in that position. But that's why I did it. Because if I was ""normal"" and sociable, I would organize myself in an organization or start an organization myself. But since I'm not that good with people, I did that instead."
25107	31	I was very frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis and I felt like I had to do something, anything. And sometimes doing NOTHING - like sitting in front of parliament - speaks louder than doing something. Like a whisper sometimes it's louder than a scream.
25107	33	"There is also an accusation that ""I sound and write like an adult"". All I can say is: Don't you think a 16-year-old can speak for herself? There are also people who say that I simplify things. For example, when I say that ""the climate crisis is a black and white issue"", ""we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""I want panic"". But I'm only saying that because it's true. The climate crisis is the most complex issue we have encountered. It takes a total effort on our part to stop it."
25107	35	But the solution is black and white – we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Because either we limit warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels or we don't. Either we reach a tipping point where we start a chain reaction - with events that are beyond human control - or we don't. Either we survive as a civilization or we don't. There is nothing in between when it comes to survival.
25107	37	And when I say I want panic, what I mean is that we have to treat a crisis as a crisis. When your house is on fire, don't sit down and talk about how easy it is to rebuild it when you put out the fire. If your house is on fire, run outside and make sure everyone is out when you call the fire department. This requires a certain level of panic.
25107	39	"There's one more argument I can't do anything about. It is the fact that I am ""just a child and we should not listen to children"". But that's easy to fix - just start listening to the solid science. Because if everyone listened to the scientists and the facts that I constantly refer to - no one would have to listen to me or any of the hundreds of thousands of school children who are on strike for the climate around the world. Then we could go back to school."
25107	41	I'm just a messenger and yet I receive all this hate. I'm not saying anything new - I'm just saying what scientists have been saying for decades. And I agree with you - I'm too young to do that. We kids shouldn't be doing this. But since almost no one is doing anything and our future is at stake, we feel we must carry on.
25107	43	And if you have other concerns or doubts about me, you can listen to my TED talk (https://www.ted.com/…/greta_thunberg_the_disarming_…/up-next) where I talk about how it started my interest in climate and the environment.
25107	45	And thank you all for your kind support! It gives me hope.

25114	1	"EU. Tusk, however, received an ""order for Poland"""
25114	3	"Now, my dear Donald, you will return to your country to defend your values ​​again. … when we meet again we will see you, as you said, as prime minister.” More or less, because I quote from memory, Ursula von der Leyen said goodbye to Donald Tusk when he left his office in Brussels, and more precisely, when he was dismissed from the post of EPP chairman, the last job the EU gave him. It is not without reason that Tusk was reminded that he was returning to the country to defend ""values"", which clearly proves that the EU does not like today's Poland. Tusk had a bad face, because in a sense he was forced to work, which he was never particularly eager to do, but he smiled politely for this phrase he heard, ""dear Donald."" This ""road"" can be understood literally, Tusk's tenure in office cost the EU a lot, but not everything turned out in Poland as the EU wanted it to be.
25114 5 The picture described was shown on 06.07.'22 TVP in the evening news. We had it shown there ""at hand"" that Tusk received an ""order for Poland"" from the EU, that he was sent here to restore liberal rule in our country, democratically or undemocratically, it is irrelevant for the principals. This is yet another proof of what today's EU is like, what ""values"" it prefers, how it understands democracy and how it treats free and independent states. And all this is happening in the light of cameras, in the presence of many prominent EU decision-makers, and clearly shows that democracy and the rule of law are just empty slogans for today's EU decision-makers, which can be interpreted as they see fit. This is not the kind of EU we joined in 2004. No one warned us at that time that the democratically elected government would be overthrown in the street, that high-ranking state officials, inconvenient for the liberals, would be forcibly removed from their offices (presidents of the National Bank of Poland and the Constitutional Tribunal), and such actions are announced by Donald Tusk, already ""anointed"" by Ursula von der Leyen as the future Prime Minister of Poland. And this is said by people who have mouths full of ""rule of law"", ""democracy"" and ordinary human ""honesty"". As you can see, this proper honesty, rule of law and democracy must be sought there with a candle.
25114 7 The aforementioned messages also reminded of the judgments issued by the CJEU, a court that is the last resort for leftist liberals when other methods used to subjugate individual states fail. This allegedly only court authorized to adjudicate what is lawful in the EU and what is not, turns out to be an extremely unfair and extremely biased European court, whose main task is to adjudicate in accordance with the interests of Germany and a small group of EU decision-makers who have admitted to themselves the right to steer the Union in completely different directions than those which guided its founding. There are known facts of meetings of the EU ""elites"" with the judges of the CJEU, which was tracked down by French journalists. And was it different in Poland, during the times of the Constitutional Tribunal of President Rzepliński, when the judges of the Tribunals met with PO activists? It is now that the opposition is attacking the Constitutional Tribunal, relying on reports from eastern hackers who spread, quite likely, fabricated information, and Big Brother from the east is rubbing his hands that he has found more ""useful idiots"" who are causing confusion among Poles.
25114 9 Doesn't the CJEU doctrine remind us of something? Isn't this a kind of so-called ""Neumann doctrine"", which says that Polish ""free courts"" will not touch ""their own"", i.e. PO members and supporters, as long as they are ""their own""? The last ""achievement"" of the CJEU was yesterday's ruling that EU countries are obliged to accept illegal immigrants who, for various reasons, are unable to officially apply for asylum. What does it mean? This means, among others, that according to the CJEU, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are obliged to accept migrants sent to us illegally, recruited for this role by eastern dictators. Even a ""Russian troll"" would not have thought of this, that he could demand the legalization of his actions. Of course, no reasonable state will agree with this ruling/judgment, just as individual states have already disagreed with many judgments of this shady instance that puts itself above all law. It is interesting that only Poland, which does not have the largest number of unexecuted judgments of the CJEU, is imposed by this court on large financial penalties, which I hope our country will never pay. Because this Poland, so ""un-Tuskowa"", does not fit the EU?
25114 11 ""Dear Donald"", one would like to say at the end, go back to Brussels, or to some other Berlin, smoke cigars, work your ass off and stop dealing with politics, because, as your achievements in this field testify, no one from such activities of yours He is not satisfied.
25114 13 PS. To all those who accuse me of manipulation, I refer to yesterday's TVP news from 19:30, they are easy to find, watch this fragment that starts from the 16th minute.
25115 1 Shock! President Duda: ""I am asking you to grit your teeth a bit""
25115 3 On Tuesday, President Duda met with the inhabitants of the Lipski poviat (Mazowieckie Voivodeship). During this meeting, he also referred to the problem of high inflation: ""Unfortunately, not only Polish matters determine what our lives look like, but also external ones have an impact (...). I am asking you to be calm, because we are doing everything to minimize inflationary pressure. I ask you to be of good cheer; to grit your teeth a bit and be optimistic. Nobody expected it to come to us. We did not cause a war in Ukraine, we did not cause a pandemic. Prices are rising and we have no influence on it. We've got to get through it somehow.""
25115 5 Let's note that this ""inflationary pressure"" has been exerted by the government for years. Unfortunately, the PiS government focuses on helping in its own style, i.e. by giving away money. Meanwhile, it is the least effective and costly solution. It is known that in order for the government to give someone PLN 2, it must take PLN 3 from someone else, because there is also the cost of transferring and maintaining the appropriate officials. In addition, one-time or short-term financial assistance is not the same as systemic assistance, and it is a heavy burden on the state budget and causes inflation. The programs 500 plus, 300 plus, 13 and 14 pension, anti-inflationary shields, covid allowances for doctors, and now 300 plus for Ukrainians and 1200 plus are significantly indebted to the Polish state, and their effect is primarily populist.
25115 7 Such a 1200 plus program causes many doubts. Firstly, Poles willingly opened the doors of their apartments and houses to Ukrainians, not counting on anything in return. Now the government is interfering in it, inducing the apparent help of those who want to earn money - so it activates the dodgers. A signal is sent to the West because Poles help, because they get money. In addition, 300 plus for a million Ukrainians is PLN 300 million, and 1200 plus is already 1 billion 200 million. It may turn out that the program will be extended. It is estimated that up to 5 million refugees may arrive in our country, and then these costs will be gigantic. The EU threw us scraps, announcing that it would allocate PLN 500 million to help refugees, which in addition would be distributed among all countries hosting them. The Polish government estimates that this aid may amount to as much as PLN 10 billion, i.e. half of what it costs us 500 plus.
25115 9 You have to help, but you have to do it with your head. PLN 300 at a time is emergency aid, which will not be enough for much, but if it is received by 5 million people, it becomes a gigantic amount of PLN 1.5 billion. In a situation where we are extremely indebted after covid, this type of expenses only kills our budget. It seems that the Polish government is happily indebted to the power, like a gambler who won, felt rich and spends money he did not earn. The thing is that the Polish government has not won any money, and it is already spending not even our money, but our children's. It is worth remembering this and demanding some moderation.
25115 11 This type of money giving away creates inflation. The term ""Putininflation"" is a manipulation, because the war in Ukraine only deepened certain processes. Similarly, the president is right when he says that we had no influence on the emergence of the coronavirus, but he does not add that we already had a decisive influence, or rather those in power, on the introduction of lockdowns that caused gigantic inflation. The call to grit your teeth in this context is impudence similar to the situation where we first cut someone's salary and then call him to save. The problem is that the milk has been spilled and it will be difficult for the government to stop the tsunami it caused. Unfortunately, radical action is needed, such as raising interest rates, and everyone suffers, especially the poorest. Let the president at least not say it's not the government's fault. For this is not true.
25121 1 Success of the Ukrainian army. They destroyed a Russian ammunition depot. Summary of the night
25121 3rd The Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation post of the 785th detachment of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition warehouses and the Fagot anti-tank missile complex, the operational command of ""South"" reported. In turn, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Wereshchuk, almost 800,000 people internally displaced people will need housing, see what else happened last night!"
25121	5	Almost 800,000 Ukrainian citizens lost their homes
25121	7	- Nearly 800,000 Internally displaced people will need housing and everything is being done to provide them with a place to live and spend the winter, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Wereszczuk on Sunday.
25121	9	— As for the need for temporary housing, almost 800 thousand. Ukrainian citizens lost their homes. The government has prepared modular construction programs in this regard, supported by the Ministry of Regions, which has the appropriate funds for their implementation. As you know, these are joint programs with the Polish government, other governments are also involved in them, the first modular cities have already been created, but it is definitely not enough - said Iryna Wereszczuk.
25121	11	"She noted that she witnessed a situation in the Chernihiv region where people did not really want to live in modular cities because they had previously lived in their own private buildings. They said, we want ""at least one room, but in your garden"". ""But it can't be guaranteed yet,"" said Wereszczuk."
25121	13	Mayor Słowiańska: there will be no heating season in the city
25121	15	The mayor of Słowiańska, Wadym Lach, announced on Sunday that due to the war, it would not be possible to start the heating season in the city with the onset of cold weather.
25121	17	"""Currently, there is no water or gas in Sloviansk, and electricity is supplied intermittently due to the proximity of high-voltage power lines to the war zone,"" Vadym Lakh, the mayor of the city, told Donbass News. He added that in such conditions, it will not be possible to start the heating season with the onset of cold weather."
25121	19	He stressed that the inhabitants of Słowiańsk should evacuate, as the attempts to capture the city by the Russian army will continue.
25121	21	The Armed Forces destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an observation post
25121	23	"The Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation post of the 785th detachment of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two ammunition depots and the ""Fagot"" anti-tank missile complex, Ukrainian Pravda reported on Monday on the basis of a report from the ""South"" operational command."
25121	25	"According to Monday's report from the ""South"" command, 66 Russians, five tanks, two Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers, three armored vehicles and nine cars were liquidated."
25121	27	The Armed Forces also destroyed the Merlin-VR drone near Ivanovka, where the Russians were trying to carry out aerial reconnaissance.
25121	29	"The Ukrainian air force made five strikes on enemy positions. In particular, 3 enemy positions in the Berysław district were attacked. Pairs of Mi-8 and Mi-24 fighters destroyed 2 enemy positions in the Kherson region, reports OK ""South""."
25127	1	ORDO IURIS TERRORISTS
25127	3	"The biggest hit of the 2020s is ""hybrid warfare"". The hybrid war against Poland is waged by Putin, Lukashenka, but also by Brussels. We hear about hybrid war almost every day, the fashion for hybrid war dominated our politics. And I wanted to speak up about old-school terrorism."
25127	5	"According to the European Commission, terrorism is ""any deliberate act committed by individuals or organizations against states, their institutions or populations with the aim of intimidation"". The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adds that it is an action motivated by ""extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism or irrational and subjective factors, aimed at creating a climate of terror among public figures, specific individuals or groups in society or society as a whole."""
25127	7	"In accordance with these definitions, I request that the Pro-Prawo do Życia Foundation and the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture, as well as Kai Godek, be included in the EU list of persons, groups and entities that are subject to sanctions due to their participation in terrorist acts. That's a start, although there should be room for a few other ""pro-lifers"" on the list as well. Whose action is undoubtedly focused on ""intimidation"", as well as ""creating a climate of terror"" among ""a specific group"" - medics, especially those related to gynecology and obstetrics, but not only - and is undoubtedly motivated by ""extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism and irrational subjective factors. And also - although this condition is no longer in the definition - it causes the death of innocent people."
25127	9	"For the record: no one who is not a spiritual brother of Kai Godek has any doubts that the high-profile death of a pregnant woman in a hospital in Pszczyna is a direct result of the decision of the Przyłębska tribunal on the ban on ""eugenic abortion"". There is no room for interpretation here: the fetus had congenital defects, additionally there was oligohydramnios - that is, it was damaged - before it could be removed, now it is not; if it had been removed in time, the woman would most likely be alive. And so she died. So much."
25127	11	But in the context of terrorism, the second aspect is more important - abortion to save a woman's health and life. Theoretically still acceptable. According to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, three hundred legal abortions were performed in Poland after the Przyłębska tribunal's verdict was announced - that is, abortions to save the mother's life and health. That's 15 times more than before. Which means that there are brave doctors in Poland who put the well-being of their patients above their comfort and safety. Nevertheless, as the opponents of tightening the anti-abortion law repeat over and over again, the state has no right to demand heroism from its citizens. Nor from women who are forced to make terrible sacrifices for the fetus; nor from doctors who, by deciding to terminate a pregnancy, risk their professional future and perhaps their freedom today. And here we enter the area of ​​intimidation.
25127	13	As rightly noted by Prof. Marzena Dębska, gynecologist, you never know who will be the author of the expert opinion in a possible disciplinary or criminal case related to termination of pregnancy to save a woman's life. And medicine differs from mathematics in that the same numbers - e.g. the CPR indicator informing about inflammation - can be interpreted differently. As already seriously life-threatening - that is, justifying treatment by fetal abortion - or not yet at all. No one doubts that if Ziobro's prosecutor's office decided to conduct a show trial of a doctor accused of unlawful termination of pregnancy, it would find experts like Prof. Chazan, famous for forcing women to give birth to babies without heads. Prof. Mariusz Zimmer, president of the Polish Society of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, points out that among people graduating from medicine, there are no candidates for this otherwise very lucrative specialization. Too much of a risk. In a word: doctors are intimidated.
25127	15	"The line of attack of integrists towards cases such as those from Pszczyna can be clearly seen in the statement of attorney Magdalena Majkowska from Ordo Iuris, who, knowing the case only from the media, did not fail to go to television and announce that the drama was the result of medical malpractice. Because ""doctors are not afraid to terminate a pregnancy to save the mother's life and health"", so if one of them does not terminate when necessary, it is his fault. Let him be afraid."
25127	17	"However, it is difficult to find an act of intimidation more spectacular than the civic initiative submitted by the Pro - Right to Life Foundation and written by Ordo Iuris, hiding under the enigmatic name ""amending the Criminal Code Act and some other acts"". This is the famous project that abolishes the anti-abortion law and equates abortion with murder. The rapporteur of the project is Mariusz Dzierżawski, and his deputy Łukasz Jończyk - and they should also be included in the list of terrorists, because the mere submission of such a project is unquestionably oriented towards creating a climate of terror."
25128	1	FUCK OUT, BUT WHERE?
25128	3	"Among the many banners present at the anti-PiS protests, one in particular caught the eye - with a concise slogan: ""Get the fuck out!"". However, this issue is more complicated than it may seem – and requires clarification. Fuck off, but who? Kaczynski himself? The whole PiS? With or without youth? And Solidarna Polska, Gowin's sofa and the Confederation can stay?"
25128	5	Another, perhaps even more difficult, issue is where to get the fuck out. Mass emigration, especially in the era of COVIDU, seems difficult to meet. According to party data, PiS currently has over 40,000 members - this number has increased by half during the previous term alone. So where to send these people? And who would want them?
25128	7	"It's easy to shout ""Get the fuck out!"", but what then, no one thinks about it anymore. In order to check whether this beautiful political slogan translates into practice, I decided to analyze the exports of only one person from Poland: the president of PiS. He enjoys such authority on the right that if he leaves alone, the rest will inevitably follow him."
25128	10	1. Russia
25128	12	"I have read all the biographies of the deputy prime minister available on the market and a sad picture emerges from them. Jarosław went abroad only once – as an 18-year-old on the Black Sea in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, even with this trip he was not satisfied. In the interview-rival ""About two such ... Alphabet of the Kaczyński brothers"" Kaczyński recalls the hot summer holidays: ""Supplies at a catastrophic level. A few years earlier, they ate bread with sawdust (...) After returning to Poland, we had the impression that we were returning to the zone of freedom and wealth.'"
25128	14	Some time has passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia has become a prized retirement home for fallen warlords. For example, Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian ex-president, is retiring there, sentenced in absentia to 13 years in prison in his homeland.
25128	16	Unfortunately, relations between Putin and Kaczyński are not the best. When Jarosław was prime minister in 2006-2007, the gentlemen never met. In 2010, as is known, Putin murdered Kaczyński's brother, who was going to Russia on a guest visit. This is not the best land for cohabitation. Although it is worth adding that on the upper Volga there is already the city of Yaroslavl, with over 600,000 inhabitants, named after another wise Yaroslav - Prince Yaroslav the Wise.
25128	18	Kaczyński's nature is also such that he would immediately start to work with Putin, and although it is a great country, one dictator has been enough for him for years. Even if Kaczyński managed to provoke another revolution in Russia, which was already favorable to Poland in regaining independence, it does not seem realistic that this man mentally close to the Bolsheviks would be able to get on a horse and reach the border.
25128	20	"Another, no less important barrier is language. The president is not ""panimajet, are you gavarish"". If we add to this the fact that the PiS elite might feel some historically justified anxiety before traveling deep into this heavily forested country, it becomes clear that Jarosław may go to Russia not to emigrate, but at most for tea."
25128	24	2. England
25128	26	"The most popular emigration destination among Poles. It would suit Kaczyński, if only in this respect, that he could try to create another government-in-exile in history and through it issue decrees, award orders and pretend to exercise real power. The president, however, had been to the Thames before and, to put it mildly, did not like it. In November 1989, the authorities of the Civic Parliamentary Club ordered him to go to London to mobilize English politicians and the local Polish community in the matter of recognizing the Polish-German border. In the book ""Agreement against monopoly"", the president recalls: ""I had problems with passport control at the airport. Despite my diplomatic passport, I was asked what I wanted to do and where to live. I struggled to answer something (…). I returned to Poland with some relief."
25128	28	A year later, Kaczyński made another flight to England - this time, however, he did not even leave the airport. He immediately went to Warsaw on the return plane with Ryszard Kaczorowski, who decided to return the insignia of the head of state of the Second Polish Republic.
25128	30	"It took 20 years for the next visit to the queen's country. In June 2010, as PiS's presidential candidate, Kaczyński paid a visit to Prime Minister David Cameron. The cameras captured the British man's polite greeting and Kaczynski's reaction: the words ""aj dont anderstend"", combined with panicky waving of hands and searching for an interpreter."
25128	32	On March 22, 2017, Kaczyński went to London for the last time to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and discuss Brexit. However, because of the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge, he had to stay overnight in London. It's not - you'll admit - a memory you want to come back to.
25128	34	Among the advantages of staying in England, Kaczyński could undoubtedly mention the fact that this country has ceased to belong to the European Union, which imposes its opinion on Poland as regards the rule of law and human rights. In addition, Kaczyński, who failed in high school from class to class with a B in English, he could come across numerous Poles in the UK and open his mouth in the only language he knew. However, there is a risk that among the compatriots there could be people unfavorable to the president - for example pro-abortion activists who protested in large numbers last week in front of the embassy in London. And he would at least end up bruised.
2514	1	Can COVID vaccinations be mandatory? Legal opinion of the HFHR
2514	3	A parliamentary draft bill providing for the introduction of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 is awaiting consideration in the Sejm. “The current epidemic situation may justify extending the obligation of preventive vaccinations to include vaccinations against COVID-19. Such a step would be important for protecting the health of people who cannot be vaccinated, as well as for guaranteeing effective access to healthcare for people who suffer from diseases other than COVID-19.
2514	5	Duty of the authorities
2514	7	In its opinion, the HFHR pointed out that the constitution imposes an obligation on public authorities to combat infectious diseases, although it does not specify in detail how this should be implemented.
2514	9	Mandatory vaccination against specific epidemic diseases may be a way to fulfill this obligation, and this solution has been used by the authorities for at least a dozen or so years. In its opinion, the HFHR reminds that in Poland the vaccination order applies to as many as 14 diseases and so far the constitutionality of such obligations has not been challenged. Importantly, the already functioning act allows for the obligation to include protective vaccinations against coronavirus. The adoption of a separate act on this subject would dispel any doubts regarding the legality of the obligation formulated in this way, guaranteeing its better enforcement.
2514	11	Vaccinations and personal freedom
2514	13	The obligation to vaccinate interferes with an individual's personal freedom and his or her right to respect for private life. However, these rights are not absolute. Under certain conditions and on certain terms, they may be limited.
2514	15	In this regard, the Constitution requires that such restrictions be established only by statute and only when they are necessary in a democratic state to protect specific values. These include the health, rights and freedoms of others, and public order.
2514	17	Strasbourg Court: Mandatory vaccinations do not violate rights
2514	19	The obligation to vaccinate has also recently been the subject of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. In the case of Vavřička and others v. the Czech Republic, he found that compulsory vaccination was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, he outlined a number of circumstances that should be taken into account when assessing whether vaccination against a particular disease should become mandatory.
2514	21	It is worth emphasizing that the Polish government also submitted its opinion on this matter, in which it indicated that the obligation to vaccinate as such does not violate the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.
2514	23	The epidemic situation requires action
2514	25	In the light of the criteria outlined by the ECtHR, it should be recognized that the current epidemic situation may justify extending the obligation of preventive vaccination to include vaccination against COVID-19. “Another, alternative solution to counteract the pandemic could be to introduce further restrictions on the freedom of movement, the right to education, and the freedom to conduct business. At the same time, it would be highly debatable to claim that such measures would be less burdensome than the obligation to undergo preventive vaccinations,” the HFHR notes in its opinion.
25140	1	CANON MEAT IN STOCK
25140	3	The Red Army is apparently green. In fighting. Soldiers fight without conviction and kill only out of habit. The maneuvers of the Russian gang in this war resemble scenes from a comedy about military cunts. And now the Gypsies will support their tank, and now they will fire at their own positions, the tanks are standing because they ran out of fuel, and the soldiers are giving up because they have run out of supplies and have not eaten for three days. The myth of the great Russian army fell like Napoleon at Waterloo.
25140	5	The only successes that Russian troops have been recorded in shelling apartment blocks and killing civilians. It is easy to hit civilians, because there are a lot of them, and the army has no scruples, just like ethical values. Ukraine was supposed to be occupied in three days, meanwhile three weeks pass and the successes are similar to those of Polish athletes at the Chinese Olympics. Oh, there will be no medals for this war.
25140	7	Unfortunately, Putin does not take into account losses at all and will send more soldiers to certain death. A man in Russian war tactics is nothing. “We have a lot of people here,” Stalin is said to have said. During the Second World War, the so-called combat reconnaissance. Troops with the Nazis in front and NKVD platoons in the back were moving towards the fortified German positions. These troops were sent to some slaughter, but it was about discovering German firing positions, which were then bombed.
25140	9	Putin so-called he started the second Chechen war with a provocation. In 1999, in Moscow, Ryazan and Volgodonsk, special services blew up apartment blocks. It happened at night and in the morning. Several hundred sleeping citizens died. Chechen separatists were accused of the attacks, and then it was Putin who famously said that we would catch them and even drown them in the toilet, which appealed to the nation that wanted revenge. Today it is known that Putin's services were behind the attacks, and that the blowing up of the apartments was a provocation to justify the slaughter in Chechnya.
25141	3	It's louder than firing a cannon. It's eloquent and rings in your ears like three alarm clocks at once.
25141	5	When there were black umbrella protests. She was silent. When there were women's protests with hangers. She was silent. When the police beat women during the Women's Strike. She was silent. When nurses and carers of the disabled protested. She was silent.
25141	7	When the police took 15-year-olds to police stations for shouting vulgar words at demonstrations. She was silent. When children from Michałów were taken to swamps and forests. She was silent.
25141	9	I saw a video of her reading fairy tales to children at the royal castle in Warsaw. It suits her. Husband Andrzej also tells fairy tales. And not only in the castle, but all the time. Maybe Agata should read something about women's rights after all?
25141	11	Now, when, as a result of the activities of the lobby of religious fanatics and the decision of the Tribunal by Cook Przyłębska, regulations were introduced on a complete ban on abortion, even in the case of rape or life-threatening, a young girl from Pszczyna dies, she also remains silent.
25141	13	And she could make even a small gesture. After all, he comes from a good Krakow family. Families of sensitive poets. When, on the day of the premiere of the propaganda film Smolensk, she went to see another film, it was perceived almost as a demonstration of independence. But she never was and never will be.
25141	15	Chic clothes and elegance will not cover the lack of class and heart. Cold, calculating, predictable like German grammar exercises.
25141	17	She had the deal of the century in her life. By chance, her husband, a man without a backbone, with the mentality of a junior high school student and the appearance of Mr. Bean, became president, and she became the First Lady.
25141	19	She will not spoil her job when some woman from a small town far from Warsaw, a woman whom she does not know, dies as a result of a stupid law. She will not spoil the comfort of living in the presidential palace while some women suffer, fight for their rights and are beaten.
25141	21	And now it's the second term. No one will take Andrzej off his job. And for the second time, he cannot run for the seat in the Palace. So she could at least sympathize.
25141	23	"There is a saying that you need money and looks to be ""Mr."" All it takes to be a First Lady is to have a heart. As you can see, it was missing."
25143	1	Trouble getting there, or the President's Traveling Circus
25143	3	Anyone who has ever had a new car knows that for the first few thousand kilometers you must not saw the car and press the accelerator pedal. The new car has to arrive.
25143	5	Jarosław Kaczyński is not a newbie in politics, but rather a sharply beaten rattler. And yet, he has access problems.
25143	7	Poles have problems with reaching Jaroslaw, who are hindered from entering his supposedly open meetings. The accelerator pedal in this case is pressed hard by the police, who chase away all citizens who want to tell the President what they think about him.
25143	9	Recently, in Kórnik, at a meeting with the local community, only previously marked individuals brought in by coaches were allowed, while the locals were blocked by reinforced police forces.
25143	11	Reaching Jarosław was like forcing a fortified castle. Police cars and armed to the teeth policemen protecting the nation's savior is a sight to which everyone has already become accustomed. A certain novelty were the mounted police units that practiced police rodeo, scaring those who wanted to meet Jarosław.
25143	13	Security specialists say that if the temperature of the President's Traveling Circus increases at the same pace as recently, neither horse patrols nor cavalry charges with police cars will be enough. We will have to strengthen the protection with combat vehicles, tanks, and perhaps rocket launchers. Military experts say that trenches and barbed wire fences will have to be built for the next meetings of the President. Anti-personnel mines can also come in handy.
25143	15	A large amount of equipment has recently been purchased in connection with the war in Ukraine, so this will not be a problem. The only question is whether it is not cheaper to hold meetings with the local community in the offices on Nowogrodzka Street, since the roles of locals are played by hired actors and extras anyway? Each time, only send a TVP crew that, masked and with mustaches, will film a few pictures from a given town and such material will be added to a beautiful report from local visits to Jarozbawa.
25148	1	Silver for Sunday (because silence is golden)
25148	3	Uncompromising Simon
25148	5	The uncompromising Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Polska2050, has always criticized the rule of the United Right. He also wrote negatively about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, it turned out that the Dobra Fabryka foundation founded by him in 2020 received PLN 680,000 in subsidies from the same ministry. He probably took it with disgust, but he took it anyway. One thing I'm curious about though: what did he get them for? Maybe for an equally critical attitude towards the Civic Platform and its presidential candidate?
25148	7	The successes of the Polish Order
25148	9	"Politicians from the United Right promised Polish teachers a noticeable increase in earnings, while at the beginning of January, educators rubbed their eyes in amazement at the amounts that had been credited to their accounts. It turned out that their salaries are several hundred zlotys lower than in December. One day, the Minister of Education and Science, Przemysław Czarnek, accused the journalist of lying in connection with questions about lower teachers' salaries after the introduction of the Polish Deal. He argued that it was ""certainly not because of the Polish Order, but because of other reasons."" The next day, however, government spokesman Piotr Mueller admitted that lower wages had been paid and apologized for ""legislative inaccuracies"". In the end, even the prime minister apologized for the mistakes and promised to fix them with a new regulation. The problem is that, as lawyers unanimously claim, laws cannot be changed by ordinances. But who would care about such trifles when repairing this flagship work, after all, in our beautiful country the law means little, unless it is paired with justice..."
25148	11	Once is not enough!
25148	13	Even before the New Year, the Kraśnik bypass was opened for the first time. It took place with the modest assistance of local government officials from PiS, public television and with the participation of Jarosław Trzecirski (PiS), the marshal of the Lubelskie Voivodeship. But once is not enough! A few days later, the traffic on the already completed road was stopped and the ceremonial ribbon-cutting took place again. This time with the participation of Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin and ministers of: infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk, funds and regional policy Grzegorz Puda, education and science Przemysław Czarnek and deputy finance minister Piotr Patkowski. Almost 60 people were invited to the second, much grander opening, including the same local government officials as last week. I wonder if they didn't have déjà vu during that second party...
25148	15	Dura lex, sed lex
25148	17	Do you remember how during the protests of the Women's Strike in connection with the tightening of the anti-abortion law, a certain nineteen-year-old police officer broke her arm? The girl filed a lawsuit against the police. Well, recently, after a year of consideration, this case ended in discontinuation. Meanwhile, the suspect of painting anti-government and anti-church slogans on the façade of St. Krzyża was placed in pre-trial detention for three months at the request of the prosecutor's office. However, Polish criminal law is a real jungle, full of secrets and surprises, because according to it, it turned out that writing with a spray on a wall is more dangerous for society than violence and bodily harm.
25154	1	Kraska: we have 599 new infections. The number of infections is falling
25154	3	"The number of coronavirus infections in Poland is decreasing week by week. Last Monday, there were 618 new cases. Today, according to the words of Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraska, COVID-19 was confirmed in 599. ""This is, if we compare week to week, a decrease of 2 percent, which is less week to week"" — summed up the politician in an interview with TVP."
25154	5	Infections are reduced by 2% week to week.
25154	7	The Ministry of Health publishes data on new infections or deaths in connection with COVID-19 every day. They are published at 10.30. On August 8, however, we learned the latest data in advance. Information about the infections on Monday morning was provided by Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraska.
25154	9	– Today it is 599 cases [COVID-19], which is, if we compare week to week, a decrease of 2 percent, which is less week to week. These are small numbers, because these are the numbers from the weekend, but if we look at the statistics and also the surroundings of our country, i.e. Western European countries, but also the Czech Republic, Slovakia, we see a downward wave everywhere, i.e. this summer wave of coronavirus is definitely weaker - said Waldemar Kraska on TVP.
25154	11	Epidemic situation in Poland — data from August 7
25154	13	The day before, on August 7, 2022, the Ministry of Health reported 698 new coronavirus infections. Most cases were recorded in the province Mazowieckie (105), Śląskie (78) and Lesser Poland (61). Seven people infected with COVID-19 have recovered. No deaths were recorded on that day.
25162	1	The Chinese military continues exercises around Taiwan
25162	3	The Chinese military continues to conduct exercises in the seas and airspace around Taiwan on Monday, the eastern theater command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) announced on social media.
25162	5	"The army will conduct ""practical exercises in sea and air space"". Chinese soldiers to train in attacking submarines, said in a statement posted on the Weibo platform."
25162	7	China has been conducting unprecedented military exercises in the waters and airspace surrounding Taiwan since Thursday. Some of the maneuvers take place just 20 km from the Taiwanese coast. The maneuvers are in response to the recent visit of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Taipei, against which Beijing strongly protested. Initially, it was reported that the exercises would end on Sunday.
25167	1	The Great Barrier Reef is great in more than name. She just stood up to climate change
25167	3	Is it possible nowadays to write something optimistic and positive about climate change and the coral reef? Counter-intuitively, it turns out to be. This is really surprisingly good news
25167	5	"According to scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, the Great Barrier Reef is currently the largest in almost 40 years. Such a ""rebirth"", which covers as much as 2/3 of the Great Barrier Reef's surface, probably no one expected."
25167	7	It is well known that climate change, the constant heating of ocean waters expose corals sensitive to temperature and sunlight to really difficult conditions for development. Increasingly frequent heat waves, and thus increases in sea temperature, cause the so-called the bleaching of the coral reef, leading to the gradual death of this fascinating ecosystem.
25167	9	The coral reef is slowly recovering
25167	11	All the more surprising is the process described by scientists in the report taking place in the northern and central regions of the Great Barrier Reef. It seems that the corals decided to fight for survival. Oceanographers have not seen such an intensive reconstruction process for decades.
25167	13	Considering that the process of warming the atmosphere is progressing at an accelerating pace, it is especially pleasing that the bleaching of the coral reef in 2020 and 2022 is not as intense as it was 5-6 years ago. This, in turn, means that the corals are better able to cope with the conditions in the ocean and are able to rebuild themselves.
25167	15	Of course, we are talking here about a big step in the right direction, but there is still a long way to full success. Researchers indicate that in the central part of the Great Barrier Reef, live corals reached 33 percent, and in the northern region as much as 36 percent. It may not seem like much, but it is already an increase that restores hope that corals can recover and come back to life. If this trend continues in the coming years, and the episodes of reef bleaching become a little less frequent, perhaps the magnificent coral reef, which is one of the most unique marine ecosystems on Earth, can return to its full glory and save thousands of species from extinction. rely.
25171	1	"in ""Wiadomości"" TVP! How Tusk and the Germans ""invented mercury"""
25171	3	One thing we can be sure of: as long as PiS is in power, nothing can be explained in a definitive and credible way. We will hear the story that will do the least damage to the government.
25171	5	"The main editions of TVP's ""Wiadomości"" on Monday and Tuesday (August 15-16) had a clear message about the ecological disaster on the Oder River: the situation is under control, and the ""total opposition"" inspired by Germany is lying about mercury in the river. Tusk's metaphors about the ""dormant state of PiS"" and ""PiS, which is like mercury"", are empty slander against the authorities, who cannot be accused of anything in the case of the Oder River."
25171	7	"""Wiadomości"" from August 15 was a solemn and religious occasional program (Polish Army Day). learn from Danuta Holecka herself that the Mother of God appeared to Russian soldiers twice, defending them from entering Warsaw. This vision caused panic in the Bolshevik ranks. In addition, on the occasion of the Christmas concert in Elbląg, the digging of the Vistula Spit was praised to the skies - not only as an investment in Poland's independence, but also as a great economic venture. Journalists of public television have no doubts - even on the latter issue."
25171	9	TVP. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride
25171	11	"It is very difficult to find yourself in this characteristic infantile-militaristic aesthetics and rhetoric for someone who has not been brought up on the Russian-Asian models of public life. Older Poles remember it from the People's Republic of Poland and probably some people like it. You know, youth. And those who do not remember the People's Republic of Poland may associate the style of Jacek Kurski's television with China or other countries of the East. Some of this comes to us through movies and movies. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride... But do we really have to go to Asia? Does Jacek Kurski, producing his ""Wiadomości"" for President Kaczyński, see him as little Xi Jinping? By the way, an interesting clue: Jarosław Kaczyński's Asian features. I throw the ball - let the sinologists catch it."
25171	13	In any case, the psychological profile of the president of Poland in the eyes of the president of TVP will remain a secret of the latter, although Mr. Kurski must be admired for professionalism in the craft of propaganda and great dedication to the work of staying on a stool, from which several other gentlemen would gladly push him.
25171	15	But let's go back to the Oder. The message from Tuesday, August 16, was much more extensive. A lot of specific information was given, which we also know from other media. How many water samples were taken, what could have happened (as we know, it is not known yet), how many dead fish were caught. First of all, it was reported (apparently true) that the situation was improving.
25171	17	"There was also mention of restocking the Oder, for which (as Prime Minister Morawiecki assured on Tuesday) there will be funds. In general, according to the ""Wiadomości"" material, nothing that big happened, and the cause of the disaster - although not fully known - is probably related to the low water level, which, after all, causes various ecological problems not only in Poland. I would like to add here that in the flood of journalistic materials about the Oder disaster, very little is said about how this water level actually developed. It seems he wasn't that low again. There is also almost no mention of retention reservoirs and sluices, i.e. whether the possibilities of dilution of the Oder waters were used. This topic will probably come back again."
25171	19	Tusk compares PiS to mercury
25171	21	"Meanwhile, we watch Tuesday's ""News"". Immediately after the material about the Oder, maintained in a rather matter-of-fact tone, there was a real outburst of hate against Donald Tusk. Here the ""total opposition"" uses the misfortune of the ecological catastrophe for a dirty political war, which it wages hand in hand with Germany. The weapon in this war was disinformation about the alleged presence of mercury in the Oder, which is not confirmed. PO floods the country with an ""avalanche of lies"", and it's in his blood. Suffice it to recall that Prime Minister Kopacz said that she had no money for any 500 plus, and at the same time Tusk announced that he would introduce a similar program. As you can see, he's a cheater. He once raised the retirement age, and now he wants a four-day workday..."
25171	23	"Although I can't keep up with the four-day workday myself, but when it comes to PiS as a dead fish and comparing it to mercury, these epithets don't seem very exuberant - regardless of how many mercury compounds are finally detected or not detected. The insinuation that the PO and the Germans ""invented mercury"" is absurd. The news about mercury appeared in the German media, and at the same time, the Marshal of the Lubuskie Province, Elżbieta Polak, heard about it from Alex Vogel, the Minister of the Environment of Brandenburg. Probably some mercury compound was detected somewhere, but this was not confirmed in subsequent samples. Tusk used the comparison of PiS with mercury when the ""mercury hypothesis"" was still relevant. The hypothesis has already passed into history, but the metaphor has not lost its relevance - and for many reasons."
25171	25	"The opposition does not accuse the authorities of allowing one or another chemical compound to be found in the Oder River (perhaps the time will come for such accusations as well), but that it did not react on time. And that's the key thing. This is what the game is about and this is where the government's PR strategy focuses. This is shown by the press conferences of dignitaries, which took place on Tuesday, August 16. After a very professional and detailed message from the ministers of the environment and infrastructure, journalists began to ask about the date of intervention by the central institutions. Questions remained unanswered, and the conference official unceremoniously ""quenched"" them. It was obvious that the subject of the delay was reserved for the ""top"" itself (because the Prime Minister spoke about it when dismissing two high officials), while ministers Moscow and Adamczyk were not to comment on this extremely sensitive matter."
25171	27	PiS is moving forward
25171	29	The ostentatious refusal to answer is a fatal strategy. However, literally hour by hour, a fundamental change took place in her. At the conference of the Lower Silesian Voivode, Jarosław Obrębski (PiS) and his deputy, numerous details regarding the chronology of events were presented. The explanation for the several-day delay in decisive action in Lower Silesia, given by the local PiS authorities, was that after the first signals about numerous dead fish, the situation improved, and only after a few days its radical deterioration. Thus, the reactions of the authorities were proportionate and corresponded to the development of the situation. This is an announcement of a new PiS narrative. Yes, there were delays, but they were justified by the dynamics of the course of the disaster.
25173	3	"Pro-government media and PiS politicians considered yesterday's statement by the German minister as proof of the ""lies"" of Marshal Elżbieta Polak about the presence of mercury in the Oder river. Throughout Monday, propaganda distracted attention from the slow reaction of the Polish government to the contamination of the river"
25173	5	At the end of the day on Monday, it turned out that German measurements did indeed show mercury in the water, but it was not taken from the main stream of the river and it is already known that it is not responsible for the death of fish. Still, three weeks after the first signals about the Odra catastrophe, it is not known what is killing the river.
25173	7	However, August 15 was the day of mercury and Prime Minister Morawiecki could accuse Donald Tusk of fake news at a press conference on the Oder River.
25173	9	Root lost in translation
25173	11	The information that mercury salt can kill Odra appeared at the end of the week. It was repeated by PO activists, referring to the first German analyses.
25173	13	"Marshal Elżbieta Polak tweeted a photo from a videoconference with the German minister and wrote that the latter ""in a direct conversation"" admitted that ""the concentration of mercury in the Oder River was so high that it was impossible to determine the scale."" Thus, she confirmed the reports of the German radio and television RBB, which was the first to publicly announce information about mercury in the river."
25173	15	The mercury scandal started on Sunday for good, because the government propaganda made it the main problem of the Odra River and argued that it was false information spread by the opposition. It began after joint Polish-German consultations and a press conference on the situation on the Oder River on Sunday, August 14, 2022. It was to be the beginning of a new, better cooperation of both countries to determine the causes of the ecological disaster. Instead, we brushed against a diplomatic scandal.
25173	17	A TVP journalist asked the German delegation whether mercury was actually found in the samples from the river, according to Marshal Polak.
25173	19	"“The Marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship tweeted on Friday that you had personally confirmed to her that the concentration of mercury in the Oder River was so high that it was impossible to determine the scale. I wanted to ask you if you said such words, on what basis and why” – that was the question. But, as we wrote in OKO.press, the Polish translator who forwarded the question to Axel Vogel, Minister of Agriculture and Environment of the German state of Brandenburg, asked him if Marshal Pole said that the Oder River was ""caustic"". He missed the mercury issue."
25173	21	"Vogel replied that ""such a statement is not known to him."" ""We have reported that the pH is very high and we cannot explain why this is the case,"" he added."
25173	23	But although the question was mistranslated, the Polish pro-government media believed that the minister denied it. And they started a campaign against Elżbieta Polak.
25173	25	Sharp words for quotes were provided by PiS politicians on Twitter.
25173	27	“After this statement by the German minister, it is reasonable to suspect that Elżbieta Polak misinformed the public about the situation on the Oder in a crisis situation. In my opinion, this should be clarified by the relevant services,” wrote Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Paweł Szefernaker on Sunday evening.
25173	29	"""Well, it's quite a scandal. So the marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship invented mercury? Maybe to divert attention from the problems in her WORD?” – Maciej Wąsik, also the deputy head of the Ministry of Interior and Administration, echoed him."
25173	31	“The case is obvious. The official position of Germany is known,” commented the Deputy Minister of Climate and Environment, Jacek Dekora.
25173	33	"""Marshal of the Lubuski »disinformed the public« about mercury?” – this question appeared on the main page of the TVP.info portal on Monday noon. Similar titles appeared on the portals wPolityce.pl and Polska Times."
25173	35	Germans amazed
25173	37	"“This is outrageous! I was asked by the interpreter about the alleged quote from me that the water in the Oder can burn your hands. I responded to this and explained the pH values. I wasn't asked about mercury levels,"" Vogel tweeted this morning."
25173	39	He attached the screenshots shared by one of the Twitter users to the post, showing how the pro-government Polish media uses Vogel's statement to deny the alleged fake news of Marshal Pole.
25173	41	As it turned out, the German minister did not hear the question about mercury at the conference, so he could not deny anything.
25173	43	"However, the pro-government media managed to redirect attention to this kind of ""success"" of the authorities - the lack of mercury in the river. Thousands of dead fish, the contamination of the Oder River and the government's sluggishness in reacting to the ecological catastrophe have faded into the background."
25173	45	The mercury was there, but it's not what kills
25173	47	We still don't know what killed thousands of fish in the Oder. Polish and German studies so far indicate high water salinity, increased - alkaline - pH and increased oxygen concentration.
25173	49	"The e-mail sent to OKO.press from the Ministry of the Environment of Brandenburg showed that the level of mercury is still being checked. In this context, Saturday's announcement by climate minister Anna Moscow, in which she assures that Germany has not found the presence of mercury in water, seemed premature (At the press conference on Sunday, the minister informed that Poland was ""carrying out work on identifying the source"")."
25173	51	"“To date, none of the studies have confirmed the presence of toxic substances. We also conduct fish research. We have completed testing for mercury and heavy metals - they were not found in the samples. In the near future, we will check another 300 indicators,"" Moscow said on Sunday."
25173	53	On Monday afternoon, the German authorities summed up the meeting with the Polish side.
25173	55	Minister Axel Vogel confirmed that he had warned Elżbieta Polak that a high concentration of mercury was detected in the first sample examined by the Germans. In a conversation with the marshal, however, he was to add that the sample could be an anomaly and the tests should be repeated.
25173	57	Subsequent samples were to give results within or slightly above environmental tolerance.
25173	59	Vogel said he didn't think mercury was the cause of the fish dying. Because this element accumulates in living organisms for a long time.
25173	61	"""We're wandering in the dark, we're researching insecticides, pesticides, all kinds of substances,"" Vogel admitted."
25173	63	"In the evening, German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke said that while research is still ongoing and it is still unknown what poisoned the river, ""mercury does not appear to be the cause of fish mortality"". Lemke's spokesman, Urlich Schulte, told Polsat News that ""mercury has not been detected either in the dead fish or in the water itself. So today we can rule that out."""
25173	65	On the other hand, the Polish Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection admitted that German samples taken in oxbow lakes of the Oder River and its tributaries contained mercury. On the other hand, Polish research in the main stream of the river did not show mercury, and the State Veterinary Inspection ruled out mercury as the cause of fish death.
25173	67	dead fish in the Gliwice canal
25173	69	Min. Vogel also emphasized that the German side should have received information about the contamination of the Oder River near Wrocław on July 28. “But that didn't happen. We were surprised,” he lamented.
25173	71	“The first fish kills in Brandenburg were spotted on August 9. We had no warning from Poland,” spokesman Schulte said. And it was two weeks after the information about contamination of the Oder appeared in Poland. Earlier, anglers reported dead fish in the Gliwice Canal.
25176	1	Pisowska eco-omert
25176	3	They are going in denial about the Odra. The opposition is rightly pressing for details. It's a whole avalanche of questions. On the parliamentary committee and in the media. If they answered honestly, as it was, there would be a chance for the cooperation of political forces. But they didn't read Bartoszewski or Kotarbiński that it's worth being decent, and if you don't know what to say, you tell the truth. They clearly don't know what to say, and they don't want to tell the truth. So the old way: instead of explaining, they attack those who want explanations.
25176	5	There is no information vacuum in the age of the internet. If they are not telling the truth, the void is filled with speculation. So there is information about who poisoned the Oder. I'm not repeating because it's not verified. On Wednesday, however, a key question was asked at the commission: do you want to hide the perpetrator and the reasons for the Oder conspiracy of silence in Kaczyński's camp? If that were the case, the current government's evasions would gain coherence: they know, but they have a huge problem, so they lie and swindle, stall, look for catchy substitute topics.
25176	7	Whatever the final findings will be - poisoning crime or natural causes, i.e. force majeure - the Odra case also has two positives. Firstly, citizens can see the condition of the state financed from their taxes under Kaczyński's rule. Secondly, many Poles will open their eyes to the truth that nature must be taken care of, because it will not defend itself against the predatory exploitation of its resources under the cover of bad governance.
25176	9	"Misrule mocks ""environmentalism"" as well as other alleged ""leftist"" ideologies. That is why Kaczyński ignored the Oder disaster during a trip to Ruda Śląska. He was silent, because maybe he knew the truth about her from the beginning. But also so as not to give the PiS concrete the impression that the opposition's questions deserve an answer at all. On the contrary: we want to know what the Polish Waters are for, why there is no constant monitoring of rivers, what is the government's idea to save the Oder River and to ensure Poland's water security."
25176	11	The tactics adopted by Kaczyński's camp - a mixture of arrogance with manipulation and information rationing - will fail anyway. Because sooner or later the answers will be known. If it turns out that it was about hiding the truth, voters, even PiS voters, will not let go of the topic.
25176	13	Hooting that asking questions is unpatriotic is a caricature of constructive parliamentary work. Members of Parliament are patriotic when they ask specific questions to those in power. It is unpatriotic to avoid them as the ecological clock ticks louder and louder.
25176	15	Part two. Golden algae
25176	17	Finally, they came up with: it's golden algae, not KGHM with the permission of Wody Polskie, or some other large state-owned company. A natural disaster, as in other European rivers. Back off, Tusk.
25176	19	"Only these salts, what about them? Where did they suddenly come from, and golden algae are fattening on them? Anyway, it's not their fault, it's the ""political chutzpah"" of the opposition. And the problem is over, because PiS writhes and whines until his PR supporters give him something. When he has a message they consider credible, the nerves calm down."
25176	21	"Early. There are the first polls already from the inside of the Odrzan turmoil. Nearly 70 percent believe that the current government is to blame. In a political poll, Tusk is separated from Kaczyński by only 2 percent, a statistical error. The downward trend for PiS continues. It is probably too late to get to the full truth about the catastrophe. ""Tardiness"" helped to cover up traces and evidence. But indignation is not so easily avoided."
2518	2	Left Convention. Almost all speeches advocated for mandatory vaccinations
2518	4	"Instead of fighting the pandemic, the rulers are fighting for power, said the leaders of the Left Włodzimierz Czarzasty and Robert Biedroń at the Saturday convention. They argued that in the name of maintaining the ""fragile majority in the Sejm"", the government listens to people who claim that if someone is vaccinated against Covid-19, they have a chip."
2518	6	"During Saturday's convention, activists of the Left and invited doctors, epidemiologists and people who lost loved ones in the pandemic, argued for the leftist vision of ""Prescriptions For Poland"", as they called a package of solutions that - in their opinion - will effectively help the state, including local governments, in fighting the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and overcoming its effects. They also presented proposals for the development of the health care system, e.g. through a jump in the salary of medical staff."
2518	8	"Almost all speeches advocated the introduction of mandatory vaccinations against Covid-19, which the co-chairman of the New Left, MEP Robert Biedroń summed up by declaring that ""mandatory vaccinations are a guarantee of safety for all of us""."
2518	10	"According to the co-chairman of the New Left Włodzimierz Czarzasty, people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 get sick less often, and if they do get sick, the course of the disease is lighter. He also referred to statistical data showing that vaccinated people are less likely to die, and 90% of currently hospitalized patients die. are unvaccinated people. ""Is there any conclusion from this?"" - He was asking. ""I have an idea - maybe people need to be vaccinated"" - he added."
2518	12	Czarzasty, and earlier other members of the Left, reminded that on December 7 last year, their group submitted a bill to the Sejm on mandatory, but not compulsory vaccinations. Czarzasty pointed out that since then in Poland, as he said, over a million people fell ill with Covid-19, and 20,000 of them died.
2518	14	"Czarzasty argued that when it comes to fighting the epidemic, the rulers do not listen to experts or doctors. ""Prime Minister, do you know why the doctors left you. Because you don't want to listen to them. And many of them advised you to have mandatory vaccinations,"" he said to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. ""You listen to madmen, people who think the world is flat, you listen to people who think that this flat world lies on the shell of a turtle. You listen to people who say that if you get vaccinated, you have a chip - Chinese, Russian, that he will behave like a robot, that he will not think that this chip will take his mind out of him - he added."
2518	16	"The deputy marshal of the Sejm accused the Prime Minister and PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński that ""in the name of the parliamentary majority, the parliamentary majority kills people."" Czarzasty also claimed that Morawiecki and Kaczyński only listen to politicians who ""have neither knowledge nor reason, but only bad emotions"" to maintain this majority. Several times in this narrative, he pointed to the member of the PiS Parliamentary Club, Anna Maria Siarkowska from the Republican Party, considered in his environment to be the leader of ""anti-vaccinationists"". ""You create such a situation that the parliamentary majority kills people,"" Czarzasty repeated."
2518	18	"In turn, MEP Biedroń assessed that Morawiecki and his cabinet decided that ""nothing can be done, that we have to wait out the pandemic"", and then referred to Saturday's congress of European right-wing and conservative parties in Spain."
2518	20	Today, Prime Minister Morawiecki, instead of fighting for the life and health of Poles, meets with pro-Putin, anti-European leaders. He is not interested in Polish women and Poles. He betrayed – emphasized Biedroń.
2518	22	"According to the MEP, ""in most European countries, security standards have been in place for a long time, which are lacking in Poland"", while the ruling camp in Poland called the ""Nie Da Się"" party."
2518	24	Covid passports? Prime Minister Morawiecki says + it is impossible +. Mandatory vaccination - +cannot+, free mass testing - +cannot+, privileges for the vaccinated and safety for all of us - +cannot+. Today, we can say with full responsibility that we are governed by the +Nie Da Się+ party. Morawiecki and Kaczyński, as can be seen today, can only spread their hands idly, as if hundreds of people dying every day, Polish women and men, meant nothing to them, Biedroń said.
2518	26	"In his opinion, the only thing the ruling camp is interested in today is maintaining a ""fragile majority in the Sejm"". ""They do it in a brutal way, using bribery, blackmail and wiretapping"" - he enumerated. ""Instead of fighting the pandemic, they are fighting for power"" - assessed the co-chairman of the New Left."
2518	28	The left wants to say clearly and clearly: we are on the side of life, we will do everything to fight for the health and safety of Polish women and men, he declared.
2518	30	"Biedroń argued that, unlike the current ruling camp, the Left was up to the task. ""We put specific things on the table, we have specific proposals regarding mandatory vaccinations, privileges for the vaccinated, Covid passports, public health care and a jump in salaries for medical staff,"" he enumerated."
2518	32	"At the same time, he appealed to ""the entire democratic opposition"" to unite ""for the health and safety of Polish women and men"" and to create a ""coalition for life""."
25181	3	From March 1, 2022, i.e. less than 2 years from the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the COVID-19 pandemic, Poles have the opportunity to be vaccinated with the new Novavax vaccine. What makes it stand out? How does it work and what are its side effects?
25181	5	COVID-19 vaccinations are widely available from December 2020. Since then, almost 60% of the Polish population has been vaccinated. A fifth vaccine called Nuvaxovid by Novavax has been available since March this year. The Minister of Health announced that people who are 18 years old can be vaccinated with it.
25181	7	Novavax vaccine - composition, action, history of creation
25181	9	So far, you can get vaccinated against coronavirus with several types of vaccines, which can be divided into 3 groups:
25181	11	- vector - Astra Zeneca, Johnson&Johnson/Janssen,
25181	13	- traditional, i.e. protein - Novavax,
25181	15	- mRNA - Moderna, Pfizer BioNTech.
25181	17	The latest of them, Nuvaxovid, is a product of the American biotechnology company Novavax. Interestingly, a few years ago, the company was in danger of being removed from the stock exchange. This was due to the fact that despite spending millions on research, none of the Novavax products met with a favorable opinion of regulatory authorities. The fate of the company was saved only by the COVID-19 vaccine.
25181	19	Nuvaxovid is one of the traditional protein vaccines. It contains an antigen in the form of purified protein S (spike) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as an adjuvant of plant origin obtained from the soapwood. Its effectiveness and safety have been proven thanks to clinical trials conducted on 60,000 participants.
25181	21	How does Novavax work? After the antigen enters the body, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and starts producing antibodies as well as T lymphocytes. Thanks to this, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus starts to infect the body, the immune system will be prepared for this attack. It will recognize a foreign protein and trigger a cascade of defense processes.
25181	23	The Novavax vaccine is given in two doses, not less than 3 weeks apart.
25181	25	Contraindications to taking Novavax
25181	27	Contraindications to the COVID-19 vaccination with Nuvaxovid include an anaphylactic reaction to any of its components. The vaccine can be given to people who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
25181	29	Novavax vaccine side effects
25181	31	The side effects of the Novavax vaccine are not much different from the complications of other vaccines. Most often it is noted:
25181	33	- tenderness/pain at the injection site,
25181	35	- muscle pain,
25181	37	- Headache,
25181	39	- general weakness of the body,
25181	41	- nausea and vomiting
25181	43	- arthralgia.
25181	45	Most vaccine adverse reactions (ADRs) are mild and resolve spontaneously.
25186	1	"North Korea: Kim Jong Un declared the victory of the ""socialist regime"" over the coronavirus"
25186	3	"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared a ""victory"" in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and ordered the lifting of the strictest containment measures introduced in May, the official KCNA news agency reported on Thursday."
25186	5	"According to KCNA, Kim stated that the official number of deaths from the epidemic of 74 people ""is an unprecedented miracle"" compared to other countries."
25186	7	"The North Korean leader ordered the lifting of the strictest measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic, but said that North Korea must maintain a ""steel-like anti-epidemic barrier and intensify work to combat the epidemic until the global health crisis is over."""
25186	9	Reuters reminds that North Korea has never reported the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19. From July 29, however, it reported that no new cases had been detected, which, according to independent experts, was the result of limited testing capacity.
25186	11	"Nothing is known about the vaccination campaign in this country. Authorities reported that the fight against the virus consisted of lockdowns, home remedies and what Kim said was ""the advantage of the Korean socialist system."""
25186	13	As KCNA wrote, Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, revealed that the brother had a high fever. It also accused South Korea of ​​contributing to the outbreak.
25192	1	Will (when?) we will grow watermelons in Poland?
25192	3	"In the past, the cultivation of apricots or vines in Poland was marginal and difficult. Weather conditions allow it today. With climate change, will we cultivate species that are currently ""reserved"" for the countries of southern Europe?"
25192	5	Several decades ago, apricot cultivation in Poland on a commercial scale did not exist. The establishment of numerous apricot orchards in the Sandomierz basin was made possible by: climate change and the breeding of varieties suitable for Polish soil and climatic conditions. A few years ago, the climate in Sandomierz was like in Hungary in the 1970s.
25192	7	However, the climate is changing all the time. We can also see it on the basis of the development of viticulture in Poland, which did not develop so dynamically in the last century. The question remains when the climatic conditions in Poland will allow the cultivation of watermelons, kiwis or other species produced today in southern Europe?
25192	9	"We will also meet more ""dark"" visions of climatologists. Some computer simulations show that the south of Europe in a few hundred years will not be suitable for agricultural production at all, and this will slowly move to the north of the continent."
25192	11	The best example for the above theses is southern Italy. In Calabria, Basilicata, Puglia and Sicily, there is talk of a tropicalized climate. In the south of the country, there is a growing interest in the cultivation of mangoes, avocados, papayas and goji berries. Why? Because the growing climate of southern Italy allows for the cultivation of these species.
25192	13	In Puglia (i.e. the so-called Italian heel), exotic crops already amount to 500 hectares. Demand for exotic fruits is also growing in the country. In view of the above, a further increase in plantings in this segment is expected. Climate warming is often considered a conspiracy theory. One thing is certain, the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change. Along with it, conditions for agricultural and horticultural production also in Poland.
25194	1	Hypocrisy. Macron in the heat of criticism after revealing holiday photos
25194	3	The French president has been labeled an eco-hypocrite by environmentalists. Emmanuel Macron was caught riding a jet ski weeks after urging his compatriots to save energy.
25194	5	"Last month, Macron made an urgent appeal to the French nation for the public to engage in an ""effort of solidarity"" aimed at protecting the environment and rational use of energy. The French president also instructed ministers to develop ""energy-saving"" plans to reduce energy consumption by 10%. in the next two years."
25194	7	“We must prepare for a scenario in which we will have to do without Russian gas completely. It is very likely. We need a general mobilization, said Macron during the celebrations of the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution.
25194	9	Eco-hypocrisy
25194	11	Macron is known for his love of water sports, especially jet skiing. Every summer since 2017, the French president has been photographed riding these vehicles.
25194	13	Photos published this week show Macron enjoying himself on these vehicles at the Riviera Fort de Brégançon estate, the official residence of French presidents since 1968. This time, however, his riding on jet skis, which consume huge amounts of fuel (four to ten times more than the average passenger car), sparked outrage among members of the National Assembly.
25194	15	"Green MP Sandrine Rousseau said: ""This confirms the persistent impression that [Macron - ed. red.] does not understand climate change. And nowadays it's a crime not to understand that."""
25194	17	"One MP from Macron's party from La République En Marche told the tabloid Voici he was ""incredulous"" when he saw pictures of the president on a scooter."
25194	19	Macron's failure
25194	21	However, playing on gas-guzzling jet skis is not the only offense that environmentalists accuse the French president of. Recently, Macron tweeted several entries about the fires raging in France, which many activists have linked to climate change.
25194	23	"Interestingly, Macron himself said last month that the recent increase in forest fires in Mediterranean countries is ""a consequence of climate change."""
25194	25	According to activists, the French president showed hypocrisy by pointing to the effects of global warming, while himself giving himself up to a game that consumes huge amounts of fuel.
25195	1	They want to remove Tusk?
25195	3	"The PO leadership is starting to develop an idea to remove Donald Tusk from the leadership of the party, and the leaders of the future coalition, Rafał Trzaskowski, Szymon Hołownia and Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, would take his place during the election campaign. As the former head of PO Grzegorz Schetyna says: ""The idea is interesting because it integrates opposition circles (...). It would have to be built by an understanding or coming to an agreement opposition."""
25195	5	The disclosure of such plans shows that Tusk's position is weakening, as public discussion of such a scenario not so long ago would have met with serious consequences, including expulsion from the party. One thing is certain, Tusk's return did not cause an increase in ratings, on the contrary - a slight decrease. A Social Changes survey from a few days ago shows that KO could count on 25.4 percent. support, and the United Right at 39 percent. Such a result does not satisfy Tusk's supporters, on the contrary - it causes an increase in dissatisfaction. But no wonder, his embarrassing statements discredit him and the party he represents. This is slowly reaching the supporters of the opposition, maybe that's why Schetyna revealed the plans that are being talked about in the opposition environment.
2527	1	Korwin-Mikke: Imposing sanctions on Russia is completely absurd
2527	3	Russia can do without gold sooner than we can do without gas. Indeed, imposing sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity, says Janusz Korwin-Mikke, MP of the Confederation and president of the KORWiN party, in an interview with the DoRzeczy.pl portal.
2527	5	DoRzeczy.pl: Russia turned off Poland's gas tap because our country did not agree to make payments for the raw material in rubles. The president criticized the decision of the Polish government. Why?
2527	7	Janusz Korwin-Mikke: First of all, I criticize the actions of Russia, which once turns off and then turns on the gas tap. On the Russian side, we have a situation of decision fever, which can be seen by the whole war, how it is conducted. There is clearly something wrong with Russia, but that doesn't change the fact that our government made a fool of itself by giving up Russian gas and oil. In that case, since they turned off the tap, we should be happy.
2527	9	The government says we are prepared for this. We just need to be ready for a price increase.
2527	11	I have always explained that sanctions work both ways. On the one hand, of course, the Russians stop receiving money, but on the other hand, we stop receiving gas. Russia can do without gold sooner than we can do without gas. Indeed, imposing sanctions on Russia is completely absurd.
2527	13	Why?
2527	15	We say we don't want to have anything to do with Russia, we don't get gas and we wonder what now. Western countries impose numerous sanctions on Russia, but they want gas. Isn't that absurd?
2527	17	In that case, how to punish Russia for the situation in Ukraine?
2527	19	Wait a minute, but why punish? Can we punish other countries for their actions at all? After all, we are not some international tribunal that will punish Russia, or Ukraine, or maybe China. For example, we can be offended by the United States for their actions. This is not done and the economy is not mixed with politics.
2527	21	But there is war, we are dealing with genocide.
2527	23	Let's be clear. I claim that H.E. Vladimir Putin committed a war crime because, according to the Hague Convention, it is forbidden to attack another country without declaring war on it. However, waging war itself is not a crime. It is a normal means of conflict resolution. The entire history of Europe is full of wars. We do not call Alexander of Macedon a war criminal, although more people died during his wars than during the Russo-Ukrainian war. We do not call Napoleon, Stefan Batory or other leaders criminals.
2527	25	You mentioned that the war is being conducted strangely. So how?
2527	27	Russia started by shelling Kiev and Kharkov, which is complete nonsense. Additionally, it is not allowed to shoot at civilians. States fight against each other, not civilians. The fact that Russia fired on and disabled the entire Ukrainian air force on the first day means that we are dealing with a war with the state. By contrast, the shooting of civilians and the bombing of cities must be strongly condemned.
2527	29	And let's not get the economy involved anyway?
2527	31	Of course. If that's what we want, let's declare war on Russia.
2527	33	war?
2527	35	Yes. After all, in Poland, the thesis is promoted that Ukraine is able to win the war with Russia. Poland is a country with a similar potential. Apparently, we also have an excellent, well-armed army. If this is true, then go ahead: let's declare war on Russia and together with Ukraine we will definitely defeat it. This is reasonable action.
2527	37	In your opinion, will the economic costs of war for the whole world deepen?
2527	39	I do not understand. After all, if two countries are at war, everyone else is making money. They supply arms to both sides, equipment, etc. Neighboring countries never lose.
2527	41	But citizens lose the economy due to high inflation.
2527	43	Thanks to these idiotic sanctions, the Americans support India and China, which get gas and oil cheaper, because they are sold to them by the Russians at a promotional price. That is why I believe that we should also buy gas from Russia. Let's not mix economy with war, just like let's not mix politics and sport. I grew up in communist times. When our athletes did not go to the Olympics in Los Angeles for political reasons, then everyone protested. Today, however, sports are mixed with politics…
2527	45	How do you think the war in Ukraine will end?
2527	47	I have no idea. My first reaction on February 24 was that H.E. Vladimir Putin was crazy. Therefore, it is impossible to predict what will happen next.
2527	49	"While authorizing the conversation, Janusz Korwin-Mikke sent a Post Scriptum: ""Min. The UK Foreign Office has just admitted that the Kingdom has long been arming Ukraine and training its soldiers. So are the US and Canada. In that case, I change my mind about this ""madness"": Russia should have issued an ultimatum to Ukraine already ±5 years ago."
2528	1	Russia can avoid bankruptcy. The Western sanctions machine is clearly stuck
2528	3	It is uncertain whether the current sanctions will be enough to overthrow Vladimir Putin. But it will be very difficult for Joe Biden to convince the EU to the new ones.
2528	5	On the eve of the second month of the war in Ukraine, the western machinery of imposing sanctions on Russia clearly stalled. After four rounds of restrictions coordinated by the US, the EU and the UK, no new initiatives are in sight. Even though Joe Biden's attendance at the EU-NATO summit in Brussels this Thursday would be a great opportunity to announce them.
2528	7	The American president made it clear from the beginning: the United States will not take a direct part in the Ukrainian war. That is why, apart from supplying Ukrainians with weapons, unprecedented sanctions have always been the main US tool to defeat the Kremlin. The idea was to raise the price of the invasion so high for Vladimir Putin's entourage and the wider Russian society that they would decide to overthrow the dictator or at least make him stop fighting.
2528	9	Fall, but no drama
2528	11	Did it work? Diplomatic sources advise patience. In their opinion, only in April will the restrictions imposed by the West be fully felt by the Russians.
2528	13	Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs announced its impact assessment of Biden's strategy. Her image is mixed. The bank expects the country's national income to collapse by 10% this year. This is as much as during the crisis in 1998, which forced Boris Yeltsin to leave and opened the way to power for Putin. Even in the midst of the 2009 financial crisis, the recession (7.8%) was shallower.
2528	15	However, in those cases, it was a purely economic collapse without a conflict that could unite the Russian people around power. Whether the Russian public will actually be ready to make sacrifices in the name of rebuilding the empire remains unknown. For now, 58 percent of those surveyed support the war, and 23 percent is against it. However, the Kremlin's propaganda machine plays a huge role in this, as it prevents the Russians from learning the truth, e.g. regarding the number of victims among Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. This, however, will come to light sooner or later, as will the economic costs of the invasion.
2528	17	The latter, however, may be smaller than expected. Goldman Sachs admits that Russia is unlikely to avoid disorderly bankruptcy. And this is because it benefits from the increase in the prices of raw materials, especially energy carriers, caused by the war. Therefore, according to the bank, even this year Moscow will maintain a current account surplus, which will allow it to loosen currency restrictions (ban on exporting more than USD 5,000). The central bank will probably also manage to maintain some control over the ruble exchange rate. Goldman Sachs expects 20 percent inflation. That's a lot, but not enough to make the prices out of control.
2528	19	On Monday, Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to the West to do more. He encouraged the EU to follow in the footsteps of the US and Great Britain, which introduced an embargo on imports of Russian oil. More: The Ukrainian president pushed for stopping all trade with Russia and closing European ports to its ships.
2528	22	Chemical weapon
2528	24	However, it is doubtful that this will happen, at least for now. Poland, the Baltic states, Denmark and Ireland belong to a small group of EU countries that are in favor of stopping imports of Russian oil, but Germany is strongly against it. Berlin's objection is seen as a good excuse to reduce the cost of sanctions by a number of other EU countries, such as Italy and France. As for the complete suspension of trade with Russia, Mateusz Morawiecki failed to convince even the key partner from the region: the Czech Republic.
2528	26	Germany fears that further, forcible tightening of sanctions will push the West into a deep economic crisis, including due to the sharp rise in energy prices. The US caution comes from something else. Before leaving for Europe, President Biden warned allies that Putin was increasingly likely to use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine. This would be evidenced by the Kremlin's allegations that it is the Ukrainians who run the chemical weapons program with the support of the Americans: a good excuse to use this forbidden weapon yourself.
2528	28	The White House therefore fears that Putin, increasingly desperate for the situation at the front, will decide to make uncontrollable moves. In this context, perhaps the imposition of sanctions on Russia should also be gradual, diplomats wonder.
2528	30	"A signal of growing frustration in Moscow is also the summons to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the American ambassador John Sullivan. He has been told that Russia's diplomatic ties with the US are ""on the verge of breaking"" after Biden called Putin a ""war criminal"" last week."
2528	32	"""A country that is appalled by such a term while continuing to commit mass slaughter of civilians cannot be taken seriously,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said. The US established diplomatic relations with the USSR in 1933 and never broke them."
2530	1	Embargo on gas and oil from Russia? Le Pen's unequivocal position
2530	3	Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron's rival in the race for French president, has declared that she strongly supports all sanctions against Russia, except those regarding the oil and gas embargo.
2530	5	"In a recent interview with France Inter Radio Le Pen, who will challenge the incumbent president for the country's highest office in two weeks' time in the second round of elections, said she did not want ""the French to suffer the consequences of the embargo"" on Russian oil and gas."
2530	7	France, like many other European countries, imports most of its natural gas via pipelines from Russia, using it to produce energy for residential and commercial purposes.
2530	9	"I am absolutely in favor of all other sanctions,"" Le Pen declared. The candidate of the National Union was criticized for her words. In turn, during the election campaign, her political opponents pointed out her too close relations with Russia during the war in Ukraine."
2530	11	Allegations of pro-Russianism
2530	13	Previously, the ZN leader seemed to support Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula, and in 2017 she called for the lifting of international sanctions on this issue.
2530	15	In 2014, when Crimea was annexed by Russia, her political party received a loan from a Russian bank.
2530	17	"Marine Le Pen justified her position on the annexation of Crimea by saying that Russia's actions at the time were a ""different situation"" from the current invasion of Ukraine, and presented her support for Putin as reflecting her wider ambitions for a ""multipolar"" world."
2530	19	Despite softening his stance on leaving the European Union and other nationalist issues in recent years, he still faces widespread opposition from much of the French political establishment.
2530	21	Former President Nicolas Sarkozy publicly announced on Tuesday that he would vote for his party's rival Emmanuel Macron and encouraged others to do so.
2537	1	"""Live and let others live."" Why do attempts to reduce meat consumption evoke such emotions?"
2537	3	Over 8 percent of Poles is on a vegan or vegetarian diet. Meanwhile, Polish Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda advertises meat, and MEP Sylwia Spurek wants to promote veganism. What next for meat on our plates?
2537	5	Voices in the discussion on reducing meat consumption refer to various issues - from concerns about the future of farmers and restrictions on free choice to climate aspects or animal welfare.
2537	7	The European Union, on the other hand, wants to achieve climate goals, e.g. by reducing the consumption of red meat among the inhabitants of the Community, but does not cease to promote it.
2537	9	Schools without meat
2537	11	"Gregory Doucet, the mayor of Lyon's Green party, decided last week that the canteens in the city's schools would not include meat meals. Gerald Darmanin, France's interior minister, called the decision an ""unacceptable insult"" to French farmers, while Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie asked ""not to put ideology on children's plates."""
2537	13	However, as the mayor said, the most important argument was not to impose a vegan diet on students, but to improve the service during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, his predecessor from the right-wing party was to apply the same solutions at the beginning of the crisis.
2537	15	Although in Lyon the time restrictions have led to outrage from some groups - including protests by farmers - there are schools where students have not eaten meat products for many years. In 2015, the private MUSE school in California became the first educational institution in the United States where the canteen menu consisted of meals based only on products of plant origin.
2537	17	Initially, the parents of almost half of the students transferred their children to other schools, fearing for their health. In an interview with the Guardian, the headmaster said at the time that such decisions should always be confronted with a confrontation based, as he said, not on facts but on disinformation.
2537	19	"School vegetarianism, however, is not new. Already at the beginning of the 20th century, the St Christopher school was established in Great Britain. One of the principles on which the founders based its functioning was respect for ""all races and religions"" and vegetarianism."
2537	21	"Tolerance for all faiths - but also for people with different health conditions regarding diet - was one of the three arguments of the headmistress of the British Swan School, where students have access only to vegetarian dishes. Kay Wood also cited the ability to provide ""better quality meals for the same money"" and greater environmental benefits as positives."
2537	23	Similar proposals were presented two years ago by the councilors of the Warsaw district of Ochota - Sylwia Mróz, Agata Solecka and Anita Szymańska, and Councilor Marek Szolc also appealed to the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski. A common element of the initiatives was the introduction of a day of vegetarian meals in schools in the capital, so that, above all, vegans and vegetarians would not feel discriminated against.
2537	25	The authorities of both the district and the city replied that such decisions belonged to parents, and in some Warsaw institutions, students can choose between meat and meat-free dishes.
2537	27	At the same time, in 2019, Warsaw was ranked 6th in the ranking of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world - next to e.g. London, New York and Berlin. This classification was prepared by the HappyCow portal, which creates guides to places open to vegan cuisine. As written, the Polish capital has a wide range of easily accessible restaurants offering vegan menus.
2537	29	Commands, prohibitions or incentives?
2537	31	"The dispute over who should decide on eating habits also concerns the proposal of MEP Sylwia Spurek. A member of the European Parliament presented a plan entitled ""Five for the plant industry"", which assumes, among others, introducing a ban on advertising meat, milk and eggs, establishing a fund for the promotion of veganism, and supplementing education programs - starting from kindergarten - with classes on the climate and animal rights."
2537	33	"As Sylwia Spurek said in an interview with EURACTIV.pl, her idea ""is only the beginning of the debate about the changes that the modern agricultural industry must undergo. These will be big changes, because they affect millions of citizens of the European Union.” “I believe that the role of politicians at such a special moment is to push the boundaries of the debate and introduce important topics to it,” our interlocutor added."
2537	35	The public debate on this initiative focuses on two main strands. The first one is represented by people who believe that the consumption of animal products is healthy, and that bans in this area are too much interference in the lifestyle of citizens and may additionally have a devastating impact on Polish farmers.
2537	37	On the other side are supporters of excluding meat from diets - they consider the proposals and arguments of the MEP to be obvious and natural. They also predict that over time, more and more Poles will be convinced to abandon animal products.
2537	39	"Extreme emotions are often a factor in any discussion about meat consumption and veganism. Sociologist Jana Rückert-John, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, attempted to explain the intense reactions to the proposals for a systemic reduction in meat consumption and noted that ""nutrition is seen as one of the last bastions of privacy that no one has the right to interfere with."" And meat is an important element of this sphere, because it is also an indicator of prosperity."
2537	41	A similar trend in the society's attitude to changing habits is also noticed by Sylwia Spurek. “Controversies have arisen over the legal obligation to wear seat belts in the car, the ban on smoking in public places and even the ban on corporal punishment of children. But as history has shown, the introduction of these bans into legal systems also had an educational dimension, changed the way of thinking about safety, health and human rights, stressed the MEP.
2537	43	According to the 2019 ZielonyJemy report, interest in plant-based cuisine is actually growing in Poland. In the analyzed period, 8.4 percent. Poles were on a vegan or vegetarian diet, and 3.8 percent. decided to limit meat dishes to fish. Young people aged 18 to 24 are the most likely to give up meat, according to the analysis.
2537	45	"Fast food chains are also increasingly convinced of the plant-based menu. McDonald's has signed an agreement with the American company Beyond Meat, which develops vegan meat substitutes. The first result of the cooperation this year is to be a burger called McPlant. For two years, British KFC customers have been able to buy the ""The Imposter"" burger. The product resembles a traditional burger, but its cutlet is made of quorn - a mushroom meat substitute. In Poland, we will not experience such a thing, but we will find a vegetarian sandwich in the fast food menu - with halloumi cheese. We can also buy vegan burgers in most chain grocery stores - from Biedronka, through Lidl, to Żabka."
2537	47	Ideology or strategy supported by facts?
2537	49	"There is a common belief that - as the Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda wrote on Twitter - ""meat, milk, dairy products are full of valuable nutrients."" Sylwia Spurek, on the other hand, points out that ""we have extensive knowledge about the correlation between milk and dairy consumption and Parkinson's disease, prostate cancer and breast cancer."""
2537	51	"The Lancet's EAT committee, which considers diets in terms of both ecology and health, explains that ""a healthy diet ... consists mostly of a variety of plant-based foods and a small amount of animal-based foods."""
2537	53	In order to adjust people's habits to the optimal – according to Lancet specialists – diet on a global scale, the consumption of plant products should be increased by half and the consumption of animal products reduced by half (this includes, apart from meat, also dairy products and eggs).
2537	55	If there was a widespread change in eating habits - according to the presented estimates - up to 11 million people a year would have a chance to live longer. Although some researchers disagree that removing meat - especially red meat - from the diet has a significant impact on improving health. In 2015, the World Health Organization recognized that excessive consumption of meat products can cause cancer.
2537	57	At the beginning of 2020, the European branch of Greenpeace announced that in order to reduce the contribution of agriculture to the negative climate effects, meat consumption in the European Union must fall by 71%. by 2030 and by 81 percent. by 2050 (referring to 2017 FAO data presented below).
2537	59	"As the creators of the Climate Science portal explain, the so-called climate change has the greatest impact on climate change. the long shadow of farming, which includes ""greenhouse gas emissions from the digestive systems of cattle"", but also - making up the majority - those related to the implementation of the supply chain or deforestation of land to produce animal feed."
2537	61	European Union for health, climate and meat producers
2537	63	"In recent years, European institutions have often financed meat promotion campaigns. In 2015, the project ""Tasty, it's from Europe"" was launched. Its aim was to increase the attractiveness of European agricultural products in the EU and third countries. Under this program, funding for their promotion was to increase ""from €61 million in 2013 to €200 million in 2019."" A large part of the funds went to the meat industry."
2537	65	"For example, in 2016, the Pork lovers Europe project was approved to promote pork. Its authors pointed out that the consumption of this type of meat in the EU decreased in the period from 2008 to 2015 by 0.8 kg per capita (from 41.7 kg to 40.9 kg, respectively). They also emphasized that ""it is important to promote pork and restore confidence to consumers"", which could be undermined, for example, by the WHO report on the carcinogenicity of meat."
2537	67	"In 2019, the Proud of EU Beef campaign was launched, under which advertising spots were prepared, encouraging the consumption of beef under the slogan ""become a beefatarian"". The strategy's creators explained that there was a need to improve the perception of red meat, as consumers are abandoning its purchase due to ""various types of information presented recently""."
2537	69	"According to critics, the promotion of meat contradicts the EU's climate and health goals - i.e. the ""Farm to Fork"" strategy and the ""European plan to fight cancer"", which reaffirm the importance of including less animal products in the diet."
2537	71	Sylwia Spurek points out that EU institutions not only promote products of animal origin, but also do not support the plant industry. “The largest plant startups are created overseas, not in Europe. If the European Union has ambitions to be the leader of the green transformation, it cannot continue to focus on meat and milk. It must focus on the development of the plant industry”, which is why, according to the MEP, “funds are needed to support research and development of such an industry”.
2537	73	“It is clear to me that with the necessary reduction in demand for meat and milk, we must ensure access to alternatives to these products. Step by step, products that are harmful must disappear from the shelves, and in their place - products that are climate-friendly, created with the preservation of biodiversity and ethical. Unfortunately, in this matter, the European Commission seems to be paralyzed by the fear of the opinion of the big lobby,” summed up the European Parliament member.
2537	75	How much meat do we eat?
2537	77	According to an analysis of the Our World In Data website, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2017, Spaniards consumed the most meat in the EU – 100.25 kg per person per year.
2537	79	Portugal (94.06 kg) came second, followed by Poland (88.7 kg) and Germany (87.78 kg). At the end of the EU list were Bulgarians (58.31 kg) and Slovaks (59.34 kg).
2537	81	For comparison, the largest amount of meat consumed on a global scale is over 120 kg (this group includes, for example, Hong Kong, the United States, Australia), and the lowest results - e.g. in India, Bangladesh or Ethiopia - do not exceed 5 kg.
2537	83	According to the authors of the analysis, meat consumption is highest in high-income countries, and the average global meat consumption has increased by about 20 kg since 1961. However, meat production declined two years ago, and the trend continued into the pandemic year.
2537	85	One of the clearest examples of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on meat consumption is Argentina, famous for its beef steaks, where in 2020 you had to pay up to four times more for meat products than three years earlier.
2537	87	The minimum wage of Argentines also fell, and therefore they could buy fewer such products. In this way, one of the lowest levels of meat consumption in the history of the South American country was reached.
2537	89	"This is a paradox, because Argentina - as ""El País"" writes - is one of the world's largest producers of beef. Last year, the country exported a record amount of beef in history - 900,000. tons worth 2.7 billion. hole. That's 6.5 percent. more than in 2019, according to data from the Chamber of Meat Industry and Trade (CICCRA). Most go to China."
2546	1	The war covers the plans of evil globalists? It's a conspiracy theory!
2546	3	FAKE NEWS IN A NUTSHELL
2546	5	A short video appeared on Facebook in which it was argued that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is intended to distract people from the conspiracies of the world's elites who, through a pandemic treaty, are trying to take over the world and take away civil liberties.
2546	7	The pandemic treaty is not an intricate and nefarious plan by unspecified global elites, and the intentions to create it have been known since 2020. Its goal is to develop mechanisms that will prevent and counteract future pandemics.
2546	9	"From one of the videos distributed on Facebook, we will learn that the currently ongoing war in Eastern Europe is a planned action of unspecified global elites. Its aim is to divert the attention of the whole world from the solutions introduced under the guise of warfare to enslave humanity. The war in Ukraine is a real problem. People die in armed attacks. The recording, however, argued that ""this is not a war between Russia and Ukraine, or the US against China. Only on the line of degenerate self-proclaimed global elites versus the entire world population"" (recording time 03:05). Such a conclusion was drawn on the basis of several false information that was circulated on the web. It is not backed up by facts."
2546	11	Treaty on Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness. Will the WHO take over the world?
2546	13	"On the recording presenting the conspiracy theory, we hear that: ""The first meeting of the intergovernmental negotiating body is to take place in Geneva on the signing of an international pandemic prevention and preparedness treaty, which will permanently deprive 194 member countries of any decision-making and financial sovereignty in the area of ​​health policy for the WHO (recording time 00:45). What really is an international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness? From December 1, 2021, work is underway to develop a ""convention, agreement or other international instrument that would be a legally binding act of international law."""
2546	15	However, the idea itself dates back to 2020, when no one knew what could happen after two years, as we wrote about in one of our recent analyses.
2546	17	"As we can read on the European Commission's website: ""The instrument would define the objectives and basic principles that would allow us to organize a common, necessary fight against pandemics."" So it's not an idea to be afraid of."
2546	19	The scientists support the plan to create joint recommendations
2546	21	According to the scientific community, the development of such solutions is needed in the face of advancing globalization and the associated pandemic threats. The world of science is aware that there will also be more pandemics in the future. The development of the treaty would enable the implementation of a number of benefits that could be transformed into effective prevention and combating threats.
2546	23	Information about the removal of sovereignty and civil rights is false
2546	25	"The film further stated that: ""If the treaty is signed (...) from now on, all decisions and regulations of the WHO will be considered superior and binding on the member states, which will open the door to the introduction of total digital control over the global population under the pretext of protecting health ( ...)"" (recording time 01:15). This would allegedly lead to global censorship and control of societies. However, there are no indications that the introduction of the treaty would take away the sovereignty of states in the field of health policy. The introduction of the treaty would enable cooperation against future pandemics, as pointed out by representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO)."
2546	27	“The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on many shortcomings in the global system to protect people from the pandemic: the most vulnerable people who do not have vaccines, healthcare workers without the necessary equipment to do life-saving work, and the “me first” approach that inhibits the global solidarity needed to dealing with a global threat. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General
2546	29	Contrary to conspiracy theories, these are not solutions that would enslave people or act to the detriment of the global population. On the contrary, thanks to this - in accordance with the will of the initiators - it would be possible to coordinate cooperation in the international arena in a more effective way, while maintaining the principles of solidarity, justice, inclusiveness and transparency.
2546	31	However, at the moment it is not possible to assess what shape the final version of the treaty will take, as it has not yet been drawn up. Suggestions regarding the loss of state sovereignty to WHO have no justification or support in the existing arrangements, remaining contrary to the basic assumptions of the initiators.
2546	33	Taking away freedom through the obligation to vaccinate - how much truth is there?
2546	35	"The premises that were treated as evidence of the existence of a conspiracy was the belief that mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 would soon be introduced in Poland. As we hear on the recording: ""In Poland, a draft law on compulsory vaccination and Covid passports has just been submitted to the Sejm"" (recording time 00:15). The groups covered by mandatory vaccinations against COVID-19 included medical professionals, pharmacists, medical students and employees of medical entities."
2546	37	The idea of ​​introducing mandatory vaccinations for all Poles has been considered for a long time, but so far no such solutions have been developed, and the parliamentary work on them has not been completed. Therefore, it is not known what the final version of the law will look like.
2546	39	Foreign troops in Poland will take away our sovereignty?
2546	41	"Further, the recipients are convinced that Poland consciously surrenders its sovereignty to a global conspiracy. As we hear: ""A few days ago, the president signed a document giving foreign troops the green light to use firearms and other means of direct coercion against Poles"" (recording time 00:20)."
2546	43	In turn, the allied troops in Poland - as some disinformation messages said - did not receive police powers, which you can read more about in one of the analyzes we published.
2546	45	Due to the tense situation in Eastern Europe, selected units stationed in Poland may use weapons or direct coercion measures only in strictly defined situations that are related to the risk of health, life or property.
2546	47	Summary
2546	49	"Conspiracy theories are based on the assumption that powerful hidden forces are behind harmful and tragic events (not necessarily ""global elites""). These, however, are characterized by the fact that they are not based on any reliable evidence and very - even sloppy - generalize reality. They are based on the belief that there is a hidden truth that only a few have access to, and they simplify the complexity of serious events in a zero-one way, presenting reality as if it were a battlefield between good and evil."
2549	1	"PiS has plans for Ukraine. It is even about the creation of a ""union"" of the two countries"
2549	3	Currently, more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border with Poland. According to research from the end of March, every fourth Ukrainian refugee plans to stay in Poland even after the war is over. However, to this should be added the 2.5 million Ukrainian immigrants who were in Poland before February 24, as well as millions more who will undoubtedly come to Poland due to the difficult economic situation in Ukraine.
2549	5	PiS has taken steps to show everyone how necessary it is to help Ukrainians coming to Poland. On the occasion of the crisis on the border with Belarus, a different position was taken. Why? Because the Polish authorities simply did not realize how to use the newcomers from the Middle East and Africa. Now PiS knows how it should settle this matter in its own interest.
2549	7	First, in the short term, the government adopted a special act enabling Ukrainians to access the labor market, health care and education systems. In addition, they received access to the PESEL system, places in schools and kindergartens. Even Polish citizens have never had such privileges. Monthly expenses for the maintenance of Ukrainian refugees range from PLN 2 to 3 billion. However, the Polish government justifies throwing money away with the possibility of staying in power for years to come.
2549	9	"Moreover, in recent weeks Warsaw has announced the adoption of far-reaching declarations on cooperation. There was even information about the creation of a ""union"" of the two countries. Under these circumstances, the question arises why PiS decided to take such actions."
2549	11	The most obvious answer is that because it is the need of the moment, because the raison d'état requires it. However, it is more likely that PiS hopes that helping Ukrainians will gain public support. Currently, PiS sees millions of its faithful voters in the Ukrainians, who will repay them for their help at the polls.
2549	13	PiS's political fantasy about the use of Ukrainians in the Polish political system looks very interesting. Firstly, it is planned to give Ukrainians the right to vote in national elections (parliamentary in 2023, presidential in 2025), which requires Polish citizenship. They can be obtained by recognition, which requires meeting certain conditions - in particular, several years of residence in Poland and knowledge of the language, or by granting it by the president. However, the President is not limited by any conditions and may grant Polish citizenship to any foreigner. Such a solution will gain PiS the potential gratitude of new Polish-Ukrainian citizens.
2549	15	In the case of local government elections, the situation is simpler. In the European Union, citizens residing in the Member State of which they are nationals have the right to vote in municipal elections in that country. In addition, some countries - e.g. Scandinavian - have granted the right to vote in local elections, under certain conditions, also to citizens of non-EU countries living there. Poland may grant such a right to refugees from Ukraine in the coming months. This only requires a change in the local government electoral law.
2549	17	Warsaw hands over weapons and urges Kyiv to take aggressive steps. However, the most important thing that the Polish government wants is the partition of Ukraine. As a result, Warsaw will gain both land and new grateful voters. And only then will PiS be able to justify multi-billion spending and maintain power. However, if something goes wrong, Poland will face difficult and dangerous times.
2556	1	End of love for Ukrainians?
2556	3	"For several weeks we have been observing a clear change in the attitude of Poles towards refugees and migrants from Ukraine. The initial euphoria and outburst of altruism have now been replaced by a much more pragmatic, ""life-like"" approach to the issue. Interesting information in this area was brought by a recent survey conducted by IBRiS for the ""Rzeczpospolita"" daily."
2556	5	As many as seven out of ten respondents want refugees from Ukraine to stay in Poland, but only if they take up a job and support themselves. The second place among the conditions of stay is the education of children in a Polish school, and the third place is learning the Polish language.
2556	7	76 percent of respondents opt for setting specific conditions for Ukrainians staying in Poland. men, most of them in the 30-39 age group (as much as 83%), mainly living in large and smaller cities - 90% and 82%. As much as 97%. of the respondents are fathers of families with at least two children.
2556	9	"As ""Rzeczpospolita"" indicates, the IBRiS survey corresponds to research recently conducted by the University of Warsaw under the direction of Dr. Robert Staniszewski. They showed that the majority of Poles, although very favorable to Ukrainians, are against granting them 500+ benefits and social benefits in Poland."
2556	11	The expectations of Poles have been clearly noticed by the government, which from July 1 no longer wants to finance accommodation and meals for Ukrainian refugees and migrants. This is to lead to the independence of Ukrainians. Meanwhile, by May 23 this year, 160,000 people found legal employment. newly arrived citizens of Ukraine. That's not even 30% of the working-age population of New Wave refugees and migrants.
2556	13	So you can say that exactly what we predicted (and published in Myśl Polska) happened a few months ago. We predicted that although Poles will still be generally favorable towards Ukrainians, feelings will gradually cool down significantly. We foresaw that we would soon realize that we were the ones paying for the government's generosity. That is why we will be increasingly opposed to distributing 500+ and other social benefits to Ukrainians. The more so that the economic situation, both in terms of our home budgets and across the country, will be increasingly difficult month by month.
2556	15	It's already happening. But it's not over yet. National antagonisms will intensify as the economic crisis escalates. The more so that the long-term conflict leads to natural fatigue and burnout of empathy. Already this fall, the first serious tensions will appear.
2556	17	"It is a pity that the rulers, instead of listening to kind warnings, have preferred to focus in recent months on silencing the opposition and stigmatizing it as ""Ruthenian toes"". Together, we could have avoided many costly mistakes. Meanwhile, we will soon have to pay a heavy bill for Mr. Kaczyński and Mr. Morawiecki's misbehavior. And no spells like ""Слава Україні!"" won't change that fact."
2558	1	Dmitry Muratov sold the Nobel medal for $103.5 million
2558	3	"In the conditions of war, it is possible and necessary to remain a decent person, and not a face from the ""Putin's friends"" team. ""Putin's friends"", even those living in democratic countries, declare the ""weakness"" of this form of government and dream of a ""strong hand"" or a ""new world order"". Dmitry Muratov's deed should become an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, most of whom are undecided about the war in Ukraine."
2558	5	"The medal of the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, was sold at an auction in the United States for $ 103.5 million. This was reported on the website of the American department store ""Heritage Auctions"", which conducted the auction. The name of the buyer is unknown."
2558	7	All proceeds from the sale of the prize will be donated to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to help Ukrainian refugee minors and their families. The auction was held on the occasion of World Refugee Day, which is celebrated on June 20.
2558	9	This deed is an example to Russian and Western intellectuals, most of whom are undecided about the war in Ukraine.
2558	11	"The phenomenon of intellectual support for Russian fascism / parallel with Nazi Germany. Intellectuals see totalitarian regimes as an opportunity for a ""new order."""
2558	13	Russia relies not only on a powerful propaganda machine, but also on intellectuals in many countries of the world.
2558	15	"The reasons for this phenomenon are the generous payment of ""work"" by the conditional Gazprom, the nostalgia for emigration, the revolutionary hobby of left-wing radical persuasion (especially in Latin America), the covering of the great Russian culture, etc."
2558	17	"All this led to the fact that everything ""non-Russian"" existing in the former USSR ceased to be perceived at all. Russia is currently implementing this idea in relation to its national peripheries, as well as the countries of Central Asia, namely the former republics of the USSR."
2558	19	"This is where Russia's fundamental mistake in Ukraine and its misunderstanding of the Baltic states lie. Russian autocrats, keen on pursuing imperial ambitions, dream of Russian Empire 2.0 as the ""Russian Empire"". And that is why all attempts by countries from the former sphere of influence to join other unions/initiatives - the EU, the Three Seas Initiative, etc. - are perceived so sensitively."
2559	3	Since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian troops, in addition to all possible crimes against humanity, carry out mass deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation with violence. The exact number of deportees is not known, since most of them are carried out in the occupied territories, but it is estimated to be between 800,000 and 1.5 million people, of whom about 300,000 are children.
2559	5	Putin considers the question of the seizure of Ukraine in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The human factor is one of the most important factors and is of particular importance for Russia. By deporting Ukrainians (mainly at a young, childbearing and productive age), Putin is thus solving Russia's demographic problem, which took on catastrophic proportions in 2021-2022, and is particularly important for remote, poor regions of Russia, which are becoming desolate and in some places there is a shortage of hands to work. The President of the Russian Federation specifically signed the law on the forced resettlement of over 100,000 deported Ukrainians to Siberia and the Arctic Circle, as well as granting them Russian citizenship in an accelerated manner. Just as Stalin forcibly deported Ukrainians in the 1930s and 40s, using their labor as a locomotive to create housing and industrial infrastructure in the USSR, the Russian dictator plans to use Ukrainians as legal slaves in the most inhospitable regions.
2559	7	At the same time, Putin leaves Ukraine without human resources. According to his concept, the Ukrainians should either be eliminated or resettled (actually remain exiles of their own country) until the final resolution of the Ukrainian question. The option of moving Ukrainians to Europe is not the right solution for Russia, because Ukrainian refugees may return and become a serious problem for Russia. Russian propaganda is so effective that the deported Ukrainians may develop an alternative understanding of the existing situation about the causes and meaning of the current Russian-Ukrainian war, in the spirit of the Kremlin's political narratives. And in the event of their return to Ukraine, these people will be a reflection of the concepts that Putin needs for the Ukrainian audience.
2559	9	"In this way, the deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation solves two issues at once and takes on a dangerous character. Ukrainians are transported to the Russian Federation via the so-called ""green corridors"" for the peaceful evacuation of civilians. So, in just one day, on March 24, more than 15,000 inhabitants were deported from Mariupol to Rostov-on-Don. People are taken to filtration camps in Taganrog or Rostov for subsequent redirection to Siberia, the Far East and the Arctic Circle. Russia is in full violation of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians and is actually dictating its conditions to Ukrainians in the occupied territories. Displaced people are left without documents, in return they get a job and an apartment. Their return to Ukraine is too difficult and complicated, requiring the participation of third countries in order to provide assistance to cross the border."
2560	3	Alleged friends of Kiev in Poland suggest Armageddon.
2560	5	As Russia makes slow progress in the heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine, there is increasing talk of a stalemate and perhaps even a possible renewed Russian attack on Kyiv. This intensified the demand of Zelensky's team for increasingly advanced weapons from the US and Europe.
2560	7	However, these requests may be too small and late. Deliveries are vulnerable to a Russian attack, and weapons require training, some of which are complex and lengthy. Moreover, while Russia initially suffered heavy casualties, the current artillery offensive is costing Ukraine some of its best-trained troops. Kiev's ability to continue to fend off Moscow's attacks is uncertain.
2560	9	"So far, Washington and various European capitals have focused on accelerating arms deliveries. But Polish politician Radoslaw Sikorski, a former defense and foreign minister who now sits in the European Parliament, has proposed a radical alternative: arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons. Sikorski said: ""Since Russia has violated the Budapest Memorandum, I believe that we, as the West, would have the right to supply Ukraine with nuclear warheads."""
2560	11	"His justification is wrong. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which regulated Kyiv's relinquishment of nuclear weapons left behind after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, included a commitment by the parties to ""seek immediate action by the UN Security Council to assist Ukraine"" if the latter is attacked or threatened with nuclear weapons nuclear. It was a meaningless promise because the only alleged potential aggressor, Russia, had the veto to disable the UN. However, Kyiv signed it knowing that the deal did not provide any significant security guarantee."
2560	13	No doubt Kyiv might now regret not giving up its inherited nuclear arsenal, though it lacked operational control over the weapons. Given America's and especially Europe's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, it would be difficult for Ukraine to maintain nuclear weapons while pursuing Western integration. India paid a significant economic price for developing its arsenal before the George W. Bush administration accepted reality and New Delhi as a nuclear power.
2560	15	In any case, Ukraine's chance passed long ago. And no one suggested moving nuclear weapons to Kiev in the run-up to Russia's attack, which would likely exacerbate the crisis and precipitate Moscow's invasion. To do so today, when the war is already raging, would risk turning an already terrible conflict into a veritable catastrophe.
2560	17	During the Cold War, nuclear weapons likely helped prevent a full-scale conventional conflict between the US and the USSR. However, should a war break out between them, the possession of nuclear weapons would greatly increase the danger. The losing side would be tempted to use nuclear weapons to restore the balance. Indeed, throughout the Cold War, Washington, which possessed a smaller military, threatened to respond to the invasion of Western Europe with nuclear weapons. Now the situation between America and Russia has been reversed.
2560	19	India and Pakistan were not nuclear powers when they fought three full-scale wars. Their ability to destroy each other may have prevented a fourth conflict, although they staged a limited but long-running war in Kashmir in 1999, known as the Kargil War, after both countries tested nuclear weapons. Pakistan's provocations, such as the 2001 and 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks on India's parliament, threatened a war that could have been stopped by fear of using nuclear weapons.
2560	21	"Of course, Ukraine needs more than nuclear weapons to become a nuclear power. It would also need means of delivery - aircraft or missiles, with associated training. And, of course, such a plan could not easily be kept secret. Moscow may preemptively respond with nuclear weapons to prevent Ukraine from deploying operational forces. After Sikorski's statement, the head of the Russian Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, warned: “Sikorski is provoking a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe. He does not think about the future of either Ukraine or Poland. If his proposals are implemented, these countries will disappear, and so will Europe."""
2560	23	In any case, the idea is impracticable. Of the allies, only the US, France and the UK possess nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to find a diplomatic way out of the war. Britain's Boris Johnson would be hesitant to deepen his European pariah status by transferring nuclear weapons to Ukraine. President Joe Biden has just returned from a trip to South Korea, where he reaffirmed Washington's determination to denuclearize North Korea. Even the Polish government, competing with the Baltic states in calling for NATO involvement in Ukraine, did not support Sikorski's proposal.
2560	25	Nevertheless, the fact that a once-serious politician would have advocated turning the ongoing conflict into a nuclear confrontation shows how dangerous this conflict has become. Moscow's invasion was unjustified. However, the allied attempt to make Ukraine a winner – increasingly supported by Ukraine's supporters in the US political elite – threatens to escalate the war on Russia's part.
2560	27	President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose and has the means to avoid it, including the ability to launch full military mobilization and use weapons of mass destruction - chemical, nuclear or both. Moscow has more at stake and will therefore always be willing to pay and risk more. The US has nothing at stake to justify the risk of a nuclear annihilation of Kiev. However, some policy makers are ready to seize this opportunity. Indeed, both Senator Mitt Romney and Evelyn Farkas of the McCain Institute would do so even if Russia used nuclear weapons against someone else, which would be a wildly irresponsible position that would jeopardize America's future.
2561	3	During the Russian-Ukrainian war, all articles about Russia and Ukraine may contain propaganda content beneficial to one of the parties to the conflict. The following pro-Russia article comes from an American medium.
2561	5	After months of lies, the media is preparing the audience for Ukraine's military defeat.
2561	7	Diogenes, one of the most enlightened philosophers of the ancient world, believed that lies were the currency of politics, and these were the lies he sought to expose and depreciate. To emphasize his point, he sometimes walked the streets of Athens with a lit lantern in broad daylight. If you asked him why he was doing this, he would say that he was looking for an honest man.
2561	9	Finding an honest man in Washington today is an equally great challenge. Diogenes would need xenon headlights in both hands.
2561	11	Still, there are brief moments of brilliance in the Washington establishment. For months, profusely lying to the American public about the causes and course of the war in Ukraine, the media is now preparing American, British and other Western audiences for Ukraine's military defeat. But it's a late operation.
2561	13	The Western media have done everything in their power to give the impression that Ukraine's defense has much more power than it really does. Careful observers noticed that the same videos showing the attack on Russian tanks were shown many times. Local counter-attacks were presented as if they were maneuvers of operational importance.
2561	15	"Russian mistakes were exaggerated out of proportion to their real importance. Russian losses and the actual extent of Ukrainian losses were distorted, fabricated or simply ignored. But the conditions of the battlefield have changed a bit since then. When the Ukrainian forces stopped in static defensive positions in the urban areas and in the central Donbass, the position of the Ukrainians became hopeless. But this development was presented as a failure for the Russians, who had not achieved ""their assumed goals""."
2561	17	"Ground troops that immobilize their troops on prepared defensive lines will be scouted, targeted and destroyed from a distance. When fixed overhead intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance devices, manned or unmanned, are combined with precision guided weapons or modern artillery systems operating on the basis of accurate target data, ""position hold"" is lethal to any ground force. This is even more true in Ukraine, where it was clear from the very beginning of Russian actions that they wanted to destroy Ukrainian forces, not to occupy Ukrainian cities or territories west of the Dnieper River."
2561	19	The result was, piece by piece, the annihilation of the Ukrainian forces. Only an episodic supply of weapons from the US and allies allowed the battered Kievan legions to hold the field. The legions that are now dying with great loss as they wage war in Washington's stead.
2561	21	The war with Moscow is lost for Kiev. Ukrainian forces are deprived of everything. Trained reserves do not exist in such numbers as to affect the battle situation, and it is getting worse by the hour. No amount of military or advisory help can change this brutal reality, with one exception - the direct intervention of US and NATO ground forces.
2561	23	The problem today is not giving the territory and population of Eastern Ukraine to Moscow, which Moscow already controls. The future of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, together with Donbas, is already decided. Moscow is also likely to secure Kharkiv and Odessa, two historically Russian and Russian-speaking cities, as well as the territories adjacent to them. These operations will cause the conflict to extend into the summer. So the problem today is how to stop the fights.
2561	25	Whether the fights will end in early fall depends on two main factors. The first is on the side of the authorities in Kiev. Will Zelensky's government agree to Biden's concept of permanent conflict with Russia?
2561	27	If the Biden administration gets its way, Kyiv will continue to function as a base for creating new forces capable of threatening Moscow. In practice, this means national suicide for Kiev by opening the heart of Ukraine west of the Dnieper to the devastating attacks of long-range missiles and missile forces.
2561	29	Of course, such a development is not inevitable. Berlin, Paris, Rome, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn and yes, even Warsaw, do not have to blindly follow Washington. Europeans, like most Americans, are staring into the abyss of the all-embracing economic collapse that Biden has already brought about in his own country. But unlike the Americans, who have to deal with the consequences of Biden's misguided policies, European governments still have the option to reject Biden's plan for permanent war in Ukraine.
2561	31	The second factor concerns Washington itself. After already pumping $60 billion, or a little more than $18 billion a month, into the trembling Ukrainian state through direct or indirect transfers, the big question is what happens to Ukrainians from the rest of the country who have not fled? Where will the funds come from to rebuild Ukraine's torn society in the unfolding global economic crisis?
2561	33	With inflation causing the cost of the average American home to increase by $460 a month to buy the same goods and services over the previous year, it is quite likely that Ukraine can easily sink into the waves like the Titanic without attracting much interest from the American electorate. . Seasoned politicians know that the time span in which Americans focus their attention on non-American matters is very short, that admitting defeat in Ukraine would likely have little or no immediate consequences.
2561	35	However, the effects of repeated strategic failures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria are cumulative. In the 1980s, General Motors wanted to tell Americans what cars to buy, but American consumers had a different opinion. Therefore, GM, which dominated the American market for 77 years, lost its position to Toyota. Washington cannot impose all the consequences, nor can it escape responsibility for its wasteful spending and the ruination of American prosperity.
2561	37	Americans go to the polls in November. The electorate itself will do more than test the American electoral system. The election is also likely to make Biden remembered for his inability to compromise, for refusing to change course, much like Herbert Hoover in 1932. Democrats will remember that their predecessors in the Democratic Party successfully fought Hoover for more than half a century. Republicans can fight with Joe Biden for the next 50 years.
2561	38	A word of explanation from the translator
2561	40	"A word of explanation - The last two sentences are understandable to people interested in the internal politics of the United States. Herbert Hoover, a Republican, won the 1928 election and then lost decisively to F.D. Roosevelt in 1932. He is remembered as the president of the Great Depression who failed him, and despite the many positive aspects of his presidency, his tenure is generally perceived as a failure. In turn, ""50 years"" may mean the advantage of Democrats in the USA until Ronald Reagan, despite the fact that there were Republican presidents at that time, but, like Eisenhower, they were basically only GOP candidates, or discredited like Nixon. The author suggests that Biden's tenure will similarly be remembered as a failure, and that Republicans will find it easier to win for the next 50 years."
2564	1	Grzegorz Braun and scientists for peace in Ukraine
2564	3	As a national-radical milieu, we have our position on the war in Ukraine (see HERE), but we also present other views, because this is the mission of the Nacjonalista.pl portal since 2005. Below is a statement read out in the Sejm by MP Grzegorz Braun.
2564	5	The people and organizations gathered here call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine and for a compromise between Russia and Ukraine that will lead to a lasting peace. War is the greatest human and cultural tragedy. People die on both sides every day: they take with them their dreams and the personal potential they represent. This is a great human tragedy. War involves degeneration. During its duration, acts of cruelty and war crimes occur. War teaches us enmity and hatred. It degenerates us as people. In the name of defending life and our humanity, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine should be stopped immediately.
2564	7	The current war, in which NATO countries are involved, supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, including offensive ones, is the most dangerous armed conflict since the Second World War. It is a great threat to the economic situation of the world and to world peace. The population of many countries is now threatened with famine due to a decrease in grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the world is experiencing a sharp increase in the price of fuels produced by Russia. As a consequence, we are facing a global economic crisis with unimaginable consequences. It will be an even greater tragedy if the current war spirals out of control and turns from a local conflict into a continental war or another world war. This will mean hundreds of millions of victims, the destruction of states and the collapse of all our civilizational achievements.
2564	9	We believe that for peace and conflict resolution, it is necessary to understand its causes. The basic factor that is often the cause of wars is fear. In this case, it is Russia's fear of NATO expansion and the fear of neighboring countries of Russia's power. Therefore, in order to resolve the conflict, mutual fear must be removed, and only professional diplomacy and readiness to compromise can lead to this, and not military actions. Another reason for the current war, which is less talked about, is the introduction of changes in the language law in Ukraine, discriminating against the Russian linguistic minority. This led to the referendum in Crimea and the war in Donbass. The current war is therefore also a consequence of inappropriate internal policy. It leads to a great human tragedy and huge destruction. Matters are not resolved by war and dragging the whole world into it, but by talk and compromise. So we call for talks, compromise and peace.
2564	11	In the globalized world we live in, states are interdependent. Due to the global position of Russia and Ukraine, the consequences of the current war have a catastrophic impact on the entire world. It is not too late to resolve this conflict, which is very harmful and dangerous for all of us. We call for reason, for repentance and for peace.

2569	3	If someone was able to fight high prices, take inflation and reduce it to zero, it was my government - said Donald Tusk, the chairman of the Civic Platform party, on Saturday during the party's convention.
2569	5	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and hot and cold tap water, said Donald Tusk, the leader of the PO, at the PO convention. Meanwhile, if PiS continues to govern, bread may cost as much as PLN 30 at the end of the year, he added.
2569	7	"On Saturday, the ""Convention of the Future"" of the Civic Platform took place in the sports and entertainment hall of the Radom Sports Center. According to the organizers, there were almost 6,000 people. people. The podium from which PO politicians spoke was placed in the middle of the room, like a boxing ring. It was also a reference to the first PO convention in 2001, when the then PO leaders Donald Tusk, Andrzej Olechowski and Maciej Płażyński stood on a similar ""platform""."
2569	9	"The first to speak was the President of the Platform, Donald Tusk, who spoke for over 40 minutes. ""It is no coincidence that it is you, and not someone else, who show Poland where there is strength, where there is good will, where there is hope for change,"" Tusk said to the gathered."
2569	11	"In his speech, he referred to the one-year re-management of the Platform. He stressed that in recent months he has visited nearly 100 towns. ""On this road, I have met people who, like you, and almost all of Poland today, are very concerned with what is happening in our homeland. They are sometimes even broken by the experiences that fall on them, and at the same time hope and faith that this situation can be changed."
2569	13	"Tusk added that he had invited the hosts of some of his meetings to the convention. ""These are not people involved in political activities. They were the ones who wanted to talk to me, although, as you may know, it's not always easy,"" he noted. ""Today we live in a country where you need to have personal courage to speak publicly with the leader of the opposition,"" he said."
2569	15	"He said that thanks to the talks with farmers he understood why ""the Polish countryside today turns away from the rulers, why Polish farmers today feel cheated by the rulers"". ""Because they were deceived,"" he said. ""What does it mean to calculate and plan profitable production in a situation where artificial fertilizers have become more expensive by 700-800 percent over the course of a year, not to mention fuel"" - he added."
2569	17	"The PO leader also spoke about police officers. He stated that ""Polish policemen and Polish policemen go into service - almost all of them without exception - to defend Poles and chase bandits, not to defend the authorities against citizens."""
2569	19	"He described his meeting on Wiejska Street with the policemen who carefully looked around before turning to him. ""They say to me: Prime Minister, maybe you would finally put things in order, because we wanted to be in the police to chase bandits, and not stand for hours, days and weeks in front of the Sejm or on Nowogrodzka Street,"" Tusk said. He assessed that ""policemen are also, to a large extent, victims of this system that PiS has built in Poland - they really want to help us, not to disturb us."""
2569	21	"Tusk also drew attention to the situation of teachers. ""Today, we have older and older teachers in Polish schools - for obvious reasons. After all, this profession, which should be one of the most attractive - because we all respect and love our teachers - has probably become the most humiliating profession. the authorities in the same week when they gave themselves - ministers, president, prime minister - raises from 40 to 60 percent - at the same time told Polish teachers that they could get a 4 percent increase with an inflation of 16 percent."" he said. ""We will never forget this humiliation, this spitting in people's faces,"" declared the PO leader."
2569	23	"Giving examples of entrepreneurs running small businesses - bistro owners and a baker - he said that ""it is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy is starting to become critical""."
2569	25	"He cited forecasts according to which one third of restaurants in Poland may not survive until the end of the year. He referred to the IBRiS study, which showed that nearly 35% of families resigned from the planned leave; one-third of families had to reduce their food expenses, a similar percentage resigned from buying household appliances and audio/video devices. According to Tusk, ""it is very clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy is beginning to become critical."""
2569	27	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and hot and cold tap water, Tusk said. Meanwhile, if PiS continues to rule, then - here he referred to experts - a loaf of bread will cost PLN 10 or even PLN 30 at the end of the year.
2569	29	What happened that for seven years they turned Poland, a truly thriving country, the pride of Europe, into a country where water and bread become a problem? - He was asking.
2569	31	What are the real sources of this high PiS prices, this inflation, which in Poland is already record-breaking in Europe? Why does it have to be the most expensive with us? The reason for PiS's high prices is greed and stupidity, Tusk said.
2569	33	"He argued that one of the biggest pro-inflationary impulses is ""a legion of PiS activists who have invaded state-owned companies and are milking the state without remorse."" ""PiS will end, high prices will end"" - he said."
2569	35	"He accused NBP president Adam Glapiński of incompetence and inability to predict, recalling his statements from less than two years ago about deflation as a threat and the ""alleged threat of an explosion of inflation""."
2569	37	"He recalled that in November last year the head of the central bank announced a decline in inflation, and he said it ""almost on the same day when Prime Minister Morawiecki spent millions of zlotys on bonds that were supposed to protect his private savings against inflation."""
2569	39	"He assumed that inflation would be gigantic, but he did not tell the Poles that. Quietly, in secret from the citizens, the rulers secured themselves a lot of money - said the PO chairman. ""Thieves!"" the crowd chanted."
2569	41	"The leader of the Civic Platform also announced that if PO wins the elections, he will ""take Glapiński out of the NBP"". ""Adam Glapiński is not only incompetent, not only indecent in what he does. Adam Glapiński is also illegal. He will not be the president of the NBP for a day longer. There will be no need for a law"" - argued the Leader of the Platform."
2569	43	"He reminded that legal obstacles related to the re-election of Glapiński for a second term in the National Bank of Poland were pointed out by experts from the Chancellery of the President. ""A much smaller doubt would be enough to lead the guest out of the NBP. And I will do it, I guarantee it to you,"" Tusk assured. Pursuant to the Act on the National Bank of Poland, a member of the NBP Management Board may not serve more than two terms of office. Before the election of Adam Glapiński for the second term of office as the head of the NBP, it was argued that he had already completed his two terms of office in the Bank's authorities, because in 2016 he had already been a member of the NBP for several months."
2569	45	"During his speech, he thanked everyone who was involved in, among others, in the Committee for the Defense of Democracy, they took to the streets. ""Thanks to you, the faith has survived that it is worth setting up your own committees and chasing arrogant authorities by organizing and organizing all people of good will,"" he pointed out."
2569	47	He recalled Jacek Kuroń's slogan: do not burn committees, set up your own, referring to the burning of the building of the Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in Radom in June 1976.
2569	49	"He also noted that it is in Radom that he can say that when he compares the image of Radom in 1976 and today's Poland, ""this image is so similar that it can lead to despair."""
2569	51	"He argued that PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński is ""a representative of power who mocks, humiliates, and despises people, often children, who need special tenderness."" He pointed to ""Kaczyński's cackle, this mockery of Kaczyński and people in power over the disabled."" ""Do you remember that press conference on the street because the disabled were not allowed to enter the Sejm? PiS told them: get out! The Sejm is for us, and you can organize in the street,"" he addressed the participants of the convention."
2569	53	We are also here so that the authorities will never again despise the weaker people, he said.
2569	55	"At the same time, he said: ""The moment will come when we will all organize ourselves in the street, if this power does not disappear."""
2569	57	"Referring to the rights of the weakest, ""those who need help, or at least understanding and respect,"" he said, ""there is zero tolerance and zero mercy for those who seek some rotten compromises here."" He announced that the program of the ""breaking with hypocrisy, with this hypocrisy, e.g. with this commission that investigates pedophilia."""
2569	59	As soon as we take power, as soon as we win the elections (…) it will not be the case that whether it is a politician, the Marshal of the Sejm, a bishop, a minister, a high official ... It will not be the case that in cases of child abuse, pedophilia, violence against children, they will some sacred untouchable cows, he said.
2569	61	They will no longer be sacred, untouchable cows. Only children in Poland are sacred and untouchable, he stressed.
2569	63	"The leader of the Civic Platform also reminded that he is a father and grandfather. ""And I turn to fathers and grandparents: if you have a daughter or granddaughter like me, you cannot vote for PiS for the love of God,"" Tusk stressed. ""They really gave hell to women and they will give hell to your daughters and your granddaughters,"" he added."
2569	65	"He argued that he was the addressee of many requests or alarms about what was happening in Polish homes because the current ruling team had no idea about life. ""I'm sorry to be brutal, but do you gentlemen: Kaczyński, Rydzyk, Jędraszewski, what do they know, for the love of God, about motherhood, fatherhood, family, sex, bed?"" Tusk asked, to which the hall reacted enthusiastically with thunderous applause."
2569	67	"He appealed to fathers and grandfathers to ""talk"" to their daughters and grandchildren. ""Really, they will tell you everything, coffee on the table"" - he encouraged. ""And I also say this as a Christian. People, if someone believes in God, feels like a Christian, he can vote for a party that has Mejza, Kurski ... What are we even talking about?"" - the head of the Platform was surprised."
2569	69	"Listen, can you vote for lies, theft, contempt, hatred? - He was asking. ""You believe in God, you don't vote for PiS, it's as simple as pie,"" he added."
2571	1	Grzegorz Braun about life and family - answers to questions to presidential candidates
2571	3	The candidate for president, Grzegorz Braun, was the first to answer the questions asked by the PRO Foundation. Below we publish the letter sent to the editorial office of our portal in its entirety.
2571	5	Ladies and Gentlemen,
2571	7	"Thank you for your letter - it will be easier for me to answer the questions posed in it, since, in fact, I have already answered them many times. Several times I had the opportunity to speak publicly on topics that, like you, I consider to be crucial for the fate of the Polish nation and state, or more broadly, the entire Latin civilization. As the author of documentaries commonly perceived as an unequivocal voice for life, and against inhumane eugenic theories and criminal abortion practices - incidentally, often encountering aggressive criticism from anti-Polish and anti-Catholic propaganda centers - I have given, I believe, a sufficiently strong expression of my principled position. Therefore, I refer all those interested in my views to the films: ""Eugenics - in the name of progress"" and ""Not about Mary Wagner"", in which, I hope, I managed to include a sufficiently broad argumentation and exemplification relating to almost all of your issue. However, I understand that submitting my candidacy in the upcoming presidential election creates a new situation in which it is understandable to expect that opinions previously disseminated in various publications (apart from films, also press, radio, etc.) will now be collected and clearly repeated - which is also hereby I do (reserving the numbering of the questions given by you)."
2571	9	"1. So, do I think that Polish law should protect every human being from conception? Yes Sir. I definitely think so. At the same time, I understand that when you talk about ""protecting a person"", you mean the legal protection of every human life - regardless of age, health, property status, etc. Indeed, the law cannot make any exceptions to this rule, which would result from an arbitrary assessment of ""quality"" or the level of other people's expectations of human life. (I make an exception, of course, for adults who deliberately put themselves outside the law, and that is: premeditated killers, traitors to the state, spies and deserters in the face of the enemy - giving these criminals a legal guarantee of life is monstrous and absurd claim - for the use of such cases, I firmly postulate the restitution of the capital punishment)."
2571	11	"In particular, do I believe that children suspected of having a disease or genetic defect can be killed by abortion? No, by no means. In the film ""Not about Mary Wagner"" I presented, I believe, a sufficiently broad argumentation and exemplification explaining such a position. The very concept of evaluating the possible “imperfections” of our fellow human beings and judging on that basis who “deserves” to live is in fact a horrendous claim – and in practical terms it leads, as we know, to the slaughter of the innocent. Therefore, I reject any legal solutions that make such practices unpunished. Therefore, I reject, which is obvious, the so-called ""abortion compromise"". I would like to remind you that this is a legal state that places us at the level of solutions in force in the Third Reich, where the law also did not allow for the murder of every child with impunity - ""only"" some children (sic)."
2571	13	2. Do I believe that anyone has a right to possess another human being? No. I vehemently reject such a claim.
2571	15	"In particular, do I believe that anyone has the right to have a child and, consequently, to produce one by in vitro fertilization? No, nothing like that. In the film ""Eugenics - in the Name of Progress"" I tried to show that the moment of selection, which inevitably occurs in the ""in vitro"" procedure, makes the whole procedure criminal, and advertising it - especially perfidious and wicked. By the way, it is worth noting that the legal acceptance of the practice of ""in vitro"" deprives the logical basis for opposition to abortion - if we agree to selection in this particular phase of life, on what grounds should we question the right to carry out the same selection in other phases? And maybe this is the point - maybe, apart from the obvious interests of the ""in vitro"" industry, its promoters also want this: to introduce legal permission for abortion through the ""kitchen door"", so to speak?"
2571	17	"3. Do you think that marriage and the family should be especially protected? Yes, in did. I believe that the attitude towards life, marriage and family is generally one of the main criteria of value, legitimacy and effectiveness of every legal system, every state, every civilization. By the way: for this very reason, I question the legitimacy of the current government of Warsaw (which, to avoid possible confusion, I do not call it Polish). This government allows, even initiates further hostile acts against the Polish family - acting against the natural law, undermining parental authority, creating a guaranteed demand for the services of the ""in vitro"" industry, implementing the ""gender"" ideology into the Polish legal system, initiating disinformation and the depravity of minors by state compulsory education, etc. etc. The Warsaw state (which I do not call Polish) implements a strategy of perfidious aggression aimed at the family - also when it promotes legal acts such as the ""anti-violence convention"", the authors of which want to make the traditional family the main suspect and the culprit of all pathologies (by the way, not only against nature, but also against all true, statistically recognizable realities of social life in Poland)."
2571	19	"Do you allow marriage to be called a union other than the union of a man and a woman? No, I don't allow it. As a normal Pole, I reject with a shrug any arbitrary, absurd, ideologically motivated and politically enforced manipulation of the semantic fields of any words. And as a certified Polish philologist, I recall the long tradition of language manipulation to achieve propaganda goals by regimes fighting our civilization - modifying, and sometimes even reversing the meanings of words is the essence of every totalniac ""newspeak""."
2571	21	4. Do you think that the state can forcibly educate children against the values ​​of their parents? In particular, can a state school encourage promiscuity, encourage perverted sexual relationships, promote infertile drugs, and encourage abortion? Apparently it can - since that's what it commonly does. I, on the other hand, condemn this state of affairs in principle and very willingly criticize it. Some of you may be familiar with my critical attitude towards state-owned, centralized, compulsory education. For years, I have been trying not to miss the opportunity to criticize the Kołłątaj-Stalinist teaching system operating in our country. In this context, my radically negative attitude to any theories and pedagogical practices questioning parental authority is obvious. Nota bene: the fact described in historiography is the particular emphasis put on the principle of state education by Masonic lodges - researchers are familiar with periodically repeated proclamations and directives of French Freemasonry of the 19th and 20th centuries on this matter. – precisely because without state coercion, the other principles of these organizations fighting against the Catholic and Polish tradition could not be so effectively transmitted and implemented.
2571	23	Each of the above issues, of course, deserves a more serious discussion and calls for broader argumentation - which I will omit here, understanding that you are not lacking in arguments, but you want to know my clear position on these matters. I hope I am not leaving any room for fundamental doubts here. If they do, however, I'll provide further explanations. First of all, however, please kindly note that, beyond my own judgment, I would like to rely primarily on the Traditional Teaching of the Catholic Church in this matter (as in any other matter) - and this is the context in which any of my comments should be interpreted.
2571	25	"Finally, please accept my most sincere thanks for your commitment, for your courageous appearance in Polish public life - with my wishes that the matters you are striving for will finally find successful conclusions. What we will not be able to achieve, however, if the law in the Republic of Poland is still made by people who despise human life and are not afraid of God - with the passive participation of much more numerous ""supporters of compromise"". This is a page of disgrace which, in the face of the approaching 1050th anniversary of the Baptism of Poland, it is time to finally turn around."
2577	1	Nowacka: We agree, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks
2577	3	I can't imagine that my party colleagues would let go of something they put so much effort into. Donald Tusk was skeptical, but he saw the scale of women's protests and accepted the position prepared by PO MPs, believes Barbara Nowacka.
2577	5	You win the election and what happens to abortion?
2577	7	The law must be liberalized. Bills are ready.
2577	9	Is the line of the Civic Coalition consistent? Does not seem.
2577	11	Is. But just changing the law is not enough: we need to introduce sex education, accessible contraception and a social campaign showing the truth.
2577	13	Truth?
2577	15	Yes. Some PiS voters are against the changes, because they have been subjected to propaganda for years. We must show what a ban on abortion is and what liberalization means.
2577	17	And what is the truth about liberalization?
2577	19	Such that every Polish woman will be able to terminate her pregnancy up to the 12th week.
2577	21	And this is supposed to reassure PiS voters?
2577	23	It is worth at least making them aware that these choices are made anyway, only in the gray area. We need to show what dramas bad law leads to. If we don't show it, the power's idea to tighten the screw may come up again.
2577	25	You are talking about finished projects. which ones?
2577	27	There is, for example, the Let's Save Women project.
2577	29	Was. As a citizen who lost in the Sejm.
2577	31	Yes, I submitted it myself as a civic initiative. It's gone, but it physically exists. It is complete - it includes the issues of sex education and the availability of contraception, it contains solutions regulating the conscience clause. That is what KO proposes as part of the Pact for Women.
2577	33	You want to ban the clause?
2577	35	No, that's the right of doctors. But you have to take into account the right of patients: they need to know who they are going to. Today they don't know and it's a lottery. Which translates not only to the issue of abortion, but also access to contraception.
2577	37	In the light of the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal on the anti-abortion act, is this draft unconstitutional?
2577	39	It is neither a tribunal nor a sentence. The body that issued it cannot create the law and interpret it. He is burdened with original sin, which means that he can be considered non-existent.
2577	41	So the first step KO would like to take would be changes to TK?
2577	43	There would certainly have to be a major reform. Transitional provisions would be needed in order not to undermine the system. But yes, this is the concept, specialists are working on it. And then, de facto, we would automatically return to the reality of the previous regulations, including those regarding abortion.
2577	45	You haven't won the elections so far, so it's hard to talk about your project's chances. But you are in the Sejm, and the issue of abortion, instead of being liberalized, has been tightened. What now?
2577	47	What can be done without violating the pseudo-judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal is to remove the record on the criminality of doctors. The most important thing is that they refer for prenatal tests. So that they would not be afraid of having an abortion for the sake of the woman's mental well-being. So that they would not be afraid to make decisions about saving women.
2577	49	What if the Supreme Court deals with the issue of psychological well-being in the context of abortion and decides that this is not a prerequisite in accordance with the Act?
2577	51	We have no chance to counteract this with the current government. The obliging judge Ziobro will issue a verdict, and everything will be accepted by the parliamentary majority.
2577	53	Is abortion a politically winnable topic?
2577	55	This is not a political issue, but a social one.
2577	57	But it has become political. Politicians must decide what is profitable for them in this matter.
2577	59	It pays to create a situation where women are safe. And this can be guaranteed by giving them the right to decide how many, with whom and when they will have children.
2577	61	It's profitable? So what?
2577	63	I cannot talk about issues fundamental to women's lives and health in terms of support columns.
2577	65	But you are a politician.
2577	67	If I were a PiS politician, I would not wonder if it pays to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people. This is not a matter of political calculation, but a necessity. Saying the party has to look at the polls as an explanation...
2577	69	But KO seems to do that. Marshal Kidawa-Błońska said this month that abortion is evil. And Tusk argued that a compromise would be a problem for the PO.
2577	71	You can't win an election over abortion. But they can be lost when Polish women die because they did not have access to the procedure.
2577	73	Or when he goes the other way and says they can have an abortion on demand?
2577	75	"There is no such thing as ""abortion on demand"", just a woman's decision: easy, difficult or very difficult."
2577	77	Maybe KO politicians are afraid that the society is conservative and will lose by talking about abortion openly?
2577	79	It's not so conservative anymore. Women are changing, the climate in small towns is also changing. This was evident in the protests.
2577	81	And yet KO must constantly talk about its political line on this issue.
2577	83	No! All 4 parties agree that abortion should be allowed up to 12 weeks. PO and Nowoczesna are for an additional condition, i.e. consultation with a psychologist. We will talk about the details.
2577	85	You can talk for a long time. How can you be sure that KO will change the law?
2577	87	I can see that many of our MPs have changed their attitude after the Constitutional Tribunal's verdict. A social change is also visible, a gigantic shift towards pro choice - more and more people are in favor of the liberalization of the law. Politicians, including conservative ones, are influenced by their wives and daughters, who are more aware that this is their life. The parties have also changed.
2577	89	So if KO wins, it will be a change?
2577	91	I can't imagine that my party colleagues would let go of something they put so much effort into. Donald Tusk was skeptical at first. But he saw the scale of women's protests and accepted the position prepared by PO MPs. We can certainly cooperate with the Left on this matter. However, there is a big question mark when it comes to PSL and Poland 2050 by Szymon Hołownia. They will be difficult partners.
2577	93	In your opinion, nothing will change in this term of the Sejm?
2577	95	"On the topic of abortion? No. Members of the United Right are on a short leash with Kaczyński. In this context, it promises to be very interesting to vote on the civic project ""Stop Abortion"", which says, among other things, about 25 years in prison for abortion. Also for women. Ryszard Terlecki said at the conference that they would reject the draft in the first reading. But he immediately added that there would be no discipline. So we will see how many PiS politicians are able to express their own opinion."
2577	97	That is, to be precise: the ruling majority may vote for the motion to reject the draft in the first reading, which it will submit ...
2577	99	Civic Coalition, probably also the Left.
2577	101	"The civic project tightening the law went to the Sejm, and on the other side is the civic project ""Legal abortion without compromise"" still without the required 100,000. signatures."
2577	103	Please ask the committee that collects them.
2577	105	But you were involved in a twin project, Save the Women.
2577	107	I chaired this committee twice and there was no problem with collecting signatures twice. Though I must admit it's hard work. The one you are asking about concerns women politicians of the Left and women's organizations, and the Polish Initiative (chaired by Nowacka - ed.) has not been invited. The Women's Strike bet on the Left. But we support, for example in my parliamentary office, you can sign it.
2577	109	Is this your diplomatic answer to the question about the lack of unity of the opposition or left-wing circles on the subject of abortion?
2577	111	"When I was collecting signatures for ""Let's Save Women"", there was no political unity either. I invited everyone to this initiative, because I believe that what counts is the cause, not the party banner. I cannot say why such a strategy around ""Legal Abortion"" was adopted today. Why were signatures not collected during recent demonstrations? Why haven't we been talked to about this? The fact that when we collected signatures in 2016 and 2017 there was no pandemic, the social atmosphere was heated. It gave me confidence that it would work. Also slow down the changes. Because let's remember that we also fought against attempts to increase penalties for abortion. And then it worked."
2577	113	And today? After the verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal and the events in the district hospital in Pszczyna, the atmosphere is not hot?
2577	115	"Today we have an atmosphere of despair. We are not coming out with offensive slogans of liberalization of the law, but with a dramatic appeal: ""#NeitherOneMore"". The truth is also that submitting bills in today's Sejm does not make sense, because PiS has as an argument the aforementioned judgment of the pseudo-tribunal. And he will say this: we reject the project because it is unconstitutional."
2577	117	"During the collection of signatures for ""Let's save women"", there was a different parliamentary arithmetic?"
2577	119	No, it was just as difficult. But then, in addition to collecting signatures, we were doing a gigantic social campaign showing the truth, i.e. what the abortion law looks like, what does it mean access to safe, legal abortion, how important is sex education and effective contraception. And also what is the situation of women who go to the doctor, and in the office they hear that there is a conscience clause.
2577	121	Are you in favor of deleting Art. 152 of the Penal Code, which says about punishment for making or assisting in an abortion?
2577	123	Yes, including comes down to the so-called rescue act. He's talking about decriminalizing abortion.
2577	125	Today, from this article, accusations are made against activists of women's organizations.
2577	127	These activists help in crisis situations when the state systematically turns its back on women. In a moment everything will be read as aiding. If a girl comes up to me on the street and I give her the number of Abortion Without Borders, will I also have to expect charges? Assistance in making the decision to have an abortion, in providing information about possible ways, should not be punishable.
2577	129	And the doctors? How do you assess their attitude today? On the one hand, they say they are afraid of prosecution charges. On the other hand, we hear allegations about washing hands.
2577	131	You can't blame them for the fact that the state is run by fanatics. Their fear is not unfounded. Therefore, our idea for the current situation is to provide doctors with a sense of security.
2577	133	How?
2577	135	We are starting a series of meetings with local government officials. We want to take advantage of their good practices, e.g. of Warsaw and the decision of the mayor of the city right after the Constitutional Tribunal's verdict - so that hospitals operate, so that they do not cover themselves with the conscience clause. We also need to organize legal aid for doctors. In the field of interpretation of the current regulations, as well as in ad hoc situations - this is also a task for local governments.
2578	1	Is abortion a human right or not? It's not the point
2578	3	It doesn't really matter whether we consider the right to abortion to be a fundamental right or not. It is important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute a violation of women's rights.
2578	5	I worked for some time at the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights. I have handled three Polish cases assigned to me by lot concerning the relationship between the Act of 1993 on family planning, protection of the human fetus and the conditions for the admissibility of abortion and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms - which has been part of the Polish legal order since 1993.
2578	7	There were three cases: a complaint by Alicja Tysiąc, a complaint by R.R. and a complaint by P. and S. All resulted in judgments in which the tribunal found that the Polish authorities had violated the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in relation to the women complainants. The right to respect for private life was violated, and in the case of P. i. S. – also the prohibition of inhuman treatment. For the purposes of these cases, I have cut my professional teeth on studying the consequences of banning or restricting access to legal abortion for human rights - in the dimension of national law, in the perspective of comparative law and international law.
2578	9	That is why it is with some annoyance that I read some legal enunciations about abortion today - because of the carelessness of the authors, the superficiality of their texts or the hard ideologization of the subject, resistant to the rules of the legal craft, and often also to facts. An example from the last few days: an interview with my talented colleague, attorney Tomasz Snarski, published by the Catholic Information Agency. I understand that KAI needs expert legitimacy for the content it publishes on the legal aspects of abortion. However, I have a serious problem with what Attorney Snarski says as an expert.
2578	11	Women's human rights
2578	13	"By employing the trick of glamorously stating as a fact that ""abortion is not a human right,"" he manages to overlook - or distract the reader from - that the legal permissibility of abortion shapes and affects the human rights of which the woman is the subject."
2578	15	"We read in the interview that ""when it comes to ensuring the protection of the state for women who may find themselves in a situation of having to terminate their pregnancy, there is no need to refer to human rights."" We will not find in Snarski's words information about the relationship between the way in which the law determines the admissibility of abortion and the human rights of a woman. As if this relationship did not exist, and the right to terminate pregnancy was, as Snarski says, a gracious ""exception"" or ""concession"" of the legislator. (By the way, presenting the right to abortion in this way is unbearably cheesy and, from a comparative law perspective, inaccurate; for example, in Canada, after the 1988 Supreme Court repeal of a law criminalizing abortion on the grounds of its unconstitutional character, no legislation was enacted at the federal or in individual provinces, which defined the conditions for the admissibility of abortion)."
2578	17	The issue is not whether legal abortion is a human right or not. The point is that the fundamental right to respect for a woman's private life applies to assessing how the law regulates access to legal abortion (as well as other reproductive health services). This right is guaranteed to every person by Art. 47 of the Constitution, Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in force in Poland, or Art. 7 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights - that I will mention only the most important acts of national or international law. It should also not be forgotten that respect for private life and protection against state interference have been part of the European and Anglo-Saxon legal tradition for centuries.
2578	19	So Tomasz Snarski – or the journalist interviewing him – makes his task easier. It does not attempt to answer the question of what is the relationship between the respect for a woman's private life guaranteed by law and the competing right that the fetus might be entitled to.
2578	21	"In 2018, the then ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, said in the context of parliamentary work on two civic projects, which, in the intention of the authors, were to change the law on the conditions for admissibility of abortion, that ""abortion is not a human right."" The point was, however, that these conditions were determined by the national legislator, as international law does not directly guarantee the right to abortion. Not that the issue of abortion is indifferent to women's human rights, as attorney Snarski now claims."
2578	23	We know that such a relationship exists, for example, from the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. He noted long ago that abortion legislation affects the sphere of private life, because whenever a woman is pregnant her private life becomes closely linked with the developing foetus. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (guaranteeing the right to respect for private life) cannot, in the Court's view, be interpreted as conferring the right to abortion, but the factual situations resulting from the existence of prohibitions or restrictions on access are subject to assessment as to whether a woman's right to respect for her private life has not been infringed by these prohibitions.
2578	25	Thus, it makes no difference whether we consider the right to abortion to be a fundamental right or not. It is important that the prohibition or restriction of this right may constitute a violation of women's rights. We will not find this information in the KAI interview.
2578	27	"""The principle of proportionality has not been adopted in Poland"""
2578	29	"Yes, there is mention of ""weighing certain values"". Meanwhile, we are dealing with a classic and often encountered in the practice of making and applying the law, a situation of competition worthy of protection of goods/values/rights."
2578	31	"The law has long known the means of settling such conflicts. Under Polish law, such an instrument is Art. 31 section 1 of the Constitution. It provides that ""restrictions on the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be established only by statute and only when they are necessary in a democratic state for its security or public order, or for the protection of the environment, health and public morals, or freedoms and the rights of others."" The principle of proportionality expressed in it, among others, is reflected in Article 32 of the European Charter of Human Rights and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights."
2578	33	A lawyer who respects the rules of the craft should not lose sight of this rule - as an instrument for resolving conflicts of goods/interests worthy of protection; as an instrument to achieve a fair balance between such goods. It also applies when it concerns a woman with an unwanted pregnancy, a pregnancy with a poor health prognosis for the woman herself and/or the fetus. It should at least mention it. It was the principle of proportionality that guided national legislators when, in the second half of the 20th century, they introduced laws in Europe and around the world legalizing abortion as a medical benefit.
2578	35	"It is not without reason that constitutionalists or human rights specialists sometimes bitterly say that ""the principle of proportionality has not been accepted in Poland"" as a professional instrument of subtle and precise weighing of competing goods and interests worthy of protection; as an instrument of seeking a just settlement; as a reflex of justice of people making and applying the law. The position presented by Attorney Snarski - that the right to life of the fetus must always and in every situation give way to any other right of a woman - is an expression of such disregard for the principle of proportionality. The radical character of this position is that it treats the fetus as a human being and abortion as taking a human life. However, we do not find out what exactly the ""search for optimal solutions in non-optimal conditions"" postulated by the lawyer would consist of - in terms of determining the legal admissibility of abortion. We also do not learn that the law may - and does - differentiate the scope of legal protection of the fetus depending on the stage of pregnancy development."
2578	37	"Speaking of these values ​​and interests, it is impossible not to notice that in the text devoted, inter alia, to the issue of the legal regulation of abortion, there is not a single sentence about what values ​​and interests of a woman worthy of legal protection are in favor of abortion. pregnancy was an available and legal medical benefit. Yes, we have a journalist's suggestion that such a good could be ""unlimited freedom for a woman"", to which Attorney Snarski replies with some indignation that there is no such thing as unlimited freedom - and rightly so."
2578	39	"It's just that, apart from ""unlimited freedom"", there are also other interests and goods of women that the ban on abortion may violate or annihilate. For example, personal autonomy. For example, the desire to shape one's own destiny in the intended way. For example, a sense of responsibility for the fate of children you already have. For example, the awareness that the birth of a sick child - statistically speaking - results in the fact that about 80 percent of men leave the family. But who would care about such whims. It's easier to just call them ""unlimited freedom."""
2578	41	Is the fetus subject to legal protection to the same extent as a human being?
2578	43	"Therefore, we do not find in the text information that the legal regulation of abortion has a direct impact on whether women's rights are observed and respected. Instead, we can read that “from the perspective of the concept of human rights that I share, the right to abortion is simply incomprehensible. It is difficult to understand how someone could have this right, understood as a human right. Because the consequence would be to say that the fetus, that is, the human before birth, is not a separate person. Next, we read about the rights of ""innocent, defenseless people, such as unborn children."""
2578	45	"Mec. Snarski thus glides smoothly over the issue of the status of the fetus, treating it as a ""human before birth"". As if in a legal sense it was obvious obviousness. For the purposes of this text, there is of course no need or opportunity to refer to the extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether a fetus is a human being in the sense that it deserves the same scope of protection as after birth. Suffice it to recall that this issue has been and remains the subject of considerable debate and controversy. It would be elegant to even mention this, rather than presenting the matter as if the opinion of the speaker - to which he is of course entitled - were the same as the conclusion of this debate. Because it just isn't."
2578	47	"After all, in the Polish legal literature there is a fundamental work - awarded by the editors of the prestigious monthly ""State and Law"" for the best doctorate - on the definition of the beginning of human life, differences in this matter between different legal systems and differences in international law itself. Dr. Jelena Kondratiewa-Bryzik (worked at the Center for Human Rights of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznań, died in 2012 in a train crash near Szczekociny) published a book entitled ""The beginning of the legal protection of human life in the light of international standards"" in 2009. The author presented a careful comparative law analysis of the way in which various acts of international law and the jurisprudence developed on their basis define this moment. These definitions are very diverse and cannot be reduced to a simple conclusion that a fetus is simply a human being, who is therefore entitled to the same legal protection before and after birth."
2578	49	"It would also be worth remembering the position of the European Court of Human Rights on this issue. According to it, at the European level ""there is no consensus on the nature and status of the embryo and/or fetus (...), although they are beginning to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequences of genetic engineering research, medically assisted procreation or embryo experimentation. At best, it can be considered common ground between states that the embryo/fetus belongs to the human race. The potentiality of this entity and its capacity to become a person - which enjoys civil law protection in many countries, such as France, in the context of inheritance and gifts, and in the United Kingdom ... - needs to be protected in the name of human dignity, without making a “person” having a “right to life” within the meaning of Article 2 of the [European Convention on Human Rights]'. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court is convinced that it is neither desirable nor even possible, as things stand, to give an abstract answer to the question of whether an unborn child is a person within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. 2 of the Convention [which guarantees the right to legal protection of life]”."
2578	51	It would be worth bearing this in mind before formulating a judgment on the legal status of the fetus as categorical as that of Attorney Snarski, and in addition - a judgment which, in the context of the interview, can be perceived as an expert, legal statement of facts. For those practicing the legal profession, the ability to distinguish between facts and judgments/evaluations is part of the basic professional toolkit. I have no doubt that Mr. Snarski possesses this skill, which his professional achievements are a convincing proof of. The credibility of his position would be enhanced if he avoided this awkwardness.
2578	53	It will not be out of place here to refer to the important professional success of Attorney Snarski. He represented the families of the victims of the Smolensk catastrophe before the European Court of Human Rights. The complaint concerned a violation of the right to respect for private and family life as a result of the exhumation of the victims' remains against the families' objections. The Strasbourg Court ruled that the exhumation constituted such a violation. Just as the Convention does not directly guarantee the “right to abortion”, it does not guarantee “the right not to exhume the bodies of relatives without the consent of the family”. But both are equally subject to evaluation: whether it was compatible with human rights.
2578	55	"Shooting acts to ""inherent human dignity"" are no longer enough"
2578	57	It is with great sadness that I make this last remark. I have no doubts about the sincere commitment of Dr. Snarski in the idea of ​​protecting human rights. However, the interview contains a significant omission. It has, in my opinion, the value of ethical omission.
2578	59	Today, in Poland, it is impossible to talk about the legal permissibility of termination of pregnancy, having swallowed water in the mouth as to the consequences of the ban on abortion due to fetal pathology. There are already two stories of young pregnant women who died in hospitals after the tribunal of Julia Przyłębska removed the embryopathological premise from the 1993 act. I expect from lawyers - and I consider it an important element of professional craft, which is often absent in Polish jurisprudence, which sometimes sins with theoretical beauty - the willingness and ability to reflect on the social consequences of the law in force.
2578	61	"And I expect from human rights lawyers that they are willing and able to see the real consequences of the applicable legal norms for the lives of real people. That they are not satisfied with soaring acts to ""inherent human dignity"", which in the face of the horror of today's situation of Polish women sound like copper."
2579	1	Kataryna: Why should abortion be morally neutral?
2579	3	"Girls to Girls: “The text »I support, but I would never have an abortion myself« emphasizes that abortions are something bad, something that should be avoided, something that should be as little as possible. What do you really mean by saying this sentence? Isn't it about protecting yourself from being judged by others?"""
2579	5	"The fight of pro-abortion circles - because calling them pro-choice has long since become obsolete - for the legalization of abortion quickly moved from the stage ""no one says that abortion is not good"" to the stage ""let no one say that abortion is wrong"". Now they force abstaining from moral evaluations of abortion, regardless of what was the reason for it and at what point in the pregnancy it was carried out. It is supposed to be morally neutral, even if the pregnancy is so advanced that the child is able to live independently outside the mother's body. After all, it is still a fetus and the right to talk about it as stuffing for dumplings will be defended by the progressive left as independence."
2579	7	"Representatives of the Abortion Dream Team write that ""abortion is one of the methods of fertility control, as important as contraception, and there is no reason for politicians, medicine or the market to dictate to us what is the better way to protect against unwanted pregnancy"". the right to abortion in certain circumstances, but have the audacity to say that they would not have an abortion themselves, the right to consider themselves pro-choice is being denied, because today pro-choice is no longer a fight for the right to abortion, it is a fight for the prohibition of its moral After all, it's just contraception, just as morally neutral as condoms. Thus, abortion lobbyists confirm exactly what they have been - allegedly unfairly - criticized for. Abortion for them is like cutting a fingernail. And it's not about changing the law, it's about permanently gagging It's good that we have clarity."
2579	9	"Do you know how the taboo of women smoking in public was broken in America? An advertising agency working for cigarette manufacturers organized a ""spontaneous"" women's march called the Torches of Liberty on Easter 1929. Proudly, they walked down Fifth Avenue in New York, convinced by greedy millionaires that they were fighting for their freedom, when in fact they fought for (and won) multiplication of profits Tobacco corporations have won for themselves only that today lung cancer is the second most malignant cancer in women, after breast cancer. an organization working for the right to abortion in countries where it is banned - they charge 70-90 euros for an abortion pill ""donations"". It's a potentially gigantic market if you manage to break the taboo completely."
2583	1	Pro-life voice: religious, philosophical, legal, biological and social arguments against abortion
2583	3	"Abortion has been one of the most divisive social problems for many years. Everyone speaks about it - from religious institutions, through biologists and ethicists, to philosophers. Often, however, the opinions expressed lack argumentation that could appeal to the average citizen. Nothing comes of such empty words. In the following article, we will present the reasons why abortion - especially ""on demand"" - should be stigmatized. First, some definitional issues need to be clarified. Since there is no medical term that unambiguously refers to all stages of the body's development between conception and birth, for the purposes of the following text, let's assume that we will use the terms ""fetus"" and ""[unborn] child interchangeably in this context, unless it does not follow otherwise."
2583	5	What is pro-life?
2583	7	The supporters of the restrictive abortion law are referred to as pro-life. Although in the popular opinion they are in favor of a complete ban on abortion, in reality this environment is not homogeneous. Some of the pro-life movement allow termination of pregnancy in special cases (e.g. when the life of the mother is in danger), while others are even against artificial methods of birth control (e.g. hormonal contraception). It is much safer to say that the general goal of this community is not to make abortion illegal, but to minimize the frequency of abortions. This can be achieved both by tightening the law (if the current one seems too liberal) and by maintaining the status quo (eg if the government is trying to liberalize existing provisions). Pro-life does not want to allow for a situation of social consent to abortion, which in consequence could turn into further and uncontrolled shifting of the border of deciding about human life or death.
2583	9	I. Religious authorities agree
2583	11	"In Poland, about 94% of citizens are Roman Catholics (according to the publication of the Central Statistical Office ""Religious denominations in Poland 2012-2014""). Of course, this does not mean, as some people think, that the other 6% must blindly submit to the morality imposed by the majority. However, since so many of us accept the teachings of the Church, it is worth finding out what the holy books and people we consider authorities think about abortion."
2583	13	Decalogue and Catechism of the Catholic Church
2583	15	"You do not have to look far, because the Decalogue already says directly: do not kill. The fifth commandment protects the life of every human being from conception to natural death, hence the position of Catholics is unchanging and clear - both on the issue of abortion and euthanasia. However, as we know (or at least we should know), biblical records are not always to be taken literally. So let's refer to the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church"" - the official interpretation of the doctrine of faith and moral principles of the Church, written in a simple language understandable to everyone and published in 1992. It is therefore a relatively new document and approved by the then Pope, John Paul II. The aforementioned fifth commandment of the Decalogue is developed here in nearly 80 points, but only six of them are of particular interest to us: points 2270 to 2275 specifically deal with the issue of abortion. So how does the ""Catechism"" address this issue? Already at point 2270 we get a clear and exhaustive answer:"
2583	17	Human life should be respected and protected in an absolute way from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being should be granted the rights of a person, among them the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.
2583	19	Further points develop this thesis: From the beginning, the Church has held that it is morally wrong to terminate a pregnancy by any means. The teaching on this subject has not changed and remains unchanged. Direct abortion, that is, willed as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law (2271). The Catechism refers to on Didache, one of the oldest Christian texts: Thou shalt not kill a fetus by abortion, nor kill a newborn (Didache 2:2).
2583	21	Formal cooperation in abortion is a serious offence. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. Anyone who procures an abortion, after having obtained its effect, is excommunicated by the law itself, by the mere fact of committing the crime, under the conditions provided by law (2272). The inalienable right to life of every innocent human being is a constitutive element of civil society and its legislation: The inalienable rights of the person shall be recognized and respected by civil society and political authority. (…) Among these fundamental rights are (…) the right to life and physical integrity of every human being from the moment of conception until death. (…) As an expression of the respect and care due to the child to be born, from the moment of its conception, the legislation should provide for appropriate penal sanctions for any voluntary violation of its rights (2273). Some homegrown critics of the anti-abortion law claim that Roman Catholic doctrine does not allow absolutely any intervention during pregnancy, including, among others, abortion. prenatal testing. This is, of course, utter nonsense, as the last two points say: Since the embryo should be considered a person from the moment of conception, its integrity should be defended, cared for and treated as much as possible like any other human being. Prenatal diagnosis is morally permissible if it “respects the life and integrity of the human embryo and fetus, seeks to protect or treat it individually (…) It is against the moral law when, depending on the results, it leads to termination of pregnancy. Diagnostics should not result in a death sentence (2274). Like any medical procedure on a patient, procedures on the human embryo should be considered acceptable provided that they respect the life and integrity of the embryo without exposing it to disproportionately great risks; when they are taken to treat, improve his health or to save a life in danger (2275).
2583	23	"So what are the conclusions from reading the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church""? human life is protected from the moment of conception, abortion is unquestionably wrong and immoral, prenatal examinations and procedures on embryos are absolutely permitted, as long as they do not endanger the life of the mother and child."
2583	25	Mother Teresa and John Paul II
2583	27	Mother Teresa of Calcutta, one of the most influential figures in the history of world peace, was also very critical of abortion. An excerpt from her 1979 Nobel Peace Prize speech is often quoted: The greatest threat to peace today is abortion. If a mother is allowed to kill her own child, what's to stop you and me from killing each other? Unborn children are the poorest of the poorest. Finally, let us return to John Paul II. Three years after approving the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Pope published Evangelium Vitae, an encyclical on the value and inviolability of human life. In it, he condemned abortion as a cruel crime:
2583	29	All kinds of homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, and voluntary suicide… all these and similar things and practices are shameful; by infecting human civilization, they dishonor those who commit them more than those who are harmed, and they are most contrary to the honor due to the Creator.
2583	31	"John Paul II also said that in the case of an inherently unjust law, which is the law that allows abortion and euthanasia, one must never comply with it ""nor participate in shaping public opinion favorable to such a law, or show support for it by voting"". It is worth noting that many Catholics treat the teachings of the Church very selectively, treating them as an excuse only on very specific issues. This is not what true faith is about. By giving the opinion of religious authorities only when it fits our beliefs, we distort the idea of ​​religion. The position of the Church is and has always been clear: abortion is an absolute and ruthless evil."
2583	33	Abortion in other religions
2583	35	What about the other six percent that are not covered by this interpretation? Other religions are also critical of abortion.
2583	37	Different branches of Christianity
2583	39	Orthodoxy, like Catholicism, shares the view that human life begins at conception. Abortion is therefore treated as murder. Many Protestant denominations, mainly Orthodox, hold a similar opinion. The largest Protestant Church in Poland, the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland, in a statement from 1991 strongly advocated the protection of life from the moment of conception and opposed the use of early-term abortion pills. Churches associated in the Evangelical Alliance are also against abortion. The Southern Baptist Convention is an outright opponent of abortion.
2583	41	Jehovah's Witnesses are against abortion: God considers life sacred. He already sees the embryo as a separate human being. King David was inspired to write about God: “Your eyes have even seen my embryo.”​—Psalm 139:16. At one time, God declared that anyone who harms an unborn child will be held accountable. Thus, in God's eyes, killing such a child is murder (Exodus 20:13; 21:22, 23).
2583	43	Buddhism
2583	45	Although Buddhism does not have an official interpretation on abortion, many monastic codes - referring to traditional scriptures - recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life. For this reason, abortion, as a conscious destruction of this life, is treated as something wrong. Theravada and Vajrayana monks are disfellowshipped for assisting in abortions. The current Dalai Lama also advocates a negative view of abortion, saying that it is an act of murder, so according to the teachings it should be stigmatized. It is also worth mentioning that traditional Buddhist scriptures do not differ in the approach to early and late abortion - each case is associated with negative moral or karmic consequences.
2583	47	Hinduism
2583	49	"Traditional Hindu texts condemn abortion. This crime is treated, depending on the sources, on a par with breaking the vow of chastity (Mahanarajana Upanishad), as worse than killing one's own parents (Kaushitaki Upanishad), and even equal to killing a brahmin priest (which in Hinduism is one of the heaviest crimes if not the heaviest). A woman who has an abortion risks losing her caste status. The abortion itself is called bhrūṇahatya (fetal murder), and the person who performs it is called bhrūnahan (killer of a learned brahmin). In Hinduism, life begins at conception. Abortion therefore causes the death of a person, and this violates the principle of faith, ahimsa (the term literally means ""non-harming"")."
2583	51	Religions say a firm 'no' to abortion
2583	53	Most major religions therefore have a clear and negative stance on abortion. Human life begins at conception, so any interference that causes the death of an embryo or fetus is reprehensible in one way or another. It is worth noting that in most cases the murder of an unborn child is treated at least on an equal footing - and sometimes even as a more serious crime - than the murder of a born person. Of course, as noted earlier, we absolutely should not impose the morality of our religion on others, but if we profess a given faith, we should live according to its guidelines - and those regarding abortion are usually clear.
2583	55	II. The law protects the fetus
2583	57	The issue of abortion is not top-down regulated by EU law, so it remains within the competence of the member states.
2583	59	Constitution of the Republic of Poland
2583	61	The Constitution of the Republic of Poland of April 2, 1997 reads: The Republic of Poland provides every person with legal protection of life (Article 38) and Everyone is equal before the law (Article 32(1)). So it remains only to define the moment when a man is created. The Constitution does not answer this question (mainly because it is a general act), but the Constitutional Tribunal does. In the decision of May 28, 1997 (reference number K 26/96) we read:
2583	63	The value of the constitutionally protected legal good, which is human life, including life developing in the prenatal phase, cannot be differentiated. There are no sufficiently precise and justified criteria to make such a differentiation depending on the stage of development of human life. From the moment of its creation, human life becomes a constitutionally protected value. This also applies to the prenatal phase.
2583	65	This position was also upheld 7 years later (judgment of 7 January 2004, reference number K 14/03): All possible doubts as to the protection of human life should be resolved in favor of this protection (in dubio pro vita humana). This means that human life - a clear analogy to religious interpretations can be noticed - begins from the moment of conception, and if it is not known whether a given action (here: abortion) interferes with the protection of this life, it should be assumed that it is.
2583	67	Convention on the Rights of the Child
2583	69	And if the Polish interpretation - according to pro-choice circles contaminated with Catholic thinking - is not enough, let's reach for a much wider document: the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This agreement was ratified by Poland as early as 1991, and what is more, it was Poland that proposed the UN Human Rights Commission to adopt it and presented the draft. In its provisions, the Convention repeats the postulate of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child adopted in 1959: The child, due to his physical and mental immaturity, requires special care and attention, including appropriate legal protection, both before and after birth. The last fragment is important because it also grants the aforementioned rights to the child in the womb. The Convention does not clearly define when a child begins. Again, the principle of in dubio pro vita humana can be invoked - the provision on legal protection before birth is a sufficient condition to recognize that the organism is subject to this protection from the moment of conception, and not an imaginary point in time.
2583	71	III. Uncertain position of biologists
2583	73	"The biological point of view has one fundamental flaw: even pro-abortionists admit that it is impossible to clearly determine at what point in development we are dealing with a human being. Therefore, they resort to such abstract concepts as identifying humanity with consciousness, with independence from the mother's body, with the feeling of pain, or they simply set a certain arbitrary age of the fetus, beyond which we have full rights to life, and before it - no rights. This type of argumentation is not only ridiculous, but also ignorantly selective - which will be discussed in more detail in the section devoted to philosophical issues. So let's leave this argument unproven for the moment. Let's turn off emotions, turn on thinking and approach the matter rationally. In a simplification, we can assume - regardless of our views on the issue of abortion - that every living being is a set of genes, and a set of very strictly defined ones. A human being (again, for the sake of simplicity, we omit, for example, genetic diseases as irrelevant to the evidence) has 46 chromosomes - 23 from the father and 23 from the mother. Since human reproductive cells can only come into contact with other human reproductive cells (despite ambitious attempts, scientists have failed to fertilize even the closest biological relatives of Homo sapiens), it is obvious that an organism formed by the interaction of male and female human gametes and possessing 46 chromosomes make a human. An 80-year-old man has 46 chromosomes. An 18-year-old boy has 46 chromosomes. A newborn baby has 46 chromosomes. A three-month-old fetus has 46 chromosomes. So the question should be asked: how many chromosomes does the newly formed embryo have? Of course, we all know the answer. There are 46 of them - already at the moment of union, the zygote has a full set of chromosomes. At the DNA level, even the zygote - and even more so the embryo and fetus - are creations on a par with an adult individual. If it is wrong to kill the latter, then why is it justified to kill its earlier form? The scientific, not the emotional, approach to biology thus confirms both religious and legal arguments. We are de facto human at conception. Not after birth, not as a fetus, not as an embryo, but after conception. Therefore, under the applicable law, we are entitled to the same protection as an adult. Another argument cited by the pro-choice community is that the fetus or embryo is an integral part of the mother's organism, because it develops inside her and is connected to her by the umbilical cord. You couldn't be further from the truth. A child is an absolutely separate being - it has separate organs (when they are created), often a different blood type, and above all - and here we return to the scientific essence of humanity - a different genetic code. Two different DNA codes always result in two separate organisms. It is even more absurd to invoke the ""existential dependence of the fetus on the mother"" and the symbiotic relationship. The weaker Siamese twin may be existentially dependent. Does this give the stronger twin the right – as the one who “mothers” in a way – to decide the fate of the weaker one? So why do we let the mother do this?"
2583	75	IV. Society less and less favorable to abortion
2583	77	Since the introduction of the 1993 Act, the attitudes of Poles have become increasingly conservative. In 2006, for the first time, the advantage of abortion opponents over supporters was noted. Even in 2009, every third Pole allowed for the possibility of termination of pregnancy. Four years later - only every fourth. The trend of moving away from abortion on demand from year to year is more and more clearly visible.
2583	79	"The CBOS communiqué ""Abortion in various situations"" from May 2016 clearly indicates that Poles are against killing unborn children. As many as 65% of respondents believe that the mother's minor age is not an argument for abortion. Only every fifth Pole has a different opinion. There is even less social acceptance for abortion due to a difficult personal situation (80% against) or financial situation (81% against)."
2583	81	Interestingly, household income per capita does not significantly differentiate opinions on abortion due to poor financial situation. People with an income of PLN 649 or less per capita are 80% against abortion in such a case, and people with an income of PLN 1,000-1,399 – in 84%. This gives the lie to the statement that the greatest opposition is expressed by those who cannot be directly affected by this situation. Respondents with lower income also speak negatively about abortion among people with a similar financial status. As reported in the Communication: 54% of people strongly oppose the admissibility of abortion in a situation where a woman simply does not want to have a child. In total, 12% of Poles declare that abortion should then be allowed, and 78% are of the opposite opinion. Opinions on abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy are similar (without indicating the reason). Three quarters of the respondents (74%) believe that termination of pregnancy should not be allowed, and 13% are willing to accept it.
2583	83	It is therefore clear that over the years Polish society has matured and gained awareness. The number of opponents of abortion is systematically growing. In the common opinion, this is a morally reprehensible phenomenon, for which there is no public consent. We live in a democratic country, and this implies two important issues: respect for decisions made by the majority (since the vast majority treat abortion as evil - like any other murder - directed against another human being, this should be reflected in the law); respecting the rights of the weaker party (in this case, the weaker party is the unborn children who must be protected).
2583	85	Social pathologies resulting from the legalization of abortion
2583	87	"Society is opposed to abortion on demand because it perpetuates pathological patterns of behavior. Treating a child as a commodity that must be free from blemishes (and yet the slightest physical or mental disability is already an argument for termination of pregnancy) directly leads to abortion for other reasons - inappropriate sex (in India selective abortion is already a fact), eye color , the presence of this or that recessive gene. If the unborn child does not fit our idealized image of a descendant, it is easier to ""scrape"" it than to have, for example, a red-haired son instead of a blonde-haired daughter. From here it is only a step to negative eugenics, an example of which we had in the first half of the 20th century right under our noses. By taking away our unborn child's right to life only because he will be born deaf or with Down's syndrome, do we not become, in a sense, the continuators of the German Action T4?"
2583	89	VI. Abortion and the demographic problem
2583	91	"It is assumed that generational replacement is possible when the fertility rate oscillates around 2.1. In Poland, we have been dealing with a demographic low for a long time - and not just any low. According to ""The World Factbook"" data for 2015, the fertility rate in Poland was only 1.33 - it was the 215th result in the world out of 224 countries. This means that from generation to generation the population of Poles is decreasing by one third. The implications of a low fertility rate are predictable and visible now. According to the report of the Central Statistical Office ""Population forecast for the years 2014-2050"": Lower fertility means a smaller number of children born, which in turn leads to a decrease in the percentage of young people in the population, which results in increasing social benefits for the elderly, worsening economic situation of young people and, as a result, a low fertility rate or its decline."
2583	93	This phenomenon is called the low fertility trap. Needless to say, one of the sources of this state of affairs is abortion. In 2014, according to the report of the Council of Ministers, nearly 1,000 such procedures were performed in Poland. Of course, this number only refers to legal cases, which are just the tip of the iceberg. Supporters of the pro-choice movement estimate the scale of the abortion underground at up to 200,000 abortions a year. This is more than half of the number of live births in 2014. If this procedure were limited to individual cases, the fertility rate would approach 2.0.
2583	95	Legalization (is not) a recipe for everything
2583	97	Of course, you can raise your voice that forbidden fruit tastes best (there is a very perverse joke lurking somewhere in this statement), and the best method of fighting the abortion underground - and thus low birth rate - is ... full legalization of abortion. One can refer to Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, which completely deregulated the state. But life is not as simple as some people make it out to be. Contrary to the belief of some circles, abortion is not a procedure of first necessity. It's a luxury. Erase - and again dark humor looks around the corner - the mistakes of the previous evening, week or month. Many aspects of life are forbidden by law, and yet we have not fallen into ruin. The streets are not full of drunk high school students (after all, alcohol is allowed from the age of 18), and there are no notorious heroin users in the stairwells. If the real source of all evil was the prohibition of doing it, each of us would have a moonshine brewery, an ammunition depot and a methamphetamine production camper. However, this is not the case. Allowing the sale of home-produced alcohol will not make people stop drinking. Legalizing abortion will not make the underground disappear.
2583	99	Does abortion protect against overpopulation?
2583	101	"The threat of overpopulation of the world, so eagerly cited by pro-choice circles, is also a myth. The global fertility rate is only ... 2.42 (according to ""The World Factbook""). It is true that in the 20th century we saw a huge jump in population - from 1.6 to over 6 billion - but today this growth is no longer exponential. It is estimated that in 2100 there will be ""only"" 11 billion of us, which is only 4 billion more than today. If living conditions in the poorest regions of the world - mainly in Africa - are improved, this ratio should fall further. After all, as many as 32 of the top 33 countries in the ranking are located on this continent - and the last of them, Madagascar, has an indicator twice as high as required for generational replacement. Improving the living conditions would certainly reduce it, as it would be associated with lower child mortality and longer life expectancy."
2583	103	VII. Post-abortion grief – do women feel remorse?
2583	105	"The monograph ""Abortion - between ideology and individual experience"" by Ewelina Wejbert-Wąsiewicz (recognized by the Polish Sociological Association as the best scientific book in the field of sociology in 2011) shows that this procedure has an undoubted impact - and a negative impact - on the later lives of would-bes parents. The book presents a list of reasons for abortion along with the degree of ""post-abortion regret"" resulting from it."
2583	107	It is clear that the vast majority of cases are accompanied by pathological grief - this means that abortion is not indifferent to women and causes heavier rather than lighter feelings. On the internet forum addressed to post-abortion women, on the basis of which the above table was created, one can see, among others, such statements (original spelling): (...) I cut my hands from despair and helplessness (...) my child... forgive me, I hope that I will fix it all... that God will help me... how could I fail like that... (...) I I killed... deserves to die (...) I want to have a child... give him this love... I would give my life for one more chance! The whole situation is not helped by the fact that in Poland there is a lack of good, professional psychological help and gynecological care. Thus, women's post-abortion suffering is even stronger than it could be if an adequate level of medical services was maintained (which does not imply, however, that lesser suffering justifies termination of pregnancy in some way). On the other hand, the monograph also mentions cases when women felt absolutely no guilt for the act they had committed. Abortion for them was almost a cosmetic procedure, like a peeling of exfoliating epidermis. If they got pregnant again, they would kill another fetus without batting an eyelid.
2583	109	If not abortion, then what?
2583	111	Foster family
2583	113	The first solution that comes to mind as an alternative to abortion is a foster family. It is said that this is a very difficult, complex and long procedure, but the report of the Intervention Pre-Adoption Center (March 2013) shows that as many as 97% of the charges went to the family environment - including over 91% to foster and natural families. The average length of stay in the IOP of a child left by its mother in the hospital is only 61 days. In a situation where every fifth married couple has problems with getting pregnant, accepting a child for adoption seems to solve several issues at the same time - it limits the scale of abortion, allows the child to live (who is not guilty of anything in itself) and enables it to be raised by people who for various reasons, they cannot have biological offspring.
2583	115	The window of life
2583	117	Mothers wishing to renounce their own child may be terrified of the disclosure of their data. In the hospital you have to sign the appropriate papers and expose yourself to the label (in this respect we are still stuck in the deep Middle Ages) of a degenerate mother. So if not open adoption, then maybe the so-called. windows of life? The window of life is a place where the mother can anonymously leave the baby - opened from the outside, heated, with adequate ventilation. Its opening activates a signal that informs the person on duty about the appearance of a child. Then it is enough to place them in an incubator, notify the hospital, conduct tests (and with them the procedures for granting identity and the adoption process) and wait for the interested family. Windows of life may not be a particularly common solution - according to the Opoka Foundation, from 2006 to 2013 they saved only 64 children - but after all, every life here is worth its weight in gold. Every child in the window of life is one less child in the cabbage barrel.
2583	119	Smart education
2583	121	"However, these are only - or even - ad hoc actions. As the paremia attributed to Hippocrates says, morbum evitare quam curare facilius est - prevention is better than cure. What's the best way to prevent an abortion? In the same way that can prevent unwanted pregnancies (and no, we still consider abortion as a method of contraception wrong): through proper sex education. It is an open secret - although very terrifying in 21st-century Europe - that the majority of unplanned conceptions result from ignorance of one's own body. Myths such as ""if I pull it out, you won't get pregnant"" or ""you can't get pregnant the first time"" - and even such implausible ""methods"" of contraception as jumping on one leg after intercourse to shake the sperm out of the body - are still present in the consciousness of society . This is due both to the treatment of sex as a taboo subject - especially in intergenerational relations - and to the inappropriate approach of the institutions that shape us during our school years. We gain sexual education in contacts with peers, on pornographic websites and in the section with letters to the editor of popular youth magazines. By creating a sensible educational program in schools, we have a much better chance of fertilizing the minds of youth before those youth will hastily inseminate each other's bodies. This, of course, requires effort - an effort incomparably greater than the statutory ban on abortion practices and the introduction of conscience clauses at every stage, from the gynecologist to the lady in the pharmacy - but if we want to have a healthy functioning state, this effort cannot be avoided."
2583	123	Awareness of your actions
2583	125	"Naturally, it would also be untrue to say that every abortion is a depravity in every respect. Certainly, sometimes there are legitimate reasons when abortion is for the greater good. Certainly, the higher good is not the earlier lack of brain in the would-be parent (because first, that the child is not to blame for anything here, and two, that you have to take responsibility for your actions) or the so-called ""accident"" (ut supra). When deciding to have intercourse - even if in practice it is hormones and not brain cells that guide our behavior - you should be aware of the possible consequences. Solving a potential problem after the fact through surgery or the morning-after pill is as legitimate as running over a police officer who pulled you over for drunk driving."
2583	127	And above all, common sense
2583	129	And that's what it all comes down to. Appropriate sex education, treating the fetus as a human, not a new model of a toy (a child with suspected physical disability or, for example, Down syndrome, in principle qualifies for the procedure - due to our history, you do not even need to pronounce the name of a person who had very similar views out loud; do we really want to be the leader with the specific mustache on a micro scale?), taking consequences for our actions - only this much, or as much, is enough to work out a reasonable compromise. The anti-abortion act will then counteract pathology, just as the act on upbringing in sobriety counteracts extreme cases, not a conscious citizen who wants to drink a glass of wine with dinner.
259	1	OSW expert: Russian troll factories are trying to show Ukrainian refugees in a negative light.
259	3	"""Issues in Polish-Ukrainian relations, especially historical events, are eagerly used by Russian propaganda to divide Poles and Ukrainians,"" said Katarzyna Chawryło, an expert at the Warsaw Center for Eastern Studies (OSW). She added that the Kremlin's propagandists are trying to spread the negative message about refugees to all EU countries."
259	5	so-called troll factories also reach and will reach in the coming months for content that shows Ukrainian refugees in Poland in a negative light - she added.
259	9	The exploitation of threads concerning Ukrainian citizens fleeing to the West has a broader dimension and is not only related to Poland. Propagandists are trying to reach societies in EU countries by disseminating content that would imply that refugees are a source of danger - this is to lead to a situation where they (refugees - RMF FM's note) will not be welcome. The current situation (the war between Russia and Ukraine - RMF FM) makes rhetoric aimed at refugees an important element in the Kremlin's disinformation message. Its overriding goal is to minimize the West's support for Ukraine, stressed Chawryło.
259	11	The Russian narrative has a significant presence in Hungary, Serbia and partly in Germany.
259	13	According to the analyst, the so-called troll factories (state-controlled companies publishing propaganda content on the Internet, mainly on forums and social networks - RMF FM's note) are still employing new people, which indicates the intensification of the Kremlin's activities in the field of information warfare.
259	15	The expert emphasized that the Kremlin's long-term investment in favorable expert and media circles in the West is currently not bringing the expected results. The war with Ukraine completely changed the situation, even turned it upside down. First, the scale and brutality of Russian crimes against civilians in Ukraine are obvious and difficult to defend. Secondly, the EU and US sanctions against the Russian media, resulting in the limitation of their broadcasting in Western countries, have significantly reduced the scope of the propaganda's influence. As far as European countries are concerned, however, the Russian narrative has a significant impact in Hungary and Serbia, and partly also in Germany, assessed Khawryło.
259	17	Trips that some journalists like to take.
259	19	"The interlocutor drew attention to the ""usefulness"" of some Western journalists in the broadcast of the regime on Russian television."
259	21	"The Kremlin organizes study trips for such people to the occupied territories, e.g. to Mariupol. Recently, they have participated in journalists from Germany and France, as reported by Russian television. These are representatives of niche media, but their presence is enough to build a propaganda message on Kremlin television about ""objective Western reporters, striving for the truth, despite the censorship prevailing in the West,"" said the analyst."
259	23	Do Russians Trust TV? The results of the survey are not reliable.
259	25	According to an expert from the Warsaw-based center, the recently published survey of Russian public opinion, conducted by the international company GroupM and showing the decline in Russian confidence in state television, should not be treated as representative. The study was valuable because it confirmed the trend observed for years - television remains the main source of information for Russians, but trust in it is decreasing. However, only respondents from large cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants took part in this survey. inhabitants, therefore the results cannot be regarded as authoritative. In the Russian provinces, where Putin enjoys the greatest support, television plays a much greater role than in urban centers, the analyst explained.
259	27	"The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach residents with ""appropriate"" content."
259	29	"Khavrilo also referred to the propaganda ""cover"" of Russian activities in the occupied territories of eastern and southern Ukraine."
259	31	"The invaders do not spread any subtle message there, but rely on strictly force solutions to intimidate the inhabitants. Included in this scheme are switching off Ukrainian television and replacing it with Russian programs, as well as destroying access to Ukrainian internet connections and mobile networks. The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach the inhabitants with ""appropriate"" pro-Russian content - for example, there are reports that ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" (a daily publishing propaganda content) is distributed along with humanitarian aid - emphasized the OSW expert."
2590	1	ZChR to Solidarna Polska: Let's organize public space together, getting rid of symbols of foreign power
2590	3	"– Today, we are handing over this project to Solidary Poland, which, having 20 deputies, can submit it to the marshal's cane, so that from spring 2023 there will be no monument-like object in public space that glorifies the Red Army, the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"", the People's Army Polish or even Otto von Bismarck. Current solutions enable the defense of objects of glory by numerous local governments, e.g. Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn. If the parliament accepts our project, then on January 1, 2023, all such objects would be under the ownership supervision of the competent voivode and if they are currently in the register of monuments, they will be removed from it. This will allow you to delete these objects. Naturally, this project is also a commensurate reaction to the removal of Polish flags from Polish war cemeteries in Miednoje and Katyn by the Russians. Importantly, the objects of foreign glory in question will no longer be legally protected as monuments, and therefore will not be covered by the disposition of Art. 261 of the Penal Code. We are counting on Solidarna Polska's favor in this matter - tells us Paweł Czyż, spokesman for the Union of Christian Families. INTERVIEW WITH CHR SPOKEMAN"
2590	5	Independent Gazeta Obywatelska: Ombudsman, where did this initiative come from?
2590	7	"ZChR spokesman Paweł Czyż: Well, the troops of the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine. At the same time, some local governments defend monuments of gratitude to the Red Army, for example, the authorities of the Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn communes. Such actions must be stopped and hundreds of totalitarian symbols as well as Prussian militarism removed. Few people know that on Polish territory we still have the so-called ""Bismarck towers"", i.e. objects built to commemorate the Chancellor of the Reich Otto von Bismarck, e.g. in Działdowo, Dzierżoniów, Jańska Góra, Lębork, Mrągowo, Okonek, Ostróda, Szczecin, Świdwin, Świebodzin, in Wieleń, Sobótka, Zielona Góra, Żagań and Żary. It's a mockery that all these symbols litter our cities. Also, the Polish People's Army does not deserve to be commemorated. On September 17, 1939, the USSR actually became a participant in World War II as an ally of the Third Reich. Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski expressed the view that Russia had betrayed by going armed to help the Germans and striking us in the back with a knife at the agreed moment: ""(...) henceforth we are at war with the Soviets on an equal footing with the Germans."" On April 25, 1943, Stalin severed relations with the legal Polish government. It should be mentioned that the President of the Republic of Poland, Władysław Raczkiewicz, refused to sign the agreement of July 30, 1941 Sikorski-Majski, and therefore the Red Army's re-entry into the territory of the Second Polish Republic in 1944-45 took place without the formal consent of the legal Polish government, i.e. it constituted the implementation of the premises of illegal occupation. In June 1943, the Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, General Władysław Sikorski, recognized Berling's army as a ""Polish communist division of a diversionary character"", its creator himself as a ""traitor who deserted from the Polish Army"". Since we are not commemorating the Polnische Wermacht - the armed forces of the Kingdom of Poland established under the act of November 5, in the period from April 10, 1917, when Austria-Hungary transferred the Polish Auxiliary Corps under the orders of the General Governor of Warsaw, Hans Hartwig von Beseler, to October 13, 1918. – there is no reason to commemorate the so-called 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"" or the Polish People's Army. Dot. What is very important, no one will be prosecuted for their alleged damage under Art. 261 of the Penal Code."
2590	9	NGO: You count on the support of Solidarna Polska. But what about PiS?
2590	11	"Paweł Czyż: It will turn out, however, some Law and Justice politicians were susceptible to the communist legend that Berling's army is our Polish armed forces. It happens that PiS politicians lay flowers at the monuments of the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"". It is said that Poles served in this formation. This is clear, but no part of the 1st or 2nd Army of the ""Polish Army"" in general is due. It is as if we were officially constantly undermining the position of the legal Polish authorities in London. It's time to put the historical facts in order and we hope that the parliamentarians of Solidarna Polska will ""behave themselves"". It is worth emphasizing that in the case of Red Army monuments in Mikolin, in the Lewin Brzeski commune or in Olsztyn, MP Janusz Kowalski from the SP came with considerable help. Therefore, we appeal to Zbigniew Ziobro's party: let's organize public space together, getting rid of the symbols of foreign power."
2591	1	German MP: We need to return to talks with Russia about launching Nord Stream 2
2591	3	“The federal government (in Berlin) must now do everything to ensure the energy supply. We need to talk with Russia, despite the war that violates international law, about putting Nord Stream 2 into operation for a certain period of time, if gas supplies cannot be guaranteed in any other way,” said Ernst.
2591	5	"“A gas supply interruption could irreversibly damage Germany's +industrial backbone+,” he added. In his opinion, the actions taken by the Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, will not solve the problem, because ""other countries are not able to fully compensate for gas supplies"" at a level comparable to supplies from Russia."
2591	7	“Energy sanctions don't work. (…) On the contrary: energy sanctions are beneficial for Russia. (…) The explosion in the prices of raw materials such as oil and gas means that Russia earns more from energy sales than before,” said Ernst.
2591	9	"As the politician of the Left argues, ""it is immoral to maintain sanctions in this way"" because ""Russia continues to make good money from its raw materials, and our citizens and our economy suffer from a completely wrong sanctions policy."" “We should only take measures that truly end the war and do not harm our own citizens,” concludes Ernst."
2594	1	Japanese about the war in Ukraine. Just shock...

2594	5	Hiroyuki Hamada
2594	7	"I would repeat as many times as necessary. The Western establishment overthrew the Ukrainian government with the help of the Nazis in 2014 to ignite a proxy war against Russia. Most Westerners have bought into the outright lie that Russia unprovoked attacked Ukraine, when in fact Ukraine has been ruthlessly bombing the Russian-speaking population, massacring, maiming and depleting them for the past 8 years. Many of us have raised our voices on this issue only to be called ""Putin lover"", ""Russian bots"" and so on. Meanwhile, the pawns of the Western war against Russia continue to die in Ukraine. The US-backed Ukrainian government is sending untrained civilians between the ages of 18 and 60 to the front lines. Do you know what that means?"
2594	9	"I am 54 and have a son who is 18. We would die for Western imperialism if we were Ukrainians. The Ukrainian establishment murders its own officials, journalists and anyone who stands against their path of Western imperialism while continuing to slaughter Russian-speaking Eastern Ukrainians as ""separatists"". This is what ""stand with Ukraine"" means. This means subsidizing the Western defense industry, turning peacefully coexisting nations into killing each other, restructuring the economy to accommodate Western oligarchs, and selling off public wealth to these predators. People might think it's just harmless virtue signaling to prove how ""good"" you are in their communities to echo the current imperial slogan, but people actually suffer and die from it. The same was happening all over the planet. I come from Japan. I have relatives there. What happens to Ukraine can happen to any US-backed Asian country because China is the empire's original target. I feel the sadness and pain of Ukrainians, Russians and all the people who suffer from US imperial violence."
2594	11	Breaking news:
2594	13	Shinzo Abe - former Prime Minister of Japan - was shot dead in Nara, Japan. This is quite shocking, partly because this is Japan where such things are rare, and he himself is the grandson of World War II war criminal Kishi Nobusuke, who also became prime minister after the war. Their political party - the liberal Democratic Party - is known to be backed by the CIA. Shinzo Abe was known to sympathize with the Russian stance on the war in Ukraine.
2595	1	13 million people in the Horn of Africa will suffer from hunger due to global warming - News Portal STRIKE
2595	3	It will definitely be a difficult year for Africa, and forecasts for its difficulty level are becoming more and more pessimistic from month to month. According to the UN, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya will suffer the most.
2595	5	$327 million – that's how much money the UN's World Food Program (WFP) will need to meet immediate livelihood needs over the coming months and help make rural communities more resilient to the growing climate shocks. The Horn of Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia - is most vulnerable to famine.
2595	7	3 years without rain
2595	9	All three countries have not seen rain for three years, resulting in the worst drought since 1981.
2595	11	"""Crops are being destroyed, livestock are dying, famine is on the rise, all because of repeated droughts affecting the Horn of Africa,"" says WFP East Africa regional director Michael Dunford. Dunford warns that without adequate humanitarian aid, the Somali humanitarian crisis of 2011, when 250,000 people died of famine, could be repeated. And this, unfortunately, cannot be ruled out, because the average rainfall is expected to decrease instead of increasing, according to forecasts."
2595	13	The critical situation is in the south-eastern part of Ethiopia - according to UNICEF, by mid-March this year, as many as 6 million people from these areas may need humanitarian assistance. In neighboring Somalia, the number is expected to exceed 7 million.
2595	15	Africa reaps what we sow
2595	17	Despite being the continent that contributes least of all to global warming, Africa feels climate change the hardest and suffers the most serious consequences. The drought in the Horn of Africa is a prime example of this. Over the past 100 years, surface temperatures in Africa have increased by 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. According to scientists, in this century they are to exceed even these 2 degrees.
2595	19	UNICEF says that around 15,000 children have left school to help with water and other daily tasks as a result of the drought. A UNICEF representative in Ethiopia announced via videoconference at a UN briefing in Geneva that the vast majority of water sources had dried up and stressed the need to renew wells, drill new ones and supply water to health care facilities.
2595	21	No place in the world has shown so clearly how tragic the consequences of ignoring the climate catastrophe can be. For the time being, the price for galloping and uncaring capitalism has been paid the least by Africa, which is to blame for all the turmoil, but it is only a matter of time before the same problems that Africans are currently struggling with will come north.
2598	1	Colonialism is still going on. And it is one of the causes of climate change
2598	3	In the third part of the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists for the first time pointed to colonialism as the historical and current cause of the climate crisis, i.e. the greatest global threat to humanity.
2598	5	Colonialism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, but it can be seen as the conquest of territories and states accompanied by three types of violence: cultural violence through the negation of indigenous culture, economic violence through the exploitation of the population, and political violence through oppression and taking away the self-determination of the inhabitants.
2598	7	The impact of colonialism on nature is clear and can be seen through huge mines, polluted rivers and depleted lands. On every continent, colonizers cleared mangroves, grasslands, tropical forests, and wetlands to make way for quarries, plantations, ranches, roads, and railroads.
2598	9	The fact that this one specific word is included in the IPCC report may not seem like a big deal, but it is quite the opposite. Together with each report, the IPCC publishes a summary for policy makers. This summary is meticulously analyzed and discussed line by line - not only by the world's best scientists, but also by officials representing 195 governments, who influence the final wording of the summary and often comment on individual words or phrases.
2598	11	"The fact that ""colonialism"" is included in the summary means that officials and scientists around the world recognize the significant role that this phenomenon has played in ""heating"" our planet and destroying its nature. Atmos magazine noted that the role of colonialism in triggering the climate crisis has been part of the narrative of the climate justice movement for decades. For example, at last year's COP26, Brazilian indigenous activist Taily Terena opened the Indigenous Pavilion, saying that ""colonialism has caused climate change"" and the solution is ""give rights to indigenous peoples."""
2598	13	"How did ""colonialism"" come up in the IPCC report? First of all, the fact that this time more women and people of non-white skin color worked on the report, i.e. social groups particularly affected by this phenomenon, was not without influence. Second, as Atmos points out, in the eight years since the last IPCC report, there has been an explosion of literature pointing to the links between climate change and colonialism. IPCC reports, on the other hand, compile conclusions from thousands of existing works. The authors put them together and present the public with a complete picture of the scientific consensus."
2598	15	"One study showing links between colonialism and climate change was published in the journal ""PNAS"" in 2020. In it, a pair of archaeologists analyzed the climate in the Caribbean Islands and in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean. Researchers have discovered how the changes have been compounded by a history of colonization and injustice. The Caribbean is facing increasingly intense hurricanes driven by warming oceans. In addition, these threats are expected to increase with climate change caused by human activity."
2598	17	At the same time, the researchers found that colonization forced islanders to move away from methods of building resilient homes. Archaeological excavations in the Caribbean have revealed a history of circular buildings with deep-set columns made of strong local timber and light thatched roofs. However, after the colonization of the islands, European architecture displaced the traditional one. Today's homes are made of reinforced concrete rather than locally available materials, and are easily damaged by hurricanes. This reduces the chance of buildings surviving and rebuilding after intense tropical storms.
2598	19	Similarly, Madagascar's forests and other natural resources were destroyed by Europeans who wanted to make more profit from the colonies there. Today, the descendants of indigenous peoples live in poorer lands affected by soil degradation, erosion and deforestation, making these lands even more vulnerable to climate change.
2598	21	However, the relationship between colonialism and climate change is not just a relic of the past. Currently, the concept of carbon offsetting is also being analyzed as a new form of this phenomenon. That's because it allows developed countries to take advantage of developing countries by using their low carbon emissions to offset their ever-increasing carbon emissions.
2598	23	"Many companies have committed to becoming climate neutral. To achieve this goal, more and more of them reach for carbon offsets. According to strategic consulting company McKinsey, the market for voluntary carbon credits could reach as much as $50 billion by 2030. The term ""carbon offset"" refers to carbon that is being reduced, avoided or captured from the atmosphere to offset emissions produced elsewhere."
2598	25	Most carbon offset projects involve reforestation. Cutting carbon emissions by planting more trees in developing countries may seem like a good idea. However, through initiatives to slow the pace of climate change, richer countries dominate less poorer ones and their inhabitants, creating a new form of neo-colonialism - climate colonialism. Rich countries invest in countries of the global South and dictate how to maintain land and forests to people who have lived there for thousands of years. When a new normal that those in power want indigenous peoples to adopt conflicts with how indigenous groups typically deal with their own land, this can potentially lead to displacement and even violence.
2598	27	In 2014, the Oakland Institute revealed that the Kenya Forest Service, funded by the World Bank, had beaten, threatened and even arrested members of the Sengwer community to obtain land for forestry for CO2 compensation. At a 2016 United Nations meeting, an indigenous leader from Turtle Island accused developed countries of privatizing and selling sacred forests and land that they owned. Carbon offset projects harm the population, also changing the economic system on which its survival depends.
2598	29	Most of the carbon offset projects are located in the countries of the Global South, and most are bought by the countries of the Global North. So instead of holding governments accountable and changing existing patterns of production and consumption, actors in developed countries are using carbon offsets as a form of indulgence. They force the countries of the Global South to change their economies so that the countries of the Global North can continue to emit CO2.
2598	31	So how to eliminate the phenomenon of climate colonialism? First, by giving indigenous peoples co-determination in climate investments concerning their lands and landscape transformation, and also simply by returning their lands. It is also important to fund long-term Indigenous land management programs and give Indigenous people autonomy in spending decisions, as well as leveraging the ecological expertise of local communities.
2599	1	"Korwin-Mikke: ""ice is growing in Antarctica"". The thesis cannot be defended"
2599	3	"Janusz Korwin-Mikke, MP of the Confederation, argued on August 6 on Polish Radio 24 that what is said about the need to close coal-fired power plants or promote more ecological energy sources is ""nonsense"" and humanity has ""gone crazy"". ""These environmentalists are crazy too,"" the Confederate politician was indignant. Korwin-Mikke talked about the natural cycle of carbon circulation in the environment and argued that this element ""was in the air, somehow the earth survived it"". ""So if it goes back into the air again, what will happen?"" It's warming up, and that's fine. They're threatening to raise the temperature two degrees, and that's great. It will be in Poland just like in Czech Prague, so nothing will be so terrible – he perorated."
2599	5	"Korwin-Mikke went on to talk about the ""previous global warming"", which he claimed happened around the 11th century, when Greenland was ""a green land, as the name suggests"". He also talked about the ""peak of global cooling"" and about the ""local, global cooling"" around 1600. - There is no sign that the water level has risen in any special way - continued Korwin-Mikke. He added that he had already read 30 years ago that in 20 years the Maldives would be under water. ""Meanwhile, property prices in the Maldives are going up,"" he said."
2599	7	Ecologists don't say one thing...
2599	9	"The most significant part of Janusz Korwin-Mikke's argument was the thesis about Antarctica, where the ice cover is supposedly growing. The politician explained that the reason for the increase in ice is the movement of water vapor over this continent. ""The environmentalists don't say one thing: indeed, ice turns to water, that's true, but water turns to steam,"" he explained. - For example, in Florida, everyone can find that it's muggy, right? Then steam is formed, this steam, by the way, condenses in the province of Saint Catherine in Brazil. In Brazil, they have snow that hasn't been seen for 200 years, and it's a lot of snow, and then this couple flies over Antarctica and, to the amazement of environmentalists, ice builds up in Antarctica. This is the steam above Greenland, it melts, evaporates and travels south - said Korwin-Mikke."
2599	11	The recording of Janusz Korwin-Mikke's speech was shown to Dr. Jakub Małecki, a glaciologist-hydrologist who studies glaciers. He is associated with the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. The expert decided that it is impossible to defend the statement that the ice in Antarctica is growing. There is less and less of it, and this is due to human activity over the last hundred years.
2599	13	"Prague in Warsaw? ""A man will ricochet"""
2599	15	"Doctor Jakub Małecki explains that climate changes have occurred many times in the history of the Earth, which was influenced by the activity of the Sun, orbital cycles of the Earth and changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases. - We are especially interested in the recent changes today, because we are experiencing them at a very fast pace - says Dr. Małecki. When about 12,000 years ago, the last glaciation ended, it took nature about 1,500 years to raise the average global temperature by 1 degree Celsius. ""We and our CO2 emissions did it ten times faster,"" he notes."
2599	17	He goes on to explain that nature emits as much greenhouse gas as it can absorb. Now it is impossible - the combined CO2 emission of nature and people is slightly higher than the total absorption. The surplus of CO2 accumulates every year, and the disproportion between natural and actual concentrations is growing.
2599	19	"Will - as Janusz Korwin-Mikke claims - in Poland it will be like in Prague and ""nothing will be so terrible""? Dr. Małecki replies that in the case of Poland, global warming of 2 degrees may mean a 3-degree increase in temperature or even more. - Such warming means huge and unfavorable changes for nature, including plants, fauna and hydrology of the country. It's not cool, because the ricochet will always hit a person - he says. He notes that the increase in temperature of one degree Celsius over the last little more than 100 years is an average value for the entire globe, including the oceans that cover most of it. And the land is warming up faster than the oceans."
2599	21	Ice in Antarctica is being lost by underwater melting, not by warm air
2599	23	Doctor Jakub Małecki says that greater warming is clearly visible in the polar regions - some have already warmed by several degrees Celsius. In the Arctic, located around the North Pole, the ice floe floating on the sea is disappearing, mountain glaciers are disappearing, the Greenland ice sheet is melting faster and faster.
2599	25	Contrary to what Janusz Korwin-Mikke suggests, the name of Greenland (literally - green land) was given to the island's discoverer and outlaw Eryk Rudy, who wanted to encourage settlers from Iceland to colonize it. - In the times after the birth of Christ, it was never green, i.e. with a clearly smaller range of ice than today - notes Dr. Małecki. There was no global warming around the 11th century, and no global cooling until 1650. Temperature changes were noted at most locally or regionally. - Research shows that the global climate cooled down extremely slowly but systematically from about 5000 BC until the 19th century, when human activity seriously entered the climatic game - says Dr. Małecki.
2599	27	As he explains, the ice situation around the south pole is more complex than in the north. A clear distinction needs to be made between sea ice (ice floes) floating in the Southern Ocean and land ice on the Antarctic continent. Today, the floe covers a slightly larger area than in the 1980s. Stronger winds push it further and further away from the coast. - The ice sheet generally systematically loses mass and the overall rate is increasing - emphasizes Dr. Małecki.
2599	29	"The ice sheet is divided into two main parts: a larger eastern one and a smaller western one. - The eastern part is doing well: most studies for the last two to three decades find either a relatively stable mass, even with periods of growth, or only relatively small losses - explains the expert. ""It's worse with the western part, which loses mass quickly,"" he adds."
2599	31	This is to a lesser extent due to more intense surface melting, and primarily due to underwater melting and the breaking off of icebergs into the ocean. For Antarctica, therefore, the greatest threat is not the warming air, but the rising temperature of the water surrounding it. - So it is impossible to defend the statement that the ice in Antarctica is increasing. Overall, it loses it, even though the temperature inside the continent never rises above zero, concludes Dr. Jakub Małecki.
2599	33	Increased water evaporation? Glaciers lose mass anyway
2599	35	In an analysis for Konkret24, Dr. Małecki emphasizes that he is not aware of any scientific sources that in the 1990s would alert against the flooding of the Maldives around 2010. - This risk is real for 2100, because it is the flattest and lowest-lying country in the world - evaluates Dr. Małecki. He adds that these islands may become uninhabitable due to the potentially much greater extent of storm surges or flooding than in the past.
2599	37	"Mountain glaciers around the world and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica melt, pour their meltwater from the land into the ocean and raise its level. - Ice is the largest contributor to this process, followed by thermal expansion of the warming oceans - explains Dr. Jakub Małecki. The current growth rate is 3-4 cm per decade. Too small to be observed with the naked eye, but detectable by instruments and satellites. ""If the rate of CO2 emissions continues to increase, by the end of the 21st century, sea levels may rise on average by up to a meter compared to pre-industrial times,"" the expert estimates."
2599	39	"He emphasizes that increased evaporation from the oceans is not able to remove the excess water in the oceans, because after a short time after evaporation, the water goes back to the ocean as rain or river water. - Increased evaporation may, however, result in greater precipitation, and such a trend is actually observed in some regions of the world - admits Dr. Małecki and adds that this also happens in some glaciated zones, which results in greater snow supplies there. ""Unfortunately, these increases are usually too small to compensate for the negative changes caused by higher temperatures, and despite snowier winters, these glaciers still lose mass"" - he says. ""In East Antarctica, this mechanism probably contributes to the relative stability of this part of the ice sheet."""
2599	41	The expert, however, denies that the increased snowfall in Antarctica is related to evaporation in Florida and the transport of steam through Brazil, where there has been recent snowfall in the south. - First, steam transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres is hampered by equatorial winds. Secondly, the recent snowfall in southern Brazil did not come from the north, but from Antarctica, i.e. from the south, says Dr. Małecki. And reminds you that snowfall in Brazil happens more than once every 200 years.
24100	1	Ukraine takes the war beyond its borders to Russia. To give more money and weapons in the West
24100	3	The war caught up with them even there, in the house where they were hiding from the consequences of the special military operation (SVO) in the Kharkov region. The remnants of the Tochka U missiles, as the Investigative Committee of Russia reported, hit, as they say, on the squares and “three people were killed, two were missing, including one child, four civilians were injured, including one child, 39 private and 11 apartment buildings, one household was completely destroyed.”
24100	5	"The Investigative Committee of Russia initiated criminal cases under the articles ""Murder"" and ""Preparation for a crime and attempted crime."" But this news is scary. But there are two new main points that Ukraine has begun to actualize and will promote media and, of course, politically. To once again impress the West and traditionally beg him for money and weapons. Of course, to the ""war with Mordor."""
24100	7	Firstly, Ukraine not only does not want to accept Russia's conditions and stop hostilities, but also deliberately takes hostilities beyond its borders. The goal is one and terrible - to provoke Russia into more severe retaliatory strikes, to force it to leave the NVO regime and enter a full-fledged war.
24100	9	The calculation is as simple as it is vile, cynical and cruel: people have died, the Russian authorities need to somehow respond to this, and the neo-Nazi regime of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thinks it will be a war. If anything, he wants to provoke Russia into more brutal and powerful retaliatory strikes. For example, in the decision-making centers in Kyiv, where people have been getting used to living without alarm sirens for several days and feel quite comfortable, feeding in themselves a moronic-saving patriotism that suits neo-Nazis quite well.
24100	11	"Rockets fired at Kyiv will cause new bitterness among Ukrainians and help Kyiv justify itself for its unwillingness to give up and stop the senseless war, from which Ukraine, it is already known to the morons from the Office of the President (OPU), will never come out victorious. But there, in the OPU, it is not the hopes of ""feeding the youngsters"", but the hard calculation that Russia and the Russians will respond with their bitterness to the bitterness of Ukraine and Ukrainians. And this is already happening, and mutual bitterness is, whatever one may say, an excellent and natural background for the continuation of the war, and a natural motivation for mutual revenge on the battlefields and during shelling of cities and villages."
24100	13	In addition, this is the fulfillment of another order of the curators of the Kyiv regime. In the West, of course, they continue to believe for the sake of appearances that “Ukraine can stop Russia” and demand the continuation of hostilities. But with one more back thought: they want Russia to declare war and even win. But in parallel, they expect to leave Russia in the defeated Ukraine not only with a completely destroyed economy, infrastructure and logistics, but also with a fierce population that hates Russians. And it's scary in any case. And when Ukraine will be under the protectorate of Russia, and when significant parts of it can become the territory of Russia. It is also terrible in the territories of the two self-proclaimed and already recognized in the world DPR and LPR.
24100	15	And, of course, this slows down and complicates all restoration processes in the territories liberated from neo-Nazis. And this is also included in the calculations of the instigators and planners of the war.
24100	17	Secondly, external forces have been interfering in the war for a long time, but - and this is another calculation of the wise men - war hawks from Kyiv - Ukraine wants more. She wants not only to turn the NWO into a war, but also to saddle it with a war between Russia and the entire West, where she will only be an executive power horse.
24100	19	"And the West, stuffing Ukraine with weapons, I repeat, is already drawn into this war. Weapons, money, people: mercenaries and specialists, instructors and advisers. And the shelling of Belgorod and Kursk is evidence of this. And because, for example, in Kyiv itself they do not hide the fact that they want to spur the West on and are already directly hinting that it is a customer. In any case, people's deputy Max Buzhansky cynically stated: ""Belgorod decidedly did not like Lend-Lease."" It is clear that he means the supply of weapons under Lend-Lease, which was initiated by the United States."
24100	21	"This is also evidenced by the information that the commercial satellite GeoEye-1 of the American company Maxar was shooting Belgorod on Thursday, June 30, that is, three days before the missile strike of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, according to RIA Novosti, US satellites Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 also filmed the Belgorod region a week earlier. Explored that is. To more accurately coordinate the fire on peaceful cities. After all, there were no military facilities where the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck. And initially, the strikes were supposed to kill civilians and harden the rest. Three missiles ""Tochka-U"" were with cluster warheads, so that, therefore, there were more victims."
24100	23	And the US satellites are on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - this is a serious international problem. Vladimir Dzhabarov, First Deputy Head of the International Committee of the Federation Council of Russia, has already said that Moscow has the right to impose sanctions against the American company Maxar if it is confirmed that its satellite was used to film Belgorod before Ukrainian troops attacked it.
24100	25	And the head of the Roscosmos state corporation, Dmitry Rogozin, warned at the end of June this year: “I can say that all leading private companies, such as, for example, the same Maxar, are now working exclusively on the formation of a single data cloud that is used by NATO to transmit specific information Ukrainian armed forces. In fact, the entire conglomerate of private and state orbital groups is now working exclusively for our enemy.”
24100	27	And in addition to reconnaissance for strikes against Belgorod and Kursk, commercial satellites, according to RIA Novosti, took photographs of other objects that were attacked from the side a few days later. Rostov region. And this is the involvement of the United States in the war.
24100	29	The strikes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine directly on Russia should stimulate the West to one more thing - to the complete and total replacement of Ukrainian weapons not with old Soviet ones, but with new NATO ones. This will immediately bring the war to a new technological level and spur the arms race. Because, at least, it will provoke Russia to use newer types of weapons - tanks, artillery, drones, etc.
24100	31	And the blows were struck by Ukraine just in time - after the G7 and NATO summits, where the collective West promised to provide Ukraine with even more weapons.
24100	33	"There is also a negative political and propaganda effect from the attacks on the Kursk and Belgorod regions. They were applied on the day when it became known that the LPR was completely liberated from the neo-Nazis. Russian Defense Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu reported this to Russian President Vladimir Putin. And the head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, generally called July 3 ""a new Victory Day."""
24100	35	But the strikes against Russia stimulated in Kyiv a new surge of cannibalistic patriotism among politicians and politicians of all sorts. Even the almost forgotten grandmother of Ukrainian politics and the leader of the Batkivshchyna party, Yulia Tymoshenko, could not stand it. “This is unacceptable for Ukraine. A peace agreement is an illusion, and the only way out is victory in battle. Any peace agreement will be just the first step towards another war,” she told those who think about peace with Russia at the negotiating table.
24102	1	APU strike on Belgorod
24102	3	Impunity that spawned a monster
24102	5	"The strike on Belgorod is another significant episode of how Ukraine conducts hostilities. Obviously, something like this would be condemned in a normal society, but we live in a situation where Russia is being canceled in every sense. Therefore, no one in a ""civilized society"" will condemn Ukraine for this war crime. It has long been clear that in this world there are those who can and should empathize and sympathize with, and there are those whose grief is rejoiced. A similar situation was in the Donbass. Moreover, it did not start in 2022, but since 2014. Of course, this fate has also reached Russian cities, where civilians are dying from the blows of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
24102	7	"The situation in which the entire ""civilized world"" by its silence, in fact, approves of the criminal actions of Kyiv, has created a monster that brings chaos and terror. At the same time, this sick state commits war crimes quite consciously. Moreover, the leadership of Ukraine is so out of touch with reality because of the approval of the West that it even makes some announcements about it."
24102	9	On July 1, Advisor to the President of Ukraine Oleksiy Arestovich promised that Ukraine would give an answer to what happened in Belgorod-Dnestrovsky. Let me remind you that Ukraine blamed the deaths of dozens of civilians on the Russian side, which allegedly delivered a deliberate strike on civilian infrastructure. This is an absolutely uncharacteristic situation for Russia, as even the Americans are talking about. I will quote ex-US Senator Dick Black, who actually admitted that Russia behaves extremely carefully in relation to the Ukrainian population and does not fight with the civilian population. But the Americans behave completely differently with the local population in countries where they participate in hostilities.
24102	11	“There is a well-known photograph of a Russian tank that was stopped by a group of about 40 civilians in Ukraine. They just went out onto the road, blocking it, and as a result, the tank stopped. As a former military man, I can tell you that if a crowd of people got in the way of an American tank in Vietnam, this tank would not slow down for a second! He wouldn't honk, he wouldn't do anything, not even fire a warning shot. He would just move on. And I think it's more typical of war. I am not criticizing Americans. I was there and I fought, and probably I would have driven straight on the tank, because this is a war,” the American politician said in an interview.
24102	13	It turns out that even high-ranking Americans do not believe in the version of the Ukrainian side, especially since the details of the strike on Belgorod-Dnestrovsky have not become public, except for what Kyiv has voiced. But Ukraine fulfilled its threat. Belgorod was shelled, as a result of which civilians were killed, including three refugees from Kharkov. Ukraine killed its own citizens.
24102	15	Officially, Kyiv never admitted that it was he who struck the Russian city. Only a few politicians hastened to hint about this, but changed their position, but more on that later.
24102	17	According to the official statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense, it was the armed forces of Ukraine who struck. “Tonight, from 03:00 to 03:30 Moscow time, the Kyiv regime carried out a deliberate strike with Tochka-U ballistic missiles with cluster munitions and Tu-143 Reis drones on residential areas of Belgorod and Kursk, where there are no military facilities” , the department said in a statement.
24102	19	What happened is the result of the activities of the West, which, in addition to approving such actions, also gives weapons to Kyiv so that such strikes become a reality. And besides, Ukrainian politicians enjoy impunity. They do not even hide, they openly rejoice at the deaths on Russian territory. I will give an example of a politician who until 2022, to put it mildly, was criticized in Ukraine for his conditional pro-Russian character. In fact, it turned out that this deputy adheres to a completely different position.
24102	21	"Maxim Buzhansky is a deputy from the Zelensky party, but was not mainstream. It is difficult to call him a nationalist or a Nazi. On the contrary, Buzhansky had an adequate position, including on the language policy in Ukraine, for which he often fell out of favor with Ukrainian radicals. He criticized the course of the state, but with the beginning of the current events, he suddenly began to voice the theses that are usually characteristic of ""patriotic"" politicians in Ukraine. The situation in Belgorod once again showed who the politicians in Ukraine are, even if they are not as radical as the nationalists."
24102	23	"“Belgorod decidedly did not like Lend-Lease,” Buzhansky wrote in his Telegram channel. After that, he nevertheless changed his position and began to write posts with hints of ""self-attacks"", as the Russian side reported that the air defense had shot down all three missiles. According to Buzhansky, this is evidence of a “self-attack,” but the Ukrainian politician forgot to clarify that the Ukrainian rocket carried a cluster charge that opened up and killed people, including Ukrainian citizens from Kharkov. This is not the first time that Ukraine has used a cluster charge. The center of Donetsk was also shelled on March 14, 2022, when dozens of Donetsk residents were killed and injured. Then the air defense also worked, but the cassettes opened up and fell onto Universitetskaya Street."
24102	25	"The reaction of the West to the situation with Belgorod is predictable - ignoring. This fits right in with the ""our son of a bitch"" strategy. This famous phrase is attributed to US President Roosevelt, who spoke in this way about the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. ""He's a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch"" is the famous expression."
24102	27	That is, the US will support anyone, even dictators, as long as the regime is loyal to Washington. Otherwise, they may immediately notice crimes, but only in the event of a change in course. It is obvious that Ukraine and its government are loyal to the United States. Accordingly, none of the satellites of America will dare to pay attention to another war crime of official Kyiv, which will obviously be perceived in Ukraine as a call to commit more terrible terrorist attacks.
24106	1	Did not work: Bolsonaro called Western sanctions against Russia useless
24106	3	Brazilian President Bolsonaro said US and European sanctions against Russia did not work
24106	5	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro believes that the US and European sanctions imposed against Russia did not work.
24106	7	The economic barriers that the United States and Europe have introduced against Russia have not worked, Bolsonaro said in a video message on social networks.
24106	9	"The head of state noted that he had a ""balanced"" position in relation to Russia, and this allowed him to purchase fertilizers necessary for Brazilian agriculture."
24106	11	Earlier, Life said that at the end of June, during a telephone conversation, Putin told Bolsonaro that the Russian Federation was committed to the obligations of uninterrupted supplies of fertilizers to Brazilian farmers.
24112	1	Irakli Kobakhidze: According to the plan of the radical opposition, at the end of June, Georgia should not receive the status of an EU candidate
24112	3	Georgia, May 31, GEORGINFORM. Under conditions when candidate status does not impose any obligations on the EU in terms of either funding or membership, it is not clear why he should deny this status to the state of Georgia and the Georgian people, when our country and government differ in terms of fulfilling obligations related to introduction, - Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the Georgian Dream, said at a briefing.
24112	5	"As Kobakhidze noted, the government gives the society a promise that ""this scenario of the organizers and participants of the Bakurian meeting, the new Shulaveri committee, the party of war and betrayal in Georgia cannot be realized."""
24112	7	"“As you know, the radical opposition continues to publicly say that Georgia does not deserve the status of an EU candidate. As you know, they talk with the same message with their foreign colleagues. Their goal and calculation is simple: by the end of June, according to their calculation, Georgia, unlike Ukraine and Moldova, should not receive the status of a candidate member of the EU, which, according to their plan, will be followed by public unrest, a coup of power by the ""National Movement"" and its satellites, and drawing Georgia into the war. Everyone is well aware that the EU has no reason to deny Georgia a candidacy, especially if it grants candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. Recall that it was under our rule that Georgia achieved all the tangible results in terms of integration into the EU. It was under the rule of the Georgian Dream that we signed an association agreement and a free trade agreement with the European Union and received a visa-free regime. Georgia is ahead of both applicant countries in all relevant parameters, which no one can deny. In particular, Georgia has already fulfilled 45 percent of its obligations under the Association Agreement, which is an unprecedented result. According to these data, Georgia is ahead of not only Ukraine and Moldova, but also some countries that already have candidate status. In addition, by granting candidate status, the EU does not spend any more euros on Georgia. As you know, the status of a candidate does not oblige the EU to allocate any additional funding to Georgia,” Kobakhidze said."
24112	9	In addition, according to him, the EU does not assume any obligation to join the country within any certain period of time after granting candidate membership status.
24116	1	And the covid seems to be Ukrainian: a sensational investigation of the British
24116	3	Three months before the world learned about COVID-19, the US Department of Defense paid contracts for its “research” as the British conservative publication The Exposé found out.
24116	5	Remember: On February 11, 2020, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the new coronavirus that had spread from China had been given the official name COVID-19. By this day, it was already known about the doctor from the admissions department of Wuhan Central Hospital Ai Feng, to whom a 65-year-old man with an unusual respiratory infection was brought on December 18, 2019. Before his illness, the man worked at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market. This was the first patient with an unusual respiratory infection whom she examined, did tests and found the same coronavirus. It was her discovery that the ophthalmologist of the same hospital, Li Wenliang, tried to make public. He reported the novel virus outbreak on WeChat on December 31, 2019, the Huanan Market was closed the next day, and Li Wenliang developed symptoms of the virus infection on January 10. He died on February 6 in the morning ... But, I repeat, only on February 11 the world learned the name of a new disease - COVID-19.
24116	7	Why is it so important? Yes, because, we repeat, three months before the end of the year, the US Department of Defense paid for the COVID-19 Research contract (COVID-19 Research) ... in Ukraine.
24116	9	The revealed details of the contract are very eloquent, and if they are true, then there is no escape from questions.
24116	11	"According to US government documents, on November 12, 2019, the Pentagon paid for a contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC “COVID-19 Research”, which was carried out in Ukraine and was actually part of a much larger contract with Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp “Biothreat Reduction Program in Ukraine""."
24116	13	And this was 5 weeks before a 65-year-old man who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market was brought to Ai Feng's emergency room? And 3 months before the world found out, what is the name of the terrible attack that came from China? It is easy to imagine that this is only possible if Labyrinth Global Health INC already knew about the existence of Corona Virus Disease- 2019, that is, about the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV coronavirus ...
24116	15	The contract with Labyrinth Global Health INC did not exist only on paper. A peek into the official public source of information on United States government federal spending, The Exposé suggests: According to the website, as of April 12, 2021, the US government has spent $3.63 trillion on COVID-19. But we are most interested in the expenses for the activities of Labyrinth Global Health INC, addressed to Kyiv. And we can easily find them.
24116	17	"Laboratory equipment for Kyiv, office furniture for Kyiv are quite harmless. But the $369,500 of Labyrinth Global Health INC for ""SME Manuscript Documentation and COVID-19 Research"" paid out on November 12, 2019, three months before Covid-19 was officially named, isn't that shocking? And wasn’t the information that the United States set up three dozen biolaboratories in Ukraine that conducted experiments, including on Ukrainians, caused us less shock?"
24116	19	In 14 of them, Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp acted as a contractor: in Kyiv, Odessa, Vinnitsa, Uzhgorod, Dnipro, Lvov, Ternopil, Kharkov, Kherson ... Only the Kherson Diagnostic Laboratory, built in December 2012, cost the US Department of Defense 1,728,822 dollars - spent solely in the interests of ordinary Ukrainians, of course.
24116	21	And, perhaps, the most interesting. The remuneration of Labyrinth Global Health INC was paid based on the results of its activities in Ukraine under a contract that began to operate on September 20, 2012 (!) of the year, it cost $ 21.7 million and was executed on October 13, 2020. What the specialists of the American Biological Threat Reduction Program in Ukraine have managed to do over the years, we will no longer know. Even despite the fact that under the pressure of information about the work of US biolaboratories in Ukraine, provided by the Russian military department, the Americans began to carefully study it. At the same time, Washington analysts are surprised and shrug: “What kind of strains were studied in Washington-funded laboratories? What threat did such work pose to the civilian population? They are surprised, although the United States has retained in its legislation the norms allowing for work in the field of biological weapons, despite the convention on the prohibition of such weapons, signed by 165 states of the world, including ratified by the United States.
24116	23	Agree, if the US government funded research on COVID-19 before it became known about its existence, then this means that they either knew about its existence for a long time, but were silent, or participated in the creation of this virus in the laboratory.
24116	25	The British The Exposé suggests taking into account the fact that the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the American biotechnology company Moderna, which develops medicines based on messenger RNA, had a “candidate” for a coronavirus vaccine in December 2019. This follows from a confidential agreement, which states that Moderna, along with NIAID, agreed to transfer their jointly developed mRNA Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
24116	27	Maybe that's why since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, at least nine people have become dollar billionaires due to the growth in the profits of pharmaceutical companies that produce COVID-19 vaccines? And the first in this nine is the CEO of the American company Moderna Stephane Bancel, who made a fortune of $ 4.3 billion.
24117	1	German economist Hueter: the gas market will collapse if the EU countries think only of themselves
24117	3	Michael Hüter, head of the Institute for German Economics, said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if individual EU states decide to cut off gas supplies to neighboring countries due to a possible shutdown of its supplies from Russia, the European gas market could collapse.
24117	5	“There should not be a situation where individual countries stop their supplies to neighboring ones. This is in the interests of Europe and in the interests of Germany, which exchanges gas with all neighboring countries,” he said.
24117	7	In addition, the expert said that it was necessary to avoid a situation similar to the one that happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when European countries closed their borders, which put European supply chains in jeopardy.
24117	9	“Immediately after the start of the pandemic, some EU states closed their borders, which greatly affected the transportation of goods and supplies to the European Union. This should not happen again,” says Hüter.
24117	11	The economist is sure that the selfishness of the EU countries can lead to catastrophic consequences.
24117	13	“If the EU thinks only of itself, cutting off gas flows to neighboring countries, the collapse of the European gas market threatens to have devastating consequences for companies and consumers. A stoppage of production in the industry is then almost inevitable,” summed up Hüter.
24117	15	Earlier, German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck urged companies that have office space to reduce the air temperature in offices against the backdrop of the energy crisis.
24118	1	"""What happened to Khashoggi is outrageous."" What Biden talked about with the Saudi prince"
24118	3	The head of the White House spoke about this on Sunday, July 17, upon his return from the Middle East tour, TASS reports.
24118	5	On Friday, Biden said that at the meeting he told the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia that he considered him responsible for the murder in 2018 of Khashoggi, who collaborated with the American newspaper The Washington Post.
24118	7	Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir later said he had not heard such a conversation. His words were quoted by a Fox News journalist. The US President was asked to clarify whether these statements of the Saudi minister are true.
24118	9	“No,” the American leader replied.
24118	11	"Biden was also asked if he regrets that he and Mohammed bin Salman greeted each other with the traditional fist-to-fist greeting that has become traditional amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""Why don't you guys talk about what matters? I am happy to answer questions that matter,” he told reporters."
24118	13	The American leader also expressed hope that inflation in the US will start to decline. According to him, in the near future it will become clear whether such a trend is planned.
24118	15	Conversation in Jeddah
24118	17	The fact that Biden, during a conversation with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, allegedly did not claim that he was guilty of the murder of Khashoggi, was reported on Saturday by Fox News journalist Jacqui Heinrich, citing the Kingdom's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.
24118	19	"""Adel al-Jubeir stated in no uncertain terms that he 'didn't hear' Biden telling Mohammed bin Salman that he believed he was responsible for the killing of Khashoggi,"" a correspondent from the White House pool tweeted."
24118	21	Negotiations with the leadership of Saudi Arabia, which were attended by the crown prince, the US president held in Jeddah. “We discussed human rights and the need for political reform. As always, I made it clear that this topic is extremely important for me and for the United States, ”Biden said after the meeting.
24118	23	“As for the Khashoggi murder, I raised this issue at the very beginning of the meeting, making it clear that I thought about it then and what I think now,” he added.
24118	25	One of the reporters asked how Mohammed bin Salman reacted to his words. “He essentially said he was not personally responsible for this,” Biden replied.
24118	27	The US president later said that he did not regret his earlier threats to turn Saudi Arabia into a rogue state in connection with the murder of Khashoggi. “I don’t regret anything I said,” he pointed out, stressing that “what happened to Khashoggi is outrageous.”
24118	29	Murder of a journalist
24118	31	Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the future king of Saudi Arabia, was considered by the US National Intelligence to be the main culprit in the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, known for critical articles about the politics of Riyadh.
24118	33	A journalist who has lived in the United States since 2017 and worked for The Washington Post was killed at the Saudi Arabian Consulate General in Istanbul as a result of the conflict.
24118	35	"In February 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the United States published a report on the assassination of Khashoggi, and, according to the American side, the Saudi crown prince allegedly personally approved the operation, because he saw the journalist as a threat. Then the US administration announced the introduction of visa restrictions for 76 citizens of the kingdom. Biden, as a candidate for the presidency, promised to turn Saudi Arabia into a ""rogue state."" In Riyadh, Washington's conclusions were categorically rejected."
24124	1	In Crimea, they said that the reunification of the south of Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion
24124	3	Adviser to the head of the Crimea Kryuchkov said that the reunification of the south of Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion
24124	5	The reunification of the liberated regions of southern Ukraine with Russia is a foregone conclusion, attempts by the Kyiv authorities to prevent this are doomed to failure, Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea on information policy, told RIA Novosti.
24124	7	"Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, in an interview with the British newspaper The Times, said that Zelensky had ordered the military to liberate the southern territory of the country. For this purpose, ""millions of fighting forces equipped with Western weapons"" are being assembled."
24124	9	The Kyiv regime began a policy of terror, blockades and stuffing against the civilian population of the liberated territories. The official speakers of Kyiv are frightening with a counteroffensive and urging everyone to leave, as they realize that a referendum in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions is inevitable and will be held without fail. The reunification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is a foregone conclusion, and attempts by the Kyiv regime to prevent this are doomed to failure, Kryuchkov told RIA Novosti.
24124	11	According to him, the liberated regions, following the example of Crimea, will become full-fledged subjects of the Russian Federation.
24124	13	During the special operation, the Russian military took control of the Kherson region and the Azov part of the Zaporozhye region in southern Ukraine. Civil-military administrations were formed in the regions, the ruble was put into circulation, and Russian TV channels and radio stations began broadcasting. The regions announced plans to become subjects of the Russian Federation.
24126	1	In the Crimea estimated the likelihood of reunification of the south of Ukraine and Russia
24126	3	Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea on information policy, commented on the likelihood of reunification of the liberated regions of southern Ukraine and Russia. His words are quoted by RIA Novosti.
24126	5	Kryuchkov assessed the possibility of reunification of the Ukrainian regions with the Russian ones and said that this decision was a foregone conclusion. Therefore, the desire of Kyiv to prevent this procedure is doomed to failure, the politician is sure.
24126	7	“The Kyiv regime began a policy of terror, blockades and stuffing against the civilian population of the liberated territories. The official speakers of Kyiv are frightening with a counteroffensive and urging everyone to leave, as they realize that a referendum in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions is inevitable and will be held without fail. The reunification of these historically Russian lands with Russia is a foregone conclusion, and the attempts of the Kyiv regime to prevent this are doomed to failure,” he stressed.
24126	9	The adviser added that the liberated regions will use the experience of Crimea and will become part of Russia as full-fledged subjects
24126	11	“Crimea was, is and will be Russian. Forever. Zaporozhye and Kherson are already waiting in a large and friendly Russian family, ”concluded Kryuchkov.
24126	13	Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said that President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered the recapture of the south of the country. The corresponding task was given to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU). “We understand that politically this is extremely necessary for our country,” Reznikov stressed.
24127	1	We are left with a painful procedure - to sprinkle the wound with salt or treat it with iodine
24127	3	"Successful coup d'état in Georgia has been carried out twice in its modern history. First, in 1991-92, the power of Zviad Gamsakhurdia was curtailed by force of arms, and in 2003, as a result of the ""color revolution"", Eduard Shevardnadze was forced to resign."
24127	5	"Zviad Gamsakhurdia, expelled from his homeland, assessed the first coup as follows: ""The coup d'état in Georgia took place with the approval of US President Bush and with the direct participation of Secretary of State Baker."" No one has yet appreciated the second coup - Shevardnadze went to the grave, publicly saying nothing bad against the Americans (otherwise who knew better than him where, in which state, in which country coup d'etat, ""color revolutions"" were conceived and planned) , contract political assassinations, terrorist acts and thousands of other nasty things and misfortunes)."
24127	7	"And just a few days ago, former national security adviser to President Trump, John Bolton, suddenly made a sensational confession, talking about how the United States planned and carried out “color revolutions” in this or that country. The recognition was followed by a noisy reaction in the world. ""Coup d'etat is a weapon that the US has been using for decades,"" China's Global Times wrote. The article also said: ""The United States is reaping the bitter fruits of the so-called democracy that the White House has been spreading abroad."" The position of the political elite of the United States is assessed as selfish, and the author calls the statements of John Bolton shameless. Dmitry Polyansky, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, believes that “these revelations of Bolton are an admission of a gross violation of the UN Charter, which the world has no right to put up with. Bolton's words should serve as the basis for an international investigation."""
24127	9	"Despite such a sharp reaction, Bolton did not, as they say, back up. His position is: ""Many do not understand what needs to be done to protect the United States."" According to the former adviser, ""it does not matter what other states think on this issue."" It turns out that in the United States to this day they are guided by the not-so-democratic principle of Machiavelli, according to which ""The end justifies the means."" I suppose, after all this, it is superfluous to ask - who is planning the next coup d'état in Georgia? And, by the way, the answer to this main question was not given now, but a very long time ago, although some ambiguities remain: “Why is it now? Or – what do they dislike so much about the actions and decisions of the current Georgian authorities?”"
24127	11	Let's try to approach this problem from the other end. That is, let's start from the opposite: maybe no coup d'état is planned in Georgia? It is clear that no one can directly answer this question for you. The initiators will not admit: yes, we are planning a coup d'état in Georgia. However, it is worth taking a closer look and listening to the statements, actions, moods, positions, soberly following the logic of events, as all this, whether we like it or not, will itself lead us to an unmistakable conclusion - someone somewhere has long been thinking about organizing in Georgia coup d'état. It suffices to recall a few general trends that have recently developed political events in our country, and they themselves will serve as a crying fact that Georgia is being driven into a dead end with all its might:
24127	13	1. Sending Saakashvili to Georgia, moreover, precisely at the time when a large-scale anti-Russian provocation in Ukraine was planned in full swing (documents confirming that the West planned a dirty anti-Russian provocation are now in the hands of Russia);
24127	15	2. Demonstrative refusal of the European Union to grant candidate status to Georgia;
24127	17	3. An attempt to raise mass protests against the current Georgian leadership under the motive of refusing to give the country a candidate status, demands for the resignation of the government and the creation of a so-called technical government;
24127	19	"4. The campaign launched by the opposition to open a ""second front"" in Georgia against Russia;"
24127	21	5. Direct or indirect involvement in these processes of embassies and ambassadors operating in Georgia.
24127	23	This list of events clearly shows that the “fifth column” existing inside Georgia is acting in concert with outside forces. Why, one wonders, did the European Union not begin to grant us the status of a candidate country, if it considered worthy of its being in a state of war, mired in fascist ideology, large-scale corruption and a thousand other obvious vices, Ukraine, if it was not stingy with it for being in no better position than us? , the position of Moldova? What would the EU lose or what responsibility would the European Union assume by throwing us just one word (candidate)? It does not imply absolutely no obligations for the European Union, but why then are they stingy to present us with this empty teaser that says nothing and gives nothing? The answer is unambiguous: in this way (taunting the Georgian people with a forbidden fruit) they tried to provoke a revolutionary situation in Georgia, which, of course, was immediately picked up by the sabotage groups of the West operating within us, who launched an attack on the Georgian authorities, through which, as stated, Georgia, you see Li, lost her chance for candidate status.
24127	25	Such is the provocation, as if played by notes! To which organically joined the sabotage activities of the American and European embassies, which further exacerbated the situation. Just look at what nasty statements US Ambassador Kelly Degnan made after the negative attitude of our government to the issue of joining the sanctions established against Russia. The Prime Minister of Georgia, Irakli Garibashvili, stated that Georgia would not join these sanctions, since this would cause damage not to Russia, but to our own country, and the comment of the American ambassador was as follows: “Today, in such a situation, it is very important to demonstrate unity in relation to Russian aggression which kills thousands of Ukrainian citizens and destroys Ukrainian cities. The purpose of the sanctions is to force Russia to change its actions. I want to stress that no one is asking the Georgian government to impose bilateral sanctions. What we expect from all countries is the coordination of efforts in the interests of international sanctions against Russian aggression.”
24127	27	How do you like? “We are not asking you to establish bilateral sanctions, but coordination is needed on sanctions issues,” the distinguished Ambassador points out to us. And if Georgia becomes stubborn and behaves differently than Ms. Degnan teaches us, she has an answer in store for such a case: “If the country does not join international sanctions, then the results of this will appear!” What could she say? - Like, do not join, and yours will take ?! Of course not. Meaning you'll be sorry. And this is a direct threat, clear and unvarnished.
24127	29	The current Georgian leadership is unacceptable to the West because, unlike the Saakashvili government, it refused to join Western sanctions and join the war with Russia. This is where the dog is buried and lies the main reason for such hostility of the collective West to the current ruling power. The West needs such power and leaders here who, like Saakashvili and Zelensky, will declare war on Russia and abandon their people, leaving them face to face with it. At the same time, the West also needs people who will in every possible way incite their government to a military campaign against Russia and demand radical actions from it.
24127	31	"The fact that the current Georgian leadership categorically does not suit the West was also convincingly confirmed by the American ambassador when she commented on the open letter to her from MP Mikhail Kavelashvili. She wrote: ""To tell the truth, I couldn't read this letter full of lies and conspiracy theories."" Is it possible, after such words, to doubt even one iota in the obviously negative attitude of the ambassador to the deputy Kavelashvili and to his letter?! No, there is no doubt about this attitude. In the same comment, the ambassador argues: “This (Kavelashvili’s letter) is really strange, and, in addition, I want to emphasize that this narrative of a parliamentarian, a former member of the Georgian Dream, about dragging Georgia into the war in a strange way echoes the narrative of party members…” . You can’t say it more clearly through the mouth of a diplomat – I can’t stand Deputy Kavelashvili just as I can’t stand the entire Georgian Dream, because they operate according to the same narrative."
24127	33	It is quite obvious that the West has completely hated the “Georgian Dream”, because it is not going to join the sanctions against Russia, nor does it intend to start a war against it, as this will destroy Georgia. However, the West does not care about the question whether Georgia will perish or not, just as it is not interested in whether Ukraine perishes or not. They need Georgia there, which has joined the war with the Russian Federation, they need more and more provocations against Russia.
24127	35	"Oh, how they need Mikheil Saakashvili today!.. They need him here like air, and it is for this, presumably, that he illegally, in a cargo container, made his way to Georgia. If the ex-president had the opportunity to turn around, he would not only invade Tskhinvali, but also go to Moscow along with his marshals and generals - Giga Makarashvili, Digmelashvili (I'm sorry, but I couldn't remember the name), Misha Mshvildadze, Tako Charkviani, Salome Samadashvili, Ekoy Kherkheulidze, Gubaz Sanikidze, Dato Akubardia and his wife… I would have gone, and even if I hadn’t forced Russia to tear my hair out, I would have sacrificed Georgia anyway, and for the umpteenth time! But this is exactly what our ""strategic partner"" and the ambassador representing him need. What's incomprehensible here?!"
24127	37	"Judge Lasha Chkhikvadze, who passed the guilty verdict on Nika Gvaramia, explicitly states that after that he was immediately contacted by a representative of the US Embassy, ​​who said: the ambassador is interested in why he, the judge, passed a guilty verdict and why he applied imprisonment as a punishment. How do you like such an ""interest"" in the sentencing of the ambassador of the helmsman of world democracy?! They constantly tell us about the independence of the court, but as soon as these statements run into a tendentious interest in a particular case, they arranged an interrogation for the judge. Moreover, not somewhere in their own country, but in another state."
24127	39	"That's what American ""democracy"" teaches us! Have you guessed yet why they were interested in the fate of this Gvaramy? Yes, because, if we paraphrase a little Franklin Roosevelt's famous statement about the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza, Gvaramia may be a son of a bitch, but their (the West's) son of a bitch. No one could be forced to bark at the Russians with such poisonous Russophobia as Gvaramia. That is why they were so “stuck” on his isolation in prison; jammed at such a level that the ambassador gave the judge a thieves' showdown. You can't say otherwise."
24127	41	Nika Gvaramia himself also responded on Facebook in connection with all this. He was excited and outraged, naturally, not by the way the American ambassador dared to put her unwashed hands into the decision of the Georgian court, but by the fact that all this, it turns out, leads to the discrediting of our strategic partner: “On the part of the authorities, this fact is absolutely disgusting and unprecedented discrediting and blackmailing our main strategic partner, which should be considered as part of the open anti-Western campaign of the Georgian Dream.
24127	43	"What kind of anti-Western campaign are you talking about, having angered both God and the devil, the sinner Gvaramia! In your opinion, if the authorities protect their people and their country from being drawn into the war, this is an anti-Western campaign?! Or what can be said about the West itself, which cannot find support in Ukraine other than Zelensky and Arakhamia, and in Georgia is forced to place its hopes on people like Saakashvili and you! Nothing, they will gradually “tie up” not only you, but also false informers completely devoid of conscience, led by a certain Gogashvili, who fed you and your journalists, and then all your atrocities and lies will surface; and all around will shudder from the abomination of your flesh and the stench of your souls. And then no ambassador will help you. She has already given herself away, just like you, and she will have to leave our country. However, until this happens, you will probably still fight a lot, again try to destroy our Motherland, plunging it into a destructive hurricane of war, want to stage a coup d'etat and once again get enough of Georgian blood - you openly promised from the TV screen: “I will drink your blood! I will drink your blood!"" At the same time, with a disgusting grimace, he absorbed some kind of blood-colored liquid. Who knows, maybe it really was blood?!. Everything can be expected from you."
24127	45	This is your essence - the representatives of the dirtiest forces of the West in Georgia, for whom the last times are coming, and therefore you are frantically waving your tails. All for nothing, the era of your masters is ending and your time is running out. See, Joe Biden will end up like Boris Johnson and Mario Draghi. In the West, people are gradually waking up, just as they are sobering up in Georgia. People in Europe and America are already beginning to realize that hatred of Russia actually means hatred of their own peoples; that the path of war and confrontation has driven the West into a dead end from which it will not succeed; that Saakashvili, Zelensky and similar creatures are a malignant tumor on the body of politics, which must be urgently removed and cauterized. This process is currently taking place in Ukraine. They are also trying to activate it in Georgia - we must by no means stop, because we have already cut out the malignant tumor in the face of Saakashvili and Gvaramia, and all that remains is to sprinkle this place with salt or cauterize with iodine. What can you do, the procedure is painful, but mandatory.
24130	1	The State Duma predicted a crushing response to Kyiv in the event of a strike on the Crimean bridge
24130	3	If Kyiv tries to strike at the Crimean bridge, the Russian response will be crushing and will not leave Ukraine a chance to recover. This statement was made by State Duma deputy Mikhail Sheremet, his words are quoted by RIA Novosti.
24130	5	“An attempt by Ukrainian nationalists to attack the Crimean bridge will result in a crushing blow,” the parliamentarian said.
24130	7	According to Sheremet, if such a provocation is attempted, Ukrainian decision-making centers and logistics hubs will be hit.
24130	9	In turn, a member of the Federation Council, Andriy Klishas, ​​said that such intentions of Kyiv once again show the need for denazification and demilitarization of the entire territory of Ukraine.
24130	11	Earlier, Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the head of the office of Vladimir Zelensky, said that the plans of the Armed Forces of Ukraine include an attack on the Crimean bridge. He explained that Ukrainian soldiers attack him at the first appearance of such a technical opportunity.
24135	1	Royal move to victory
24135	3	Today is the most mournful night in Russian history: the night of the brutal murder of the Royal Family. Mournful, but solemn: contrary to the aspirations of the murderers, it became the Night of the Victory of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers over the forces of evil.
24135	5	"The ARNS Forum ""Orthodoxy and the World in the 21st Century"" was dedicated to this event, at which he delivered a lecture ""Empire. Image of the Future"". Soon the Royal Procession begins from the Yekaterinburg Church on Blood, erected on the site of the regicide, to Ganina Yama, where the bodies of the martyrs were destroyed."
24135	7	Every time I participate in this procession, I experience an amazing feeling of spiritual and national unity. But today it is special: many thousands of Russian Orthodox people who arrived in Yekaterinburg on the Tsar's Days are right now conciliarly praying to the Royal Passion-Bearers for the Russian Victory, stolen from us in 1917, when the Russian Empire was already preparing for the Bosphorus operation and the liberation of Constantinople - Constantinople.
24135	9	Today, in the Donbass and Ukraine, our valiant warriors are returning Russia to its historical path. I am sure that their victories are accomplished by the heavenly intercession of the Holy Passion-Bearer Sovereign, invisibly present, as the Master of the Russian Land, on the battlefields.
24135	11	Happy Victory Night, Orthodox! Holy Royal Passion-Bearers, pray to God for us!
24138	1	Latvian authorities support NATO expansion to the north
24138	3	Who would have thought just six months ago that the Latvian parliament would unanimously vote for the ratification of the protocols on accession of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty.
24138	5	The events that began on February 24 launched the process of abandoning the military neutrality of the two EU states, which occupy the 6th and 4th places respectively in terms of territory.
24138	7	“Taking into account the war launched by Russia in Ukraine, Russia’s aggressive rhetoric and violent methods of foreign policy,” said Rihards Kols (National Association), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Seimas, “the risks of conflicts and escalation of instability in the Baltic Sea region have increased significantly.”
24138	9	"Agreeing to a political decision by Helsinki and Stockholm would thus ""shrink Russia's window of opportunity."" R. Coles drew attention to the fact that since the early 1990s, both countries ""to a certain extent gradually approached NATO"", ""participated in many NATO operations."""
24138	11	- We will all benefit from the entry of Sweden and Finland into NATO - both the alliance itself, accepting two mature democracies advocating democratic and legal values, and the Baltic Sea region specifically. The security policy and military capabilities of Sweden and Finland, as well as the desire for rapid further development, do not raise questions. And we can be sure that the collective security guarantees provided for in Article 5 will be significantly strengthened.
24138	13	"The head of the Latvian delegation of the Baltic Sea Parliamentary Assembly Janis Vucans (Union of Greens and Peasants) noted that in the context of Finland's accession to NATO, the status of the Åland Islands belonging to it, an autonomous region, which for a century was not only neutral, but also a demilitarized territory, will also be changed. The question also arises of deploying NATO forces on the Swedish island of Gotland. One way or another, the representative of the opposition SZK called for voting ""only for""."
24138	15	"It is worth noting that in the debate on the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO, the issue of the Arctic was also mentioned, which, according to deputy Kols, “was chosen by alternative regimes as a target for spreading their imperialist ambitions, like Russia, but also economic ambitions, like, say, , China""."
2414	3	The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, made a statement about the infringement of everything Russian. Now not only Ukraine is used for this, the minister noted.
2414	5	The masks have been torn off. We all see. Now Ukraine is not being used to infringe on everything Russian. The whole West has received a command to face,” the head of the Foreign Ministry said, answering questions from journalists.
2414	7	"According to the minister, today we are dealing with a situation where ""you are attacked simply because you have a Russian passport and went into a store, and they took you for a Russian."" And this is what the ""enlightened West"" does, too."
2414	9	The current Russophobia in Western countries can be considered a verdict on Western civilization, Lavrov noted.
2414	11	He also stated that Russia would demand that Ukraine repeal the legislation directed against Russian speakers.
2414	13	"Earlier Sergey Lavrov stated that the negotiations with Ukraine are going hard. The latter ""refuses his own proposals."""
2414	15	The Ukrainian side, although it seems to have expressed understanding of the things that should be agreed upon during the negotiations, is constantly changing its position,” the Russian Foreign Minister explained.
2414	17	The West intends to keep our country in a state of hostilities for as long as possible, Lavrov added.
2414	19	They expect to continue to pump weapons to Ukraine, - said the minister.
24140	3	The United States is on its knees and suffers one historic humiliation after another on the world stage. This opinion was expressed by former US President Donald Trump, speaking at the America First Policy Institute forum in Washington.
24140	5	He explained that under him, Washington was a leader in the issue of energy resources, and gasoline prices and inflation were low and the United States was respected. Now, he pointed out, the US is begging other countries for energy, inflation and fuel prices are at record highs, and millions of migrants are pouring into the country from unsecured borders.
24140	7	“The country is going to hell very quickly,” Trump lamented.
24140	9	"Earlier, Trump accused the current head of state, Joe Biden, of turning the United States into a ""poor country."" He recalled that America ""bows the knee only to God, and to no one else."""
24140	11	On July 15, Trump announced that he had made a decision regarding participation in the 2024 presidential election. The politician said that he is still considering when to announce it - before or after the autumn midterm congressional elections, but expressed confidence in victory if he participates in the election race.
24141	1	Volodin blamed the US for the coronavirus pandemic
24141	3	Coronavirus spread from US biological laboratories, America became the culprit of the pandemic. This was stated by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin in his Telegram channel.
24141	5	The politician issued accusations against the United States in response to the statement of the American scientist and head of the commission on COVID-19 Jeffrey Sachs, who said that the coronavirus was most likely created in an American laboratory.
24141	7	“Millions of sick and dead people, the global economic crisis, a drop in people’s living standards are the consequences of COVID-19 for which Washington needs to be held accountable,” the speaker of the lower house of parliament said.
24141	9	According to him, in response to the US accusations, President Joe Biden is silent. This is explained, according to Volodin, by the fear of the American leader to name the real culprit of the pandemic.
24141	11	The politician pointed to the need to declassify the military biological developments of the United States and stop them. He called America to account for the spread of COVID-19, and also stated the need to compensate states affected by the pandemic for losses.
24141	13	"Earlier, Volodin had already allowed a leak of COVID-19 from an American laboratory. Then he suggested that the United States continues to work on modeling the virus in parallel, and if it is not stopped, the world will be ""hostage to new and new situations."""
24154	1	The Foreign Ministry considers the inevitable cooperation between Russia and the West in the future
24154	3	The West, after the completion of a special military operation, will have to live and cooperate with Russia, the conditions for this are being set now, Dmitry Polyansky, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the world organization, said at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Ukraine.
24154	5	“By supplying Ukraine with long-range artillery systems and MLRS, you, in fact, shift the conditional security line necessary for the peaceful development of the mentioned regions further to the west, thus clarifying the goals and objectives of our special military operation. Think about this, as well as the fact that after its completion you, one way or another, will still have to live next to us and cooperate. You now largely set the conditions for this stage yourself, ”TASS quotes Polyansky.
24154	7	He also pointed out that the willingness of the West to help Ukrainians kill Donetsk and Luhansk children is unlikely to be forgotten, both by the Ukrainian and Russian people.
24154	9	Earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian side does not record changes in the positions of the West and its readiness to make concessions on the Ukrainian crisis.
24154	11	"Readers of the New York Post appreciated the statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called on China to ""remain neutral"" and not help Russia."
24154	13	“I hope to see the day when this corrupt NATO stooge of Zelensky is captured, stripped naked (no more fake military T-shirts), chained, then whipped and sent to eastern Ukraine to face a real trial for his war crimes.” , - wrote Freddie, RIA Novosti reports.
24154	15	"""Did he say that before or after the Vogue photo shoot?"" – noted the user ata777."
24154	17	"""If America can help Ukraine, why can't China help Russia?"" asked Oksure."
24154	19	“Oh, so now you want to tell China what to do? You are a laughing stock,” wrote Ralph Holloway.
24154	21	Earlier, the American media wrote that Zelensky should not be dismissive of the internal problems of the United States, while demanding further support from Washington.
24156	1	Chile's bishops object to draft constitution over abortion and euthanasia
24156	3	His categorical rejection of the changes in the Constitution of Chile, legalizing euthanasia and abortion, declared the country's Catholic bishops. This was reported on July 23 by the Catholic portal Crux.
24156	5	“We condemn norms that allow termination of pregnancy, leave open the possibility of euthanasia, distort the understanding of the family, limit the freedom of parents in raising children, as well as those that impose certain restrictions on the right to education and freedom of religion,” the bishops said in a statement.
24156	7	“We consider it especially serious to introduce abortion, which in the proposed text of the constitution is called the “right to voluntary termination of pregnancy,” the priests emphasize.
24156	9	Their statement also says that the rule that opens the door to abortion not only excludes the participation of the father in this decision, but simultaneously gives the right to personal and institutional conscientious objection to military service.
24156	11	Regarding the right to assisted suicide and euthanasia, the bishops believe that “it is an ambiguous right because it aims to solve the problem by deliberately ending human life. This is its dehumanizing nature, because it encourages a “disposable culture” and can make the lives of people already weakened by the disease even more fragile.”
24156	13	"They also accused the article of the Constitution of distorting the concept of the family, recognizing ""families in their various forms, manifestations and ways of life, not limiting them exclusively to filial and consanguineous ties."""
24156	15	“Public debate in recent weeks shows us that the proposed text has not elicited widespread and universal acceptance,” the bishops wrote in a statement. “Then we are faced with a choice between two highly polarized positions, and that makes it difficult for every citizen to decide.”
24156	17	Recall that on July 4, after a year-long drafting process, a new version of the constitution was presented to President Gabriel Boric. In October 2020, 78% of Chile's voters supported the creation of a new Constitution as part of the abandonment of the legacy of the 17-year rule of dictator General Augusto Pinochet.
24156	19	The rewrite of the constitution was approved by the government after massive protests in 2019 brought the country to a standstill, and although Boric was not yet in power at the time, he poured most of his political capital into the project.
24156	21	The new constitution will be one of the longest in the world. Compared to the document of the Pinochet era, it is broader and enshrines many innovations, including freedom of speech, abortion, the right to clean air and water, and the state's national health service.
24156	23	However, the first reaction to the document was negative, including because it would lead to the exclusion of the Senate from the country's current bicameral Congress.
24157	1	Permitted murders: Patriarch Kirill compared abortion with the death penalty
24157	3	The Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus' Kirill, during his speech at the opening of the XXIX International Educational Readings, touched upon the issue of abortion, comparing them with the death penalty, which is prohibited in Russia. “Society drives itself into a trap of legal contradictions.
24157	5	“Society drives itself into a trap of legal contradictions. If we refuse the death penalty, recognizing the inviolability of life, then why is abortion and euthanasia considered acceptable? After all, human life is destroyed here and there,” said His Holiness.
24157	7	In addition, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church called it unacceptable the creation of state and public structures that, under the pretext of protecting children, interfere in family affairs.
24157	9	“The unreasonable removal of children is a line that cannot be crossed. This is a red line,” the Patriarch emphasized.
24158	1	US reputation in the EU collapsed after the tragedy in Texas and the decision on abortion
24158	3	Massive armed attacks and the overturning of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion have undermined the reputation of the United States in Europe, Axios reports with reference to a public opinion poll on July 27.
24158	5	According to data obtained as part of a survey by Morning Consult, the reputation of the United States in European countries has significantly strengthened since the start of the Russian special operation to denazify Ukraine. Within two weeks of the start of the operation, an average of 9% more respondents favored the US, pushing that figure to around 25% by the end of May.
24158	7	However, the honeymoon was short-lived, company experts say, and after the shooting of young children at a school in the Texas city of Uvalde, as well as after the cancellation of the Supreme Court decision on abortion, the number of those who favor the United States fell, and by today fluctuates around the mark of 13-15%.
24158	9	The company's specialists draw attention to the fact that the country's image abroad can affect a wide range of issues: from its foreign policy effectiveness to economic influence.
24158	11	“A study of how a country’s position in a given market can affect its exports to that market shows that the consequences can be huge: one study found that a one position increase in the world ranking of countries by the reputation of their products is associated with a 2% increase in exports. , and that the reputation of the population of the country can also influence the volume of exports,” they noted.
24158	13	“The situation is similar with tourism, another industry highly dependent on foreign demand: a number of studies have shown a close relationship between the image of a country abroad and the desire of tourists to visit it,” Morning Consult added.
24160	1	US abortion supporters vote less frequently than opponents: poll
24160	3	Opponents of overturning the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion are less likely to vote than those who support or are indifferent to the move, The Hill reported citing a July 29 poll.
24160	5	"According to a public opinion poll, the results of which were published on July 29, 65% of respondents believe that the overturning of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ""Roe v. Wade"" was a ""significant loss for women's rights"". 35% do not agree with them. However, only 52% of those who opposed the overturning of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade intend to go to the midterm elections, which will be held in November this year, while those who are indifferent to this event, to the elections 70% of respondents are ready to go."
24160	7	Only a third of women under 40 say they will vote with confidence, despite being in the demographic most concerned about access to abortion.
24160	9	The figures are a blow to Democrats, who see abortion as a major electoral issue and a way to revitalize their supporter base in a difficult election year. Democratic candidates at all levels, and the groups that represent them, have been vehemently critical of their opponents for their stance on abortion in recent months.
24162	1	"The Russian Embassy in the United States commented on reports of ""strike"" on the ZNPP"
24162	2	The Russian Embassy in the United States called for an end to Russophobic fabrications about strikes on the ZNPP
24162	4	"WASHINGTON, August 8 - RIA Novosti. The Russian Embassy in the United States, after reports from American media accusing Russian forces of ""strike"" on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, called on American journalists to stop repeating ""Russophobic fabrications."""
24162	5	We call on the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency to condemn the criminal actions of Kyiv and take urgent measures to prevent provocations at radiation hazardous facilities in Ukraine. And American journalists - to stop bawling Russophobic fabrications, - the diplomatic mission says in a widespread commentary.
24162	7	The American media launched a sweeping disinformation campaign, the embassy stressed. And the shelling of the ZNPP by the Armed Forces of Ukraine creates a real threat to the nuclear security of Europe, the commentary says.
24162	9	Earlier, Energodar authorities said that on Sunday night, Ukrainian troops launched a strike from the Uragan MLRS at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, fragments and a rocket engine fell about 400 meters from the station’s operating power unit. The shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the Zaporozhye NPP, in case of damage to the power unit, threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of residents of Ukraine, foreign Europe, and Asia, the city administration stressed.
24162	10	ZNPP has been under the control of the Russian military since March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the justification for taking the power plant under protection from the point of view of preventing leaks of nuclear and radioactive materials. The department also recalled that the Ukrainian operator continues to manage the station.
24166	1	"New victims on the global ""green"" altar - cows and Ukrainians"
24166	3	Reading the world news of recent months, one is sometimes amazed at how completely incompatible stories can be combined in one newspaper page or in one television news release. For example, one of the main problems of the current global crisis at all levels is world hunger, which, according to UN estimates, already affects up to ten percent of the world's population and continues to expand. And now the TV presenter of some news channel reads out these data, shows the starving children of Africa or Asia, after which, without a twinge of conscience, joyfully announces the decision of the government of one or another large state within the framework of green policy to drastically reduce the number of livestock. And no one has any idea to connect these two plots together. What for? After all, Russia can always be blamed for world hunger, which Western politicians and propagandists have been actively doing lately.
24166	4	"They, however, recently had a serious headache in the form of Sri Lanka, where thoughtless green reform led to a food crisis, riots and the overthrow of power. What efforts are now being made by the Western media, environmental activists and various Soros ""anti-fake"" structures to convince the world community that the events in Sri Lanka have nothing to do with the decisions of the island government to ban inorganic fertilizers, which ultimately led to a record crop failure and food shortages. No, no, of course - it's Russia's fault, as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said bluntly. Well, yes, it was Putin who sharply reduced the harvest of tea and rice in Sri Lanka."
24166	6	Or let's take another example. For several months, the Netherlands has been rocked by protests from farmers who are outraged by the government's officially announced plans to significantly reduce the number of livestock and poultry in the country. In total, The Hague requires farm owners to reduce this figure by a third within a fairly short period of time. It will be especially difficult for the owners of cows - there the planned reduction sometimes reaches 95 percent, which will inevitably lead to ruin and business closure.
24166	8	But the Netherlands is one of the world's major meat producers, the world's fourth largest supplier of dairy products and the second largest food exporter after the United States. With a relatively small territory, this country is the seventh in terms of the number of livestock in the European Union.
24166	9	And here's what's interesting. Almost all the world's media in one way or another cover the protests of Dutch farmers and the decision of the government of Mark Rutte that caused them. But someone, in general, calculated how such a sharp blow to the farming sector in the Netherlands will affect the global food market? Has anyone linked this decision to the problem of global hunger? Oh, yes, because you can always blame Russia again. It will even be interesting to hear future explanations from Western propagandists about how Moscow influenced the decision of The Hague to reduce the number of Dutch cattle.
24166	10	"And now greens all over the world are squealing with delight over the New Zealand government's latest decision to impose a special tax on ... how to put it more culturally - methane emissions from cows. Authorities explain their ruling as follows: ""Agriculture accounts for more than half of New Zealand's methane production, and methane is a huge contributor to global warming and air pollution."""
24166	12	"Critics of the decision warn outright that it will destroy New Zealand farms. The Australian issue of The Spectator points out: ""In this case, the agricultural industry should be sacrificed on the altar of climate change - as far as one can tell, for no scientific reason, given that our collective emissions are too small to make a difference."""
24166	13	"And in the footsteps of New Zealand, Australia intends to follow, and, perhaps, other countries will follow. Environmental activists are already demanding to cut the number of New Zealand livestock by half. They argue: ""The intensive dairy industry is a false economy. While the benefits accrue to a small number of people in the industry, everyone has to pay. The costs are often borne by those who are least to blame for climate change and those who are most vulnerable."" Who will bear the burden of a rise in prices or a shortage of meat and dairy products after the disappearance of cows, green activists do not care at all. Neither do they care about the problems of global hunger, which are sure to get worse as the number of livestock in the countries that are the world's main food suppliers is reduced. And after all, none of the greens offers any other alternative. Reduce, destroy, ""destroy to the ground"" - and then? We'll see what happens next."
24166	14	"And here are only the most striking examples of the phenomenon, which in conservative circles has already received the name ""eco-tyranny"". But these problems are faced by farmers in almost all Western countries and (as we see from the example of the same Sri Lanka) a number of not the richest third world countries. In this regard, the mainstream press is more concerned about the fact that the protests of farmers against eco-tyranny give political dividends to right-wing political forces. It turns out that this is the main, almost the only problem of the West. What about world hunger? No, we didn't hear anything. While we are not talking about Russia, of course."
24166	15	But the tireless eco-activists George Soros have a new interest - Ukraine. At the moment, the pro-Western regime in Kyiv is actively proposing to use the territory of the country under its control as a testing ground for testing new types of weapons. And it does not matter how many experimental Ukrainians will die in this case. And the people of Soros already now, without waiting for the end of hostilities, are calling for turning Ukraine into a testing ground for expanding the global green experiment described above.
24166	17	"These plans were shared on the pages of the Financial Times by a senior employee of the Soros Foundation Open Society Heather Grabbe. She calls for this unique opportunity to ""create the first truly low-carbon economy in Europe."" Judging by her explanation, by this chance she means the total destruction of the Ukrainian economy. Here, for example, is what Grabbe writes: ""Steel is a good example. Ukraine's biggest source of pollution, the Mariupol Iron and Steel Works, lies in ruins."" If we consider the destruction of the Azovstal plant, which the militants of the Nazi units tried to make their fortress as a ""good example"", then this really says a lot about the plans for global eco-tyranny regarding Ukraine."
24166	18	"The Soros activist calls for the use of frozen Russian finances abroad for ""insurance of political risks"" (you must admit, a good replacement for the not very courteous term ""robbery"" was invented by the Open Society) and eventually turn Ukraine into a raw materials appendage of ""decarbonized Europe"". To do this, the European Union, according to Grabbe, should support small farms in Ukraine on the condition that they produce organic products. One would like to add: as in Sri Lanka. But such a comparison among the Greens after the well-known events is not accepted."
24166	19	"That is, they propose to expand the global green experiment to Ukraine, having previously destroyed it to the ground (you can see what a ""good example"" is the destruction of industrial giants polluting the air). How can one not ask the question: is it not for this reason that the Soros structures invested a lot of money in inciting the Ukrainian crisis, and, accordingly, in the destruction of Ukrainian statehood as such? Indeed, on the ruins it is much easier to build test sites and experiment on the experimental population. What will happen to him is secondary. After all, if a new crazy idea proves to be untenable, as it has been until now, you can always blame everything on Russia again. Not to the West! And especially not on Soros."
24169	1	"Kyiv urged to check Amnesty International for ""benefits"" from Russia"
24169	2	Ukraine urged to investigate whether Amnesty International benefits from Russia
24169	4	"In Kyiv, they called for an investigation into whether the human rights organization Amnesty International receives ""benefits"" from Russia. The corresponding requirement for verification was made by the assistant to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak, TASS reports."
24169	6	"He believes that in their latest report, human rights activists have discredited ""the concept of international humanitarian organizations"", which, he says, will have detrimental consequences."
24169	8	"On August 4, Amnesty International published a report in which they talked about the crimes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The report says that Kyiv causes ""harm to the civilian population by using weapons systems in populated areas, including schools and hospitals."" Thus, not only military law is violated, but also international humanitarian law."
24171	3	“Among these neighboring peoples, there are still things that we cannot fully understand,” Henrihs Soms, professor of history at Daugavpils University, speaks at Latvijas Avīze.
24171	5	He draws attention to the changes in his native land: “In peaceful conditions in Latgale, there were many people who did not like the Latvian language, who believed that Riga was taking all the resources, that the state had a wrong policy, such an amorphous electorate that supported the policy of Russia.
24171	7	In connection with the war in Ukraine, the number of these people has decreased. For now it is difficult to say so simply: “I am for Russia!” Now it is intellectually necessary to invent why the Russian authorities and the state like it if they attack Ukraine, and why this is welcome.
24171	9	Most of the Russian-speakers have become quiet, others say about the war in Ukraine: “Latvians, don’t interfere between Russians and Ukrainians, you don’t understand anything!” There were Russians from Daugavpils who also said so in March, when the flag of Ukraine was hoisted at the Daugavpils Musical High School and the uproar began. And he needed to listen and think.
24176	3	The policy of anti-Russian sanctions of the European Union is thoroughly erroneous, only mutual respect will help overcome the crisis that has arisen, said Laszlo Kever, speaker of the Hungarian parliament.
24176	5	"“The outside world can also learn a lot from us. For example, EU leaders in Brussels - if they ever grace us with their sincere interest - may learn the truth of the Turkish proverb: ""If you don't get on a horse, don't swing your leg."" This is useful knowledge, because the EU leaders… with their thoroughly misguided sanctions policy, for example, were swinging their legs without a horse under them… The sad outcome of this will be that the EU leaders in Brussels will smash the entire European economy to dust along with them,” said Kever, speaking to the guests of the festival of traditions of the Huns and Turks ""Kurultai"", RIA Novosti reports."
24176	7	According to him, it will be possible to overcome crises and challenges only “if both in the West and in the East all people who do not want to erase or falsify the past find each other and unite with each other, but want to learn from it; those who do not want to appropriate the present and the future, but want to share it with others, mutually respecting each other's faith, culture, homeland, national state and human dignity.
24176	9	Earlier, the French media recalled how French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on March 1 that anti-Russian sanctions are “terrifyingly” effective.
24183	3	The developers of the Google maps mapping service sent an official request to the Russian leadership with a request to clarify Moscow's forecasts about a possible revision of the borders of European states in the next 10 years.
24183	5	“We know that there are many talented analysts in Russia whose models of the future almost always come true. Since 2005, the map of Europe has changed several times, we would be very grateful to Russia if it shared its forecasts on the prospects for changing borders until 2032,” said Lars Rasmussen, head of Google maps.
24185	3	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the job offer that Vladimir Zelensky made to him during their meeting in Kyiv. After the end of his term as head of the British government, Johnson may take the post of governor of the Odessa region.
24185	5	According to Zelensky, the post of head of the Odessa administration was repeatedly and successfully held by foreigners - starting with the Duke de Richelieu and ending with ex-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili. Opinion polls show that Johnson has an 11% rating in Odessa, higher than any other gubernatorial candidate in the past 20 years. Boris Johnson said on social networks that he had not yet accepted the offer, because he was not sure that the head of the Southwestern Federal District would approve it.
24186	3	Moscow urbanist Daniil Kurdyukov, who relocated to Georgia in March, offered to translate road signs in Tbilisi into Russian and even opened a fundraiser for this purpose. According to the designer, the Georgian language is incomprehensible to migrants from Russia, so Russian or English should be used instead.
24186	5	Kurdyukov plans to raise about $2,000. With this money, he will create a design for new street signs, and then transfer it to the city authorities.
24186	7	“Let's be honest, few people understand these squiggles - even if you translate them with a Google camera, it's still impossible to remember, they simply merge in your eyes. There are signs in English in the center, but living in the center is expensive, many settle on the outskirts. Therefore, it is necessary to make new signs and make them humanly - in Russian or in English, ”he wrote on Facebook
24189	3	The office of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky invited the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to visit the new 95th quarter beer restaurant, which opened in the center of Kyiv. According to the President, the Crown Prince will not be able to taste such pork ribs anywhere else.
24189	5	The restaurant was opened by Zelensky's business partners in the 95th quarter studio, the president's office said. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader himself is not the owner of the establishment: the shares in it belong to his step-uncle and second cousin. The menu includes more than 30 varieties of German beer, pork ribs, Ukrainian borscht, dumplings, palyanytsya and other dishes of national cuisine. In addition to entertainment and treats, Zelensky intends to discuss with Prince Mohammed the possibility of lowering oil prices.
2423	3	Chargé d'Affaires of the United States in Ukraine Christina Quinn announced the parallel between the President of the Russian Federation and the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Both started a bloody war, killing people indiscriminately and ignoring the nations.
2423	5	"Queen announced this in an interview for RBC-Ukraine. According to Quinn, both Hitler and Putin both started a ""war of choice"". The US Charge d'Affaires in Ukraine noted that our country did not provoke aggression from the Russian Federation, which the country constantly promotes among its population."
2433	2	Political scientist Markelov told how Western aid harms Ukraine
2433	4	The Russian military continues successful actions to denazify Ukraine. Political adviser Sergei Markelov, specifically for 360, told why the Russian army is hitting factories and warehouses, and also what is fraught with Western help for Ukraine.
2433	5	Russian political strategist, political scientist Sergei Markelov
2433	7	Next is direct speech.
2433	8	About technology in Ukraine
2433	10	In the Kharkov region, on the outskirts of Lozovaya, Russian troops destroyed the buildings of a forging and mechanical plant with long-range missiles. They were engaged in the restoration and repair of armored vehicles.
2433	12	According to 2021 data, there were almost 450 enterprises in Ukraine where military equipment could be serviced and repaired. Ukraine during the Soviet era occupied almost 17% of the military-defense complex. Although most of it is no longer there, today we see enough industrial zones that can produce, as well as current, operational and strategic repairs of military equipment.
2433	14	"On average, Russian troops have ""nullified"" about 50% of such enterprises. Such targeted testing of such industrial zones, where military equipment can be stored, altered, repaired and simply hidden, is an indispensable element of our actions."
2433	16	For Ukraine, this is a problem of defense capability and the availability of military equipment. On the one hand, it is destroyed catastrophically quickly, on the other hand, if it is damaged, it is no longer subject to repair. Therefore, the Ukrainian side is shouting at the top of its lungs that they really need new equipment to recharge.
2433	17	About aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
2433	19	Russian air defense shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 in the Slavyansk region, 13 Ukrainian UAVs were destroyed in the Donbass, Kharkiv and Zaporozhye regions. These air losses are very sensitive for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
2433	21	Military insiders give approximately the following statistics: in the first month of a special military operation, 5-6% of aviation equipment and all kinds of drones left the existing ones per day. In the second month, a little less - they went out by 2-3% per day. Today, by the hundredth day, there is somewhere in the region of 0.5-1% of the destruction of air military equipment per day.
2433	23	Statistics - both ours and not ours - have long shown that Ukraine does not have flight personnel and weapons that can conduct military operations from the air. And she collects from Europe one by one, using gray, white, black schemes for the supply of equipment.
2433	24	On Western aid and its consequences
2433	26	Of course, Ukraine is really looking forward to the F16 military multipurpose fighters promised by the Americans, which they promised to deliver at the end of June or in the middle of July. However, according to experts, the planes will be able to arrive in a maximum of three to four months. After all, to transfer 100 military aircraft across half the globe is a serious logistical operation.
2433	28	Strategically and tactically, the Russian armed forces have created a balance in which it is unlikely that anything will stop us. It seems to me that from the point of view of political and military expertise, we already understand how equipment appears on the battlefield. And, accordingly, we can start to beat them from the moment they enter the territory of Ukraine.
2433	30	All the injections that the West makes in the form of various support for the troops of Ukraine do not complicate our work. We are moving forward and achieving our goals, taking the territories designated by our president.
2437	3	The United States forced the European Union to impose sanctions against Russia, the EU itself was not going to do this, said the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. According to her, the United States is trying to prevent the strengthening of Russia and the EU through close mutual ties.

2437	6	US policy is aimed at containing not only Russia, but also Europe, says Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.
2437	7	"Washington's actions are the implementation of a containment policy, but in this case, containment is not only Russia, it is containment of Europe as well,"" she said in an interview with Arguments and Facts."
2437	9	According to her, the United States, in particular, is trying to prevent the strengthening of ties between Russia and the EU.
2437	11	To allow close ties between Europe and Russia is to strengthen both. And it was Washington that forced the European Union to adopt sanctions, and both (U.S. Vice President Joseph) Biden and (U.S. Secretary of State John) Kerry recognized this. The European Union did not intend to do this, but did it under pressure. How pressed? What arguments did the States use? A very good question for the future. And someday we will find out, - said Zakharova.
2455	1	Cultural figures urged to withdraw funding from artists who criticize the SVO in Ukraine
2455	3	Artists, writers, directors and representatives of other creative professions discussed on the air of the press center of the Patriot media group the reasons for the growth of Russophobic sentiments among domestic cultural figures and ways to overcome this disease.
2455	5	The media report on the plans of the Russian government to audit budgetary spending on culture. Sources say that the validity and fitness for purpose of allocating budgetary funds to support cinema, the creation of television series and theatrical productions in the period from 2012 to 2020 raises doubts. As a result, works that discredit the moral values ​​of the country and distort its history and present were created at the expense of the budget. Preferences from the state are received by a narrow circle of authors, the vast majority of whom left Russia after the start of the SVO and make slanderous statements in relation to the goals and methods of the special operation in Ukraine, as well as to high-ranking statesmen.
2455	7	Member of the Russian Union of Writers, public figure, poet and teacher Oleg Tarunov considers the spread of anti-patriotic sentiments among representatives of creative professions to be the activities of foreign non-governmental organizations that lure creative Russians to their side by banal bribery.
2455	9	“People of culture and art, often liberal-minded, have additional funding from abroad. The recently implemented law on foreign agents allows them to enter the stream of the media sphere, to be constantly in the frame, it is naturally easier for such a person to receive some kind of subsidies and funding. And a patriotic poet, I can classify myself as such, does not shout about himself at every step, he writes a work in solidarity with what is happening, which is a reflection of his soul, morality, moral qualification, his position in this situation, ”- Oleg Tarunov said.
2455	11	According to Yevgeny Antipov, an artist and publicist, president of the Association of Creative Associations of the North-West, pro-Western cultural figures are, as a rule, more enterprising and obsessed with money. In their system of values, wealth prevails over spiritual and moral ideals, so they easily betray their homeland and their compatriots, the publicist believes.
2455	13	“Such people tend to be vulgar. They have a weather vane inside: in which direction the wind blows, they turn in that direction - this is what ensured their survival and profitability. And we all know that for the last 30 years the most well-paid topic has been Russophobia. People who are now criticizing their country, some of them were convinced Russophobe, some joined, and some became Russophobe for the company - since they give money, why not blather? Thus, a whole pool of creative people, sometimes even talented ones, was formed, who are engaged in frank deconstruction of our society, ”explained Evgeny Antipov.
2455	15	Russian officials also played their part in the formation of an anti-patriotic stratum of creative workers, believes a member of the Arctic Academy of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Geographical Society, director, producer and screenwriter Sergei Nadein.
2455	17	“Officers are to blame - this is one hundred percent, because they make decisions on the direction of funding for creative projects. Before issuing a grant, they, of course, get acquainted with the content of the ideas that they contain,” Sergey Nadein noted.
2455	19	In his opinion, now leaving Russia are mainly those cultural figures who had long planned to do this, but did not want to lose the source of their well-being.
2455	21	“They were ready to leave a long time ago, they never loved our country, our people, now a very “convenient” opportunity has turned up for them,” the director believes.
2455	23	Experts support the intention of government agencies to revise the policy of providing budget funding for the implementation of creative projects in the direction of encouraging their patriotic orientation. At the same time, it is not ruled out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, some form of censorship of the content of works of art should be introduced in the Russian Federation.
2455	25	“In this case, I think some censorship is appropriate. When such terrible events take place as now, how can you speak out against your country?” — said the writer and publisher Victoria Sherwood.
2455	27	Yevgeny Antipov believes that such censorship should at least be internal for creative workers.
2455	29	“The fact is that culture is a system of delimitations, it is self-censorship, censorship of introduced history, mental,” the artist explained.
2455	31	Oleg Tarunov considers creative workers who loudly declare their opposition to Russia's actions to force Ukraine to peace as outright traitors.
2455	33	"“To accept or not to accept back such cultural figures is everyone's business. But in my opinion, what they have done now is at least an indirect factor that can be classified by the phrase ""treason."" I think that our simple people will not accept these people, because they feel their real attitude towards themselves, no matter how they try to mislead people, ”the poet believes."
2455	35	In his opinion, the majority of Russian citizens are aware of the difficult problem our servicemen are solving in Ukraine.
2456	3	Subject: Russian military special operation in Ukraine
2456	5	Russophobia in the West has reached unimaginable limits. The culture that has always served as a pillar of international cooperation has suffered. Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Degas' Russian Dancers are canceled in Europe.
2456	7	The anti-Russian agenda of many Western countries is gaining momentum every day. Against the backdrop of Russia's special operation in Ukraine in Europe and America, they took up arms not only against the political elite of Russia and the Russian economy, but also, which was not the case before, against Russian culture.
2456	8	United Kingdom
2456	10	"The National Gallery in London has changed the name of Edgar Degas's well-known painting ""Russian Dancers"" to ""Ukrainian Dancers"", follows from the data on the museum's website. The decision was made after the relevant appeals of the Ukrainians in social networks, reports RIA Novosti."
2456	12	"""The title of this painting has been the subject of ongoing discussion for many years and has been covered in the scientific literature, however it has received increased attention over the past month due to the current situation, so we felt it was the right moment to update the title of the painting to better reflect it. topic,"" said a representative of the National Gallery."
2456	14	The painting depicts dancers from Eastern Europe who visited France in the 1990s and performed at the Moulin Rouge and the Casino de Paris. All the girls on the canvas are dressed in long skirts and white shirts. An important feature, according to Internet users, is the flower wreaths on their heads, all of which are depicted in national Ukrainian colors - yellow and blue.
2456	16	"The canvas of the French impressionist of the early twentieth century is not currently exhibited in the gallery. The National Gallery also announced that due to Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, it will not include Raphael's painting ""The Holy Family"" from the State Hermitage collection in the exhibition ""Credit Suisse: Raphael"", which is scheduled to start on April 9."
2456	18	"Earlier, according to The Independent, the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra decided to remove the Pyotr Tchaikovsky overture from the program. The orchestra considered the performance of the overture ""1812"" allegedly ""unacceptable at such a time."""
2456	19	Germany
2456	21	"In early March, the Bavarian State Opera severed ties with opera singer Anna Netrebko and conductor Valery Gergiev for ""insufficiently distancing themselves"" from Russia's special operation in Ukraine."
2456	23	"""Due to Russia's terrible offensive war in Ukraine and the lack of sufficient distancing on the part of Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko, the Bavarian State Opera is nullifying all existing relationships,"" wrote the opera's executive director, Serge Derny."
2456	25	Also, the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra stopped cooperating with Gergiev. This decision was taken by the mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter.
2456	27	Munich parts ways with Valery Gergiev. From now on, there will be no more concerts of the IFO under his leadership, - Izvestia reports the words of the head of the city.
2456	29	I hoped that he would reconsider his very positive assessment of the Russian president. He didn't. In the current situation, however, a clear signal to the orchestra, the public and the city would be necessary for further cooperation. After this has not followed, it remains only to leave immediately,” Reiter said.
2456	31	Gergiev has served as chief conductor of the IFO since 2015. The contract with him was calculated until 2025.
2456	33	Italy
2456	35	The University of Milan in Italy has removed books by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky from its program amid the conflict in Ukraine. This was done to avoid potential controversy, the university said.
2456	37	However, this news greatly shocked users of social networks, in connection with which the university authorities allowed Dostoevsky to teach again, reports Regnum.
2456	39	By analogy with the Bavarian scandal, the name of the prima donna Netrebko was removed from the March posters of La Scala.
2456	41	"The Milan theater has reported that one of the best sopranos in the world is ""sick"". However, the star of the opera scene herself replied: ""I am healthy, but I will not come,"" RIA Novosti reports."
2456	42	USA
2456	44	New York's Carnegie Hall has canceled the participation of Valery Gergiev, who was supposed to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The name of pianist Denis Matsuev was also deleted from the poster.
2456	46	"Carnegie Hall did not name the reason. However, the American press voiced the fears of the leadership of the famous concert hall and the board of trustees of Carnegie Hall that ""Maestro Gergiev's participation in concerts in such a situation could be misinterpreted and the wrong signal could be sent to society,"" writes RIA Novosti."
2456	48	On the Day of the Cultural Worker, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech in which he drew attention to the attack on Russian culture in the West, but expressed the hope that it was through the culture that binds and unites us all that the truth will find its way.
2456	50	"The notorious culture of cancellation"" has turned into ""cancellation of culture"". Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Rakhmaninov are excluded from concert posters. Russian writers and their books are also banned. The last time such a mass campaign to destroy objectionable literature was carried out by the Nazis in Germany almost 90 years ago. We We know well and remember from newsreel footage how books are burned right on the squares,” Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports the President’s words."
2459	2	"Former British Prime Minister Brown recalled how he was ""forced"" to look up to Putin"
2459	4	"The former head of the British government Gordon Brown, in his words, ""never had any illusions about what Putin was like."" The politician shared his memories of his visit to Moscow in 2006, when he was put on a ""very low chair."" Speaking about recent events, Brown criticized the global disunity on the issue of sanctions against the Russian Federation. He claims that the Russian president allegedly ""reacts only to an uncompromising show of force."" Read more in the article ""Gazety.Ru""."
2459	6	Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke in an interview with The Telegraph about his visit to Moscow back in 2006. In particular, he recalled how in the Kremlin he was then “forced to sit on a very low seat.”
2459	8	Brown also claims that Russian leader Vladimir Putin allegedly threatened him. “I had no illusions about what Putin was like,” said the ex-head of the British government.
2459	10	"According to him, for many years the West could not resist the President of the Russian Federation, until ""his invasion of Ukraine."" Brown also criticized global disunity, pointing out that 150 countries around the world have not imposed sanctions against Russia even after the start of a special military operation."
2459	12	"""Looking up at him"""
2459	14	Recalling his visit to the Kremlin in 2006, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Brown said he was placed in a very low seat.
2459	16	“So I looked up to Putin. He's a relatively short man, of course, and he wears those high heels.
2459	18	That day, he took out those index cards and began to read all the information he had about me, as if he wanted to prove that he knew more about me than I knew about myself. Therefore, when people say that Putin has changed and is only now threatening, I can tell you that he threatened me even then, ”said the former head of the British Cabinet.
2459	20	"""Opportunist to the nth degree"""
2459	22	"Brown believes that Putin only reacts to ""an uncompromising and unwavering show of force"":"
2459	24	“The only thing Putin understands is strength. Weakness he will use. He is an opportunist to the nth degree, ”says the former British prime minister.
2459	26	Western inaction on the “Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014,” which took place when David Cameron was prime minister, “left Putin to think he could get away with further invasions,” he said.
2459	28	Global disunity
2459	30	"In addition, Brown welcomed the ""unity of NATO"", but at the same time pointed out the problem with the coordination of sanctions."
2459	32	“What we also saw is global disunity: 82 countries refuse to support actions against Russia for violating human rights and freedoms, 150 states do not impose sanctions,” he stated.
2459	34	Brown suggested that one of the reasons for this state of affairs was the inability of the West to solve the problem of global poverty.
2459	36	“One of the reasons is that we have not shown people that Western-led globalization is about reducing poverty, improving living standards and of course fighting climate change in poorer countries, and we really need to implement their promises,” concluded the former Prime Minister of Great Britain.
2459	38	Zelensky in a T-shirt angered the French
2459	40	Against this background, Le Figaro readers were outraged by the behavior and appearance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during negotiations with French leader Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
2461	3	According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the West African strain of the monkeypox pathogen was introduced from Nigeria, where the United States has located its biolaboratories.
2461	5	At least four US-controlled biological laboratories are operating in Nigeria, where monkeypox originated, Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops (RCBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces, said on May 27.
2461	7	This strange coincidence, in his opinion, requires additional verification of specialists, writes TASS.
2461	8	- So, according to European and American media, - the speaker continued, - in the materials of the Munich Security Conference 2021, that is, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, a scenario was worked out to counter an outbreak caused by a new strain of the monkeypox virus.
2461	10	Thus, Russia calls on the WHO leadership to investigate the activities of American laboratories operating in Nigerian cities.
2469	3	June 20 is World Refugee Day. Today Ukrainian refugees are in the center of attention. What impact did the flow of migrants have on most countries, including Russia?
2469	5	Today, June 20, is World Refugee Day. Now this topic has a global scale: Ukrainian refugees are in the spotlight.
2469	7	Co-chairman of the National Strategy Council, political scientist Iosif Diskin, in a conversation with Baltnews, explained the impact of the flow of Ukrainian refugees on the situation in the world, including in the Russian Federation.
2469	9	"""Three models [of the behavior of Ukrainian refugees] are being identified. First: the Polish model, where they use another portion of migrants as a cheap force. Second: the Anglo-French annoying freeloaders. Public discontent is growing. The third model of fraternal care is Russian. I do not want to idealize the situation, there is rather unpleasant excesses, but in general, the Russian state is coping with more than a million refugees. They are looking for work, they are helped and supported,"" the expert said."
2469	11	At the same time, as Diskin noted, some believe that after the completion of the special operation, the refugees will return to Ukraine in safe conditions, and the second part will integrate into Russian society and the economy. If we count in half, then this closes the demographic losses of Russia over the past year.
2469	13	Refugees do not want to return to Western Europe: they cling with their hands, feet, teeth, so as not to return there. It is assumed that they should receive benefits, while the states, on the contrary, are trying to push them out. People came from under the bombing, from under the shelling. Relatives, work, friends, acquaintances remained there, but here everything needs to be built anew,” the political scientist continued, adding that someone quickly adapts, and someone wants to return to their native environment.
2469	15	"""Russia will do everything to quickly restore those cities that were badly damaged in the conditions of hostilities. A vivid example is Mariupol, where prefabricated houses are being built so that people can wait until major repairs are carried out in the buildings of the city,"" Diskin stated. ."
2469	17	In May, the UN published data on the number of Ukrainian refugees. Thus, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that since the beginning of the special operation, more than 6.73 million people have left the country. It is noted that most of the citizens left for Poland: 3,581,612 refugees. 989,357 Ukrainians arrived in Romania, 971,417 arrived in Russia, and 671,463 arrived in Hungary.
2469	19	Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Prosecutor General's Office to help refugees from Donbass and Ukraine:
2469	21	Particular attention should be paid to those people who arrive in Russia from Ukraine, from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Today [by mid-April] there are already about a million of them, including over a hundred thousand children. People who have been forced to leave their homes do not always have with them the documents necessary to receive material assistance, medical support, and to place their children in schools and kindergartens. I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to provide people with legal assistance, protect their rights, including considering the appeals of the victims as soon as possible. People are having a hard time, help them.
247	1	In the US, Zelensky was called a comic dictator
247	3	American propaganda shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a favorable light, inspiring US citizens with ideas about the heroism of the Kyiv authorities, said Terry Titcomb, a columnist for The American Thinker.
247	5	Titcomb stressed that Zelensky is actually a comedian who won the election with a pacifist agenda, but then turned into a dictator supported by the oligarchs.
247	7	According to the observer, the United States is sowing conflicts in different parts of the globe in order to make money on this, and is broadcasting false propaganda theses to Americans. The author of the article noted that Pentagon spokesman John Kirby never spoke at briefings about the suffering that the residents of the DPR and LPR were forced to endure from Kyiv.
247	9	Titcomb questioned why Kirby had been silent for the past eight years, during which the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the Donbass and killed thousands of civilians. And where were the tears of the Pentagon press secretary when Ukrainians burned a group of protesters in Odessa in 2014, the journalist asked.
2473	3	The victory of Gustavo Petro in the presidential elections in Colombia will have a positive impact on the trial for the release of Russian Sergei Vagin, said human rights activist, head of the CST command Artemy Semenovsky.
2473	5	"In an exclusive interview with the head of the Foundation for the Fight against Repressions (FBI), created by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, Mira Terada, the expert noted that after Petro's victory in Colombia, the West lost the sense of spinning unreliable information about some kind of ""Russian interference"" in the electoral process. Initially, they tried to portray Sergei Vagin as a person who financed the protests, was engaged in espionage activities, and was even almost connected with the Iranian Hezbollah. This whole situation was created for a flurry of fake Western media articles about ""Putin's insidious hand."""
2473	7	Now, accusations against the Russian are brought only on issues of financial fraud and illegal access to computer information. Due to the irrelevance of the West's agenda, Sergey's defenders hope that these charges will also be dropped.
2473	9	“CST command has already sent congratulations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia on the election of Gustavo Petro, where we expressed the hope that the change in the political climate in Colombia will lead to the removal of biased and politically motivated charges against Sergei Vagin and Colombian justice will show true independence and objectivity,” — Semenovsky noted.
2473	11	Now Sergei needs high-quality protection for his release, which is why a fundraiser was announced that will be sent to lawyers.
2475	1	In the Leningrad region developed a plan for the decarbonization of the region
2475	3	St. Petersburg, June 21 - RIA Novosti. The authorities of the Leningrad region have developed a draft plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the region's economy for the next 18 years, a spokesman for the regional administration told RIA Novosti.
2475	4	According to him, the draft plan was presented at a meeting with executive authorities.
2475	5	It is important to continue this work, despite the fact that the situation is difficult now, times are changing, and the topic of decarbonization will remain, and many countries where products from the Leningrad Region are sent are interested in it. We must identify the areas where we can most painlessly reduce our carbon footprint. First of all, this is an increase in forest plantations - it is necessary to use reserve lands, disturbed agricultural lands for planting forests with subsequent transfer to forestry lands, change the system of boiler houses, introduce the processing of agricultural waste, develop transport on gas and electricity, build renewable energy sources and connect to them , first of all, companies working for export,” said Alexander Drozdenko, Governor of the Leningrad Region.
2475	6	The regional administration clarified that, in the field of electricity and heat supply, fuel in boiler houses is expected to be replaced with a less carbon-intensive one, reducing heat consumption by improving the energy efficiency of houses, and building wind farms. In transport, the use of alternative fuels and the promotion of the transfer of transport to gas and electricity. As well as the creation of carbon-free zones for the introduction of technologies with low greenhouse gas emissions, the reduction of MSW volumes sent for disposal by creating additional processing facilities, the introduction of active degassing systems at landfills planned for closure, and others.
2479	3	There is good news, friends. The world is not in danger of starvation. Such that hunger-hunger, directly an epidemic with horrific consequences, - writes Yaroslav Romanchuk. — This follows from the latest OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031. It is jointly produced by the OECD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
2479	5	According to the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), there are enough grains and other agricultural raw materials in the world, although in 2022. agricultural prices have risen markedly.
2479	7	In March 2022, the FAO Food Price Index was at its highest level since 1990. In April, it decreased, but is still 30% higher than the same period in 2021.
2479	10	<<The war in Ukraine is the biggest factor of uncertainty. The complete loss of the Ukrainian export potential of wheat would lead to an increase in world prices by 19%.>>
2479	12	If the same thing happened to Russia at the same time, then prices would rise by 34% compared to the situation without the war. In this scenario, Ukraine and Russia would export 36 million tons less wheat, and other countries would increase their exports of wheat by 16 million tons, because its prices would be significantly higher.
2479	14	The OECD notes the role and importance of the warring parties in agricultural production. If we take the average figures for the last five seasons, then Russia produced 10%, Ukraine - 3% of the world's wheat. Russia was the world's first exporter of wheat (20% of world exports), Ukraine was the fifth (10% of world exports). Russia and Ukraine produce 20% of the world's barley, are the third and fourth exporters in the world.
2479	16	Ukraine is the world's largest producer of sunflower seeds. Next comes Russia. Together, countries produce more than half of this product in the world. Ukraine is the world's fourth largest exporter of vegetable oil. Ukraine is also the third largest exporter of corn and rapeseed. In addition, Ukraine is the largest exporter of soybeans, except for South and North America.
2479	18	Today, ~4.9 billion hectares of land are used for agricultural production in the world, of which ~1.6 billion are used for cereals. For comparison: in 1950, 3.84 billion hectares were used (for grains there were 1.22 billion).
2479	20	In the world, about half of the land suitable for life (global habitable land) is used for agricultural production: in China - 56%, Russia - 13.2%, Ukraine - 71.3%, Poland - 47.4%, Germany - 47.6 %, Italy - 41.7%, France - 52.3%, Spain - 52.4%, USA - 44.4%, Canada - 6.5%, Brazil - 28.3%, Argentina - 54.4% , Peru - 18.4%, India - 60.4%, Turkey - 49.1%.
2479	22	The decrease in the supply of almost any agricultural raw material, product at the current level of agricultural technology, the availability of unused resources for agricultural production is solely a consequence of government decisions, i.e. stewards of someone else's different countries. The grain yield today is such that, compared with 1961, only 30% of the land is needed to obtain the same volume of production.
2479	24	Unfortunately, first of all, the developed countries continue to work in the regime of strict agrarian protectionism, quotas, tariffs and many non-tariff restrictions.
2479	26	If the market for agricultural products were truly free, then food prices would be many times lower, and residents of poor countries would spend on food not 40-50% of their income, but 10-15%. Therefore, the main tool for eliminating hunger and reducing food prices in the world is the transition from a regime that is beneficial for the agro-barons of all countries to a free market regime.
2479	28	In a free market, households would have $4-6 trillion in hand for manufactured goods and a variety of services. Today, we, consumers, are forced to overpay such huge sums of money for the fact that officials and agrarian barons together impose on us a hundred-year-old agrarian policy.
2482	1	I.N. Mikheev. IF TODAY WE LOSE NOVOROSSIYA, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP EURASIA. Part 1.
2482	3	The statement that Asia is gradually becoming the main center of the world economy and the fate of the world will be decided in Asia in the foreseeable future can be considered a truism. The economies of East, South-East and South Asia, the largest of which: China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, already today provide, taking into account purchasing power parity (PPP), 40% of world GDP. The share of India, for example, in world GDP, taking into account PPP, is 8%. This is more than Germany, England and France combined. They only have 7.5%. The share of China is 20%. Moreover, the GDP of Asian countries is generated in the real sector of the economy, where real material values ​​are created. Whereas a significant part of the GDP of the West arises in a completely ephemeral service sector.
2482	5	The main geopolitical players and all interested parties who expect to remain in the 21st century subjects of world history, and not objects of foreign manipulations and interests, are gradually transferring their assets to Asia. Take, for example, the modern financial Typhon, the largest private bank in the world (its assets amount to $ 4 trillion) - the central banks of most countries of the world are pygmies compared to it, the largest and most global accumulator of financial assets in the world today, with more than 10 thousand assets. offices in 90 countries - Hong Kong-Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). So, HSBC holds twice as many assets in Asia as in the US. Being registered in England, HSBC's main operating centers are located in Asia - to Chinese Guangzhou, in Indian Hyderabad and Pune, in Malaysia and the Philippines. Why I took HSBC, the flagship of the Rothschild financial group, as an example. These people know how to count and know how to calculate ahead. If they go somewhere with their money, there is no doubt that it is there that the main and most interesting events will unfold.
2482	7	"In terms of exports and imports, Russia will also have to gradually reorient itself towards Asian markets. But with what will the Russian Federation come to them? Again with cheap natural gas? With crude oil? With round timber and prostitutes? In the familiar image of ""Upper Volta with rockets""? I doubt that future generations, left bare-assed in the Siberian frosts - without natural resources pumped out of the depths by the current compradors, will thank us for this stupid economic strategy worthy of the Papuans: to exchange gold (non-renewable natural resources) for glass beads."
2482	9	The place of Russia in the world division of labor, in the world commodity exchange should be determined by its real capabilities and resources. Namely, the ability to generate large amounts of energy, reserves of ores rich in useful components and other mineral raw materials. But in order to be a worthy participant in the global commodity exchange, Russia must enter the world markets not directly with metals and minerals, as is the case today, but with energy-intensive, metal-intensive, mineral-intensive and science-intensive high-tech products. These are the products of the chemical industry that uses mineral raw materials, products of mechanical engineering, in particular machine tool building, shipbuilding, aircraft building, rocket building, turbine building, and high-speed ground transport. However, this raises the problem of cost and competitiveness.
2482	11	In small series and in single copies, machines in the broadest sense and machine tools can be produced in different regions. For example, it is quite cost-effective to assemble Soyuz-2 launch vehicles in Samara, where the average annual temperature is +5.6. But for the cost price, therefore, for the competitiveness of products that are assembled on a conveyor, on slipways, energy costs per unit of production, the cost of labor - labor, as well as transportation costs for delivery to the place of production of raw materials and components and delivery of finished products to the consumer are critical.
2482	13	Today there is talk about the creation of industrial centers in Siberia - closer to the Siberian and Ural raw material bases and to the Asian markets. In itself, the idea of ​​developing Siberia and reindustrialization is certainly correct and timely, it can only be welcomed. But here you need to understand that Russia's ability to create industrial clusters, competitive production in the field of mechanical engineering or the chemical industry in Siberia and the Far East is limited by climatic conditions. The main limiters will be the shortage of labor resources and the high cost of creating infrastructure for people's lives. As you know, the fish is looking for where it is deeper, and the person, where the climatic conditions are better. It is no coincidence that the climate factor has the largest share in the calculation of the quality of life index - the quality-of-life index. Not the average income per capita, not the availability of jobs, not security, but the climate. And it is no coincidence that the Russian Federation is in 72nd place in the mentioned index out of 80 accounting countries - noticeably lower than Colombia, Venezuela, El Salvador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, etc.
2482	15	The climate is a natural limiter for the development of the industry. What can we say about Siberia, even if in the Leningrad region with its relatively mild Atlantic-continental winter, interested investors, after studying all aspects of the business, often refuse to place production facilities, invest in fixed assets, because there simply are not enough workers in this territory. The population density of the Leningrad region is 22 people. per sq. km. In order not to experience a shortage of workers and technical engineering personnel, at least 40-50 are needed. The population density of the Khabarovsk Territory is 1.8 people. In the southern regions of the region, where Khabarovsk itself stands, there are 6 people per square meter. km.
2482	17	There are plenty of real-life examples in other countries as well. For example, in Finland, more than 80% of the population lives in the south and southwest of the country, on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and the western part of the Gulf of Finland, heated by the warm Gulf Stream. In the northern and eastern provinces bordering our Karelia, with a temperate continental climate, less than 20% of the population lives on a much larger territory. The government strives to maintain the population of the northern and northeastern provinces, but no benefits can force the Finns to move from the relatively comfortable southwest in terms of climatic conditions to the uncomfortable northeast.
2482	19	In the United States, anyone who wants to settle in the state of Alaska will be able to rent a large comfortable apartment in the center of the state capital, Anchorage, inexpensively. He will also receive a subsidy from the state to pay for the apartment. But the population of Anchorage, where the climate is noticeably milder than in our Khabarovsk, is the average January temperature, due to the influence of the warm Alaska Current, a branch of the North Pacific Current, minus 8.4 degrees, and so, the population of Anchorage is only 280 thousand. And the total population of the state total 730 thousand people. Despite the fact that the population of the United States is 340 million, no one wants to go to Alaska, although salaries are higher there.
2482	21	We see the same in Canada. Nearly 90% of Canadians live in the south of the country - within 100 miles of the US border. In the rest of vast Canada - its area is almost 10 million square meters. km - only 10% of the population lives. The resource-rich north of the country is uninhabited, although wages are noticeably higher there. The population density of the northern province of Nunavut is 0.01 people/sq. km. This province occupies 21% of the territory of Canada, its area is approximately equal to the area of ​​Indonesia - 2 million square meters. km. At the same time, only 40 thousand people live in the entire province of Nunavut, 270 million in Indonesia!
2482	23	The most striking and closest example is the experience of China. In the 90s, in Inner Mongolia - in the north of China, the Chinese found deposits of coal. A coal boom began - many mines were founded. To attract workers to the mines, large and convenient modern cities were built from scratch: Xishuan, Ordos, Kangbashi. Millions (!) of apartments - comparable to the number of apartments in all of Russia (64 million). With all the infrastructure - shopping centers, parks, large luxurious stadiums, museums. The Chinese are not sloppy. So, these cities are still uninhabited. There were no people wishing to go to live in the Ordos steppe and semi-desert, where the climate is continental, blown by cold northern winds. Although the average temperatures here are noticeably higher than in the Urals. January −10°С, July +23°С.
2482	25	The Chinese prefer to live in the south and on the east coast, where the climate is subtropical. It is easy to understand them - life expectancy in the southeastern and southern provinces is almost one and a half times longer than in Inner Mongolia and in the northern provinces. In Macau - the Chinese Las Vegas on the coast of the South China Sea, the population density is 21 thousand (!) People per square meter. km. In the northern and western provinces of China - 20-30 people. - a thousand times less! That's what the climate factor means. As a result, the mentioned new cities of resource-rich Inner Mongolia turned into ghost towns. Only tourists go there - to look at this fantastic sur - deserted megacities, and directors - to shoot science fiction on location.
2482	27	The creation and maintenance of infrastructure for the life of people in Siberia will cost much more than even in central Russia, not to mention the south. This will be a heavy burden on the budget. Attracting labor resources will be even more expensive. It is comfortable to live here for the indigenous peoples of the circumpolar ethnic group. But they are few in number and prefer other types of activity - in closer contact with the natural landscape, to which they have adapted over many centuries, rather than factory and factory work. It will be possible to offer people from other regions to live in an uncomfortable climate and engage in productive labor only by enticing them with a long ruble, which will affect the cost of production and its competitiveness. And most importantly, having accumulated money, people will still leave for warmer climes. Of course, separate industries close to the places of extraction of the raw materials used should be created in Siberia, but building and populating large new cities is a utopia.
2482	29	However, unfavorable climatic conditions, continental geography as a whole, does not at all mean the futility of the development of the industry in Russia.
2482	31	Significant territories of historical Russia are located in the temperate continental climate zone with relatively mild winters - the average January temperature is slightly below zero. The Russians began to actively develop these lands back in the 17th century - under Alexei Mikhailovich, they finally conquered it in the 18th century - under Catherine II. Suvorov, Rumyantsev, Ushakov, Potemkin - put their lives precisely on the reconquest of these lands. These are the basins of the Don and the Northern Donets, the Kuban, the Black Sea region. The historical name of the region is Novorossiya. It includes Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Nikolaev, Odessa regions of present-day Ukraine.
2482	33	Adjacent to Novorossiya and inseparable from it is Slobozhanshchina, with its center in Kharkov. A quarter of a million square kilometers that went after the collapse of the USSR to non-independent Ukrobander Ukraine and almost the same number remained in the Russian Federation.
2482	35	It is natural that the national economic complex of Russia was formed as a united one - the Ural-Siberian raw materials and the Ural and Novorossiysk industrial ones. But unlike the Urals, which has a sharply continental climate, the average January temperature is -13, -15, the average annual is +3, in Novorossia the average January temperature in different regions is from -2 to -5, the average annual is +10, +15. Energy consumption, therefore, the cost of industrial production is much lower. And the shoulder of transportation to the central part of the country and for export by sea is much shorter. Near ice-free Black Sea ports.
2482	37	It is no coincidence that at the end of the 19th century it was here - in the south-west of historical Russia, that our ancestors began to create the Novorossiysk industrial region, in particular the Donetsk-Kryvyi Rih industrial complex, which included the Russian Ruhr - Donbass, industrial centers in suburban Ukraine - in the Kharkiv region, as well as in Yekaterinoslav and in the Black Sea region - Odessa-Nikolaev. This circumstance, obviously, was taken into account by Pyotr Nikolaevich Savitsky, the creator of the concept for the development of the economic complex of Russia - the neighboring continental economy, known as Eurasianism.
2482	39	"Here I note that in the post-Soviet era, the Eurasian theme, or rather, the Eurasian rhetoric, became fashionable. What kind of rubbish is not served with Eurasian sauce. What is only Dugin's, more precisely, Tiriar's (Belgian Jean Thiriart's) idea of ​​""Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" - not just a perversion, but a direct antithesis of Eurasianism. In Kazan, the activists of the TOC, a Tatar organization with an anti-Russian nationalist extremist agenda, invented their own Turkic-Islamic Eurasianism in defiance of the Moscow-imperial one. In the 2000s, open supporters of Wahhabism labored in Niyazov's Eurasian Party in Kazan."
2482	41	"However, no one has a monopoly on the term ""Eurasianism"". Therefore, everyone is free to put any meaning into it - exactly in accordance with the legendary phrase of Peter I, who demanded that his newly minted senators speak at meetings of the Senate ""not according to the written word"", ""so that everyone's foolishness was visible."" But here I mean precisely classical Eurasianism. So, the core of classical Eurasianism is the economic doctrine of Savitsky. Actually, the economic paradigm of the development of the economic complex of Russia by Savitsky is classical Eurasianism. Ethnopsychology N.S. Trubetskoy and the concept of G.V. Vernadsky of the continuity of Russian statehood, Russian imperialism from the Mongol - Genghis Khan, this is just an appendage that gives classical Eurasianism volume, multidimensionality, the necessary integrity and academic respectability."
2482	43	It must be understood that the Slavic-Turkic symbiosis in the expanses of Eurasia arose not at all from the similarity of Slavic and Turkic ornaments, not from the exchange of dictionaries, not from conferences on the topic of Slavic-Turkic friendship and chewing gum, and not even from the predominance of the Slavs and some of the Turks - Turkic-Kipchaks of Y-chromosome haplogroups R1a, I and N1c. This symbiosis arose from the joint economic development of the Eurasian landscapes by the Slavs and the Turks, from the exchange of goods, from the combination of efforts to create an integral Eurasian national economic complex. It was in the process of developing joint economic practices that those ties arose, including cultural ones, that gave rise to the Slavic-Turkic syncret - the Russian superethnos, in Gumilyov's terminology.
2482	45	So, classical Eurasianism is a discourse not at all about the mythical “Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok”, not about the 10,000-kilometer bridge covered with legends between Europe and Asia. and not even about Russia's economic ties with the Central Asian countries that have emerged in the post-Soviet space. Although, of course, such ties need to be restored and developed. More precisely, Eurasianism is not about these connections in the first place. Russia's relations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and even more so with China, are not the essence of Eurasianism, not its core, but only an additional secondary component.
2482	47	Russia, even in its present territorially castrated form, remains Eurasia by itself. It is capable of implementing the Eurasian doctrine even if it has no Central Asian neighbors at all. Moreover, if you add up the GDP of the Central Asian states - members of the EAEU, then the entire gross amount will add less than 15% to the Russian GDP. That is, a new quality from the addition of the GDP of Russia and the Central Asian neighbors will not work in any way. But that's not the point. And that in the total volume, for example, of Kazakhstani exports, oil, gas and metals in value terms account for 90%. And Kazakhstan drives this raw material for processing not to Russia, but to China and Europe.
2482	49	However, Kazakhstan, no less ethno-Nazi than Ukraine, to which the great strategist Stalin, like a fur coat from a master's shoulder, presented southern Russian Siberia with all its riches, does not even export its raw materials, but only watches how Western and Chinese concessionaires do it . Nearly a hundred copper deposits, fifty zinc deposits, fifty lead, two dozen bauxites, rich hydrocarbon deposits, and facilities for the extraction of oil, gas, ores and the smelting of non-ferrous metal created in the USSR are now owned by Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni, Chinese CNPC. Actually, it was for this that the collapse of the USSR was carried out. It was to Western and Chinese corporations that the fake Eurasian Nazarbayev, a rare scoundrel, hastened to transfer all the natural resources of sovereign Kazakhstan on the second day after the liquidation of the USSR.
2482	51	At the forums and in the EAEU commissions, Kazakh representatives with a smart look talk about Eurasian integration, about uniform tariffs and technical regulations, and all the deposits explored by Russian geologists, all the goks and smelters built by Russian engineers and workers, on which Russians are mainly in Soviet times and worked, sovereign Kazakhstan gave, I repeat, to the Americans and the Chinese. Such hypocrisy, such meanness to look for. The mutual trade turnover between Russia and Kazakhstan is so small that if you look at the numbers, you get the impression that Russia and Kazakhstan are not the main participants in the common economic union - the EAEU, but are completely different. In Russia's foreign trade turnover in 2020, the share of Kazakhstan amounted to a little more than 3%, and in all previous years it was completely less than 3%! Well, who do we want to deceive with such ersatz-Eurasianism? Themselves?
2482	53	"So, the essence of Savitsky's classical Eurasianism lies not in the false friendship between Russia and its Central Asian neighbors, not in the supply of labor from Tajikistan to Moscow construction sites so that developers with a residence permit in Israel and the United States consistently receive their superprofits, and even more so the essence of classical Eurasianism not in ""Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" - this is exactly what Eurasianism firmly and resolutely denies, but in the creation of a neighboring continental economy. The content of this is in inter-regional and inter-regional production cooperation within Russia, in inter-regional and inter-regional commodity exchange. Savitsky justified this need by the weak competitiveness of Russian goods in the world commodity markets due to increased transport costs. For my part, I would add that an even more important factor in terms of reducing the competitiveness of Russian goods is high energy costs due to the sharply continental climate. A. Parshev brilliantly wrote about this in the well-known book Why Russia is not America."
2482	55	In this regard, interregional and interregional cooperation and commodity exchange become possible only when the customs borders for the export of Russian raw materials and the import of finished products are covered, if not tightly, but in such a way that mineral raw materials, minerals, which Russia is rich in, are processed and the final high-tech the product was produced domestically. At the same time, I will add, for my part, it is logical that raw materials mined in regions with a cold, sharply continental climate go to a region where more favorable climatic conditions make it possible to reduce energy costs per unit of production, hence its cost, and produce competitive products, which, the domestic market will prefer imports, and which can be supplied to foreign markets.
2482	57	In other words, the neighborhood economy is a semi-autarkic economy. It would seem that it could be simpler and more banal - even Mendeleev spoke about this. But Savitsky has not just words, he proved with numbers and calculations in his hands that there is no alternative to the neighboring economy. Either a continental neighboring economy with half-hidden customs, or Russia is turning into a raw-material colony of more successful economies that have a priori geographical advantages over the Russian one. Let me note that Savitsky's autarchy and covered customs do not mean at all that if we live in the north, we should eat exclusively turnips, rutabaga and white cabbage, and fundamentally refuse bananas and watermelons. They only mean that we must grow our own watermelons - in Astrakhan. And not to import them by ship from West African Mali, as is the case today.
2482	59	Savitsky himself, after serving 11 years - from 1945 to 1956. in camps and prisons, died in exile, but his concept was implemented in the USSR. In the USSR, in the 20th century, it was precisely the continental neighboring economy that was created. It would seem a paradox: the main theoretician of Eurasianism is sitting in Stalin's camps, while his economic program is being fully implemented in the country, and Stalin is the main Eurasian practitioner. Of course, in terms of institutional relations, in the sense of property relations, the economy of the USSR was far from the ideals of Eurasianism. Savitsky did not at all propose to de-peasant the country - to take away land from small commodity producers, turn them into powerless slaves without passports and establish collective farms, to which the wise district committees of the party will indicate when to sow and when to reap. But here are the key macroeconomic principles of the organization of the national economy - its structure, its balance sheets, its differentiation, that is, division according to the sectoral and territorial principle, its inter-sectoral and inter-regional ties and, most importantly, its ultimate goal - the preservation of the country's economic sovereignty in the USSR were precisely Eurasian.
2482	61	However, there is no paradox here. The fact is that both Savitsky's economic theory and Stalin's economic practice reflected objective reality - its inexorable circumstances. Savitsky comprehensively studied them, comprehended, rationalized and objectified in the form of a scientific paradigm. Stalin grasped them intuitively and used them in practice. It was not at all Stalin’s voluntarism and ideological chimeras, but objective geographical and economic reasons that determined the semi-autarkic nature of the development of the national economy in the USSR with a focus on the domestic market and the market of neighboring continental countries, in spite of the openness of the global economy, which 30 years has been imposing on the world, Russia in particular, West and homegrown Russian compradors.
2482	63	". After the development of the oil and gas fields of Siberia in the Soviet era, its resources were not transported to the West and China, as they are today, but were connected with the industrial potential of the southern regions of historical Russia, which, after the collapse of the USSR, began to misunderstand to be called the ""East of Ukraine"", but the authentic primordial whose name is Novorossiya. It was as a result of such a connection that the real Eurasian Union - the USSR became the second economy in the world. The USSR economy accounted for 20% (!) of world industrial production. About as much as China has today. Moreover, the volume of foreign trade of the USSR in the late 80s was less than 7% percent of its GDP."
2482	65	In the 90s, the new elite was a bunch of small (in essence, but not on the scale of the stolen), mostly Moscow gesheftmachers, in a hurry to plunder natural resources and line their pockets, infantile enthusiasts of the free global market and conscious pests from the fifth column, who called themselves reformers, the continental neighbor the economy that gave birth to the grandiose Soviet industry was completely destroyed. Acting under the guidance of their Washington and Brussels curators, they began to play by someone else's rules - the rules of the Western financial oligarchy that controls global exchange. And very soon -
2482	67	in just a few years, they turned Russia into a raw materials colony of the European Union.
2482	69	Now also China. When you look at the shameless advertising of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, through which natural gas is driven to China, a completely different lexeme comes to mind: the power of stupidity and greed.
2482	71	Here, by the way, the prophetic genius of Savitsky manifested itself once again. Savitsky warned back in the 20s of the last century that if Russia integrates into the global economy created by the West without taking into account the geographical position that lowers the competitiveness of its goods, it will very quickly lose financial sovereignty and become financially dependent on more economically developed countries. And in economic terms, it will turn into a raw material colony - into a country of monoculture. That is, it will supply the world commodity markets with that monoculture, which is especially rich and which the masters of the global economy will prescribe for it.
2482	73	For my part, I note that this circumstance means at least a partial loss of political sovereignty. The fact is that the country of monoculture, firstly, is entirely dependent on counterparties - buyers of the monoculture produced by it - which these counterparties can use to exert political pressure. Secondly, the focus on monoculture causes a weak differentiation of the country's economy, and this automatically leads to dependence on imports of critically important goods - food, etc. exchange Western oligarchy prices.
2482	75	At that time, the oil and gas fields of Siberia had not yet been explored. But Savitsky looked into the water. A century later, American wits pejoratively call Russia a gas station. McCain is a gas station disguised as a country, Biden is a gas station with nuclear missiles. And they have quite convincing reasons for such witticisms - just look at the structure of Russian exports. Hydrocarbons have become a monoculture for Russia.
2482	77	In 2021, gas was sold to Europe under the notorious long-term contracts at two hundred dollars per thousand cubic meters, while the market price in Europe and Asia is more than a thousand dollars, and even reached 2 thousand. That is, they gave it as a gift. Is it possible to imagine that Germany, with a market value of 60 thousand euros for Mercedes, supplies them to Russia for 10 thousand? Moreover, under long-term contracts. Under the pretext of preserving the Russian market and with loud assurances that she, Germany, is a reliable supplier of Mercedes to Russia at a price ten times lower than the market price at all times.
2482	79	Everything, as Savitsky promised, is that the country of monoculture is forced to give away its natural resources, in fact, for next to nothing. Although there is a dime a dozen speculations about Eurasianism today, never in history has Russia been so far from the Eurasian ideal, Eurasian goals and objectives, as it is today. We are not even a gas station - in terms of the production of high-octane gasoline, we are far from among the world leaders - we are just two large parallel pipes - oil and gas. Suffice it to recall that the depth of oil refining in Russia is less than in Africa - where to go further. This is what it means to give away natural resources to compradors, both private sharashkas like Lukoil and state compradors like Rosneft.
2482	81	"However, the beginning of this degradation from a superpower to a gas station was laid under Brezhnev. And it was connected with the famous project ""gas in exchange for pipes."" Then the rapidly bourgeois elite of the USSR discovered that it was much easier and more pleasant to pump oil and gas to Europe, to Germany, receiving hard currency and buying fashionable consumer goods for it in the same Europe, than to engage in painstaking Egyptian work to develop and tune the mechanism of the country's economic complex. Sit on the pipe - dangle your feet. But as our observant ancestors also noticed: the claw is stuck, the whole bird is abyss. In 1991, the bird named USSR eventually disappeared. This is what gas turned out to be in exchange for gum and Pepsi-Cola. And all because the comprador economy, based on the export of raw materials, has as a consequence not only the deprivation of the resources of future generations. Another evil that the comprador economy generates is that it corrupts the ruling class and lumpenizes the population, which, without a developed industrial infrastructure, without jobs in the sphere of productive labor, is out of work and is rapidly degrading in all literally respects."
2482	83	However, the political situation and the stupidity of the elites can in no way cancel geography and geophysics. And it cannot cancel purely economic reasons. In order to remain competitive, the production of serial products of mechanical engineering, machine tool building and more widely, of any mass product, must be located in regions with a favorable climate that causes low energy costs per unit of output, with a short arm for the most economical - sea transportation of raw materials, components, finished products and with sufficient labor resources. There is only one such region in historical Russia - Novorossiya.
2482	85	Novorossiya is a unique region. Both climatically and geographically - non-freezing ports are located at a small distance. For two centuries, our ancestors created a developed industrial infrastructure here. GDP in the era of the USSR was created here not due to the plundering of mineral resources and the sale of raw materials to Europe and China, but due to productive labor and the creation of added value. Per capita GDP in Novorossiya has always been higher than in other regions of historical Russia. At the same time, GDP was created in the real sector, and not in the service sector and financial speculation - as in Moscow, which profits from the fact that it resells money bought from European banks on the expensive Russian credit market. Novorossians worked in mines, at blast furnaces and at machine tools, they produced real material values. Novorossiya has always been the locomotive of both the Russian imperial and Soviet economies.
2482	87	Let's take Dnepropetrovsk, now the Dnieper region, as an example. Yekaterinoslav - the true name of the city - was founded under Catherine the Great by Potemkin as the southern capital of Russia. Not Kyiv was planned as the southern capital, but the Novorossiysk Yekaterinoslav. And it is by no means accidental. There is a rare variety of mineral deposits here. To date, 302 explored deposits. 40 types of mineral raw materials are mined. Iron ore reserves are 15 billion tons - the volume of production before Maidan is 87 million per year. manganese ores. Talco-magnesite. The kaolin deposit is the best in the world in terms of reserves and quality of raw materials. The balance reserves of hard and brown coal are 21 billion tons. Gold, molybdenum, tungsten, uranium, and rare earth metals have been explored. And this richest raw material base is supplemented by the powerful industrial potential created by our grandfathers: 587 industrial enterprises in 15 industries, including gold mining, 950 ore occurrences, a mining and metallurgical complex of 57 enterprises, 3 coking plants, a ferroalloy plant. 4 pipe factories - produce 40 thousand pipe sizes from 400 steel grades, pipes made of brass, aluminum, titanium, zirconium. Export to 40 countries. Power industry: Prydniprovska and Krivoy Rog thermal power plants with a total capacity of 4.7 thousand MW, Dneprodzerzhinsk (now Kamenskaya) hydroelectric power station. Nature: 15 deposits of mineral waters, formed on the watersheds of the soil of the chernozem type. All types of agricultural crops are grown.
2482	89	This is only one of the 7 regions of Novorossia, now in the hands of the Ukrobanderites. None of the Russian regions up to the Urals can be compared with it in terms of wealth of minerals, minerals and, at the same time, industrial potential. Yuzhmash alone is worth something - it produced the entire line of missiles in the USSR, ranging from tactical to space, including intercontinental ballistic ones.
2482	91	And in quantities more than providing parity with the US and NATO. And let's say, Slobozhanshchina, adjacent to Novorossia, with its center in Kharkov, occupied the first places in many types of industrial products both in pre-revolutionary Russia and in the USSR. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were already over 900 industrial enterprises. The largest ones are in metalworking and transport engineering. In the USSR, Kharkov was the country's largest center of tractor, tank and turbine building. And at the same time the largest transport hub.
2482	93	It is also important that the South of historical Russia is not only its industrial center, but also its scientific and technological center. Here, new technologies were generated on their own scientific and technological base in the Soviet period. Kharkov, for example, in the USSR was the 3rd largest R&D center after Moscow and Leningrad
2482	95	And what is the Nikolaevsky shipbuilding plant worth! In the USSR, he built the entire line of ships - both civilian, including large tankers and bulk carriers, and military, including aircraft carriers. Thanks to the Novorossiysk shipbuilders, the USSR had a serious aircraft carrier fleet - 5 aircraft carriers in service and two under construction. Today there is, in fact, none. Even modern BDK - landing ships in the Russian Navy is in short supply. Those that are in service were built in the 60s of the last century. As a result, even a local operation to occupy one unfortunate Odessa is delayed - there are not enough technical means to ensure hostilities.
2492	3	BEIJING, July 8 - RIA Novosti. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced his upcoming resignation the day before, served the interests of the United States often to the detriment of the interests of the British people, he actually destroyed London's relations with China and Russia, his departure is favorable for everyone, Gao Zhikai, a professor at Suzhou University, told RIA Novosti on Friday.
2492	4	Boris Johnson, who succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in 2019, announced on Thursday that he is stepping down as prime minister and head of the UK's Conservative Party, and will remain in office until a new prime minister is appointed. At the same time, there are calls from different sides that he should already leave his post.
2492	6	In the past two-plus years, Johnson has ignored the national interests of Britain, completely abandoned an independent foreign policy and was ready to voluntarily become a lackey of the United States, sacrificing London's independent foreign policy and the ability to make decisions independently. From this point of view, this (Johnson's departure from the post of prime minister - ed.) is good for the UK itself, for China, Russia and the EU, it is good even for world peace, - said Gao Zhikai.
2492	8	He noted that, for example, after the start of a special military operation in Ukraine, Johnson consistently adhered to extremely harsh anti-Russian rhetoric, shouted about the need for military action and the continuous escalation of the conflict, and also called for the destruction and split of Russia.
2492	10	"The analyst added that Johnson had recently visited Ukraine twice, and at that time he was worried about various internal problems, and the crisis inside the UK was already quite serious, “he tried to use the conflict in Ukraine to make himself a defender of Ukraine, to divert attention from problems in his own country."""
2492	11	In other words, he is not really concerned about the life and death of the inhabitants of Ukraine, not the stability of Ukraine, not how to resolve the conflict in Ukraine peacefully, but only his personal interests, - added Gao Zhikai.
2492	13	"Speaking about Johnson's role in the development of relations between Britain and China, Gao Zhikai said that ""Johnson sold his soul and body to the United States, he was ready to serve as Washington's bouncer and provoke China to the extreme on many issues, especially Taiwan, as a result of which relations freezing point between Beijing and London."""
2492	14	He added that Johnson had effectively destroyed Britain's diplomatic relations with Russia and China, and all of his actions are completely contrary to the fundamental interests of the British people.
2492	15	Going forward, the analyst pointed out, everything depends on whether the new British prime minister can put the interests of the British people first instead of defending the interests of the United States, following Washington and being his henchman.
2492	17	The next Prime Minister of Great Britain has an extremely difficult task, because now the country is experiencing inflation, energy shortages and a serious financial crisis. From this point of view, they must begin to act as quickly as possible, and most importantly, to improve relations with Russia. Because without Russia there can be no lasting peace either in Europe or in the world, he believes.
2494	1	In the United States, Kyiv's statements about an imminent victory were called fiction
2494	3	MOSCOW, July 8/ Radio Sputnik. Statements by Ukrainian leaders about an imminent victory in the confrontation with Russia are increasingly looking like science fiction, says columnist for the American Foreign Affairs magazine Barry Posen.
2494	4	The author noted that the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict.
2494	5	"However, the Russian army is too strong to allow Kyiv ""to negate its achievements in the Donbass,"" the journalist is sure. He also stressed that Europeans and Americans, suffering from the consequences of anti-Russian sanctions, may run out of patience. Against this background, Western support will become ""less generous,"" Posen said."
2494	7	As a result, the West will be forced to agree to the easing of restrictions, and NATO will have to start negotiations with Russia aimed at finding ways to de-escalate, Posen concluded.
2495	3	"Volodymyr Zelensky's statement that the conflict in Ukraine ""will end before the end of the year"" if powerful weapons from partners ""arrive on time,"" political analyst Yuriy Kot commented on Sputnik radio."
2495	5	"Volodymyr Zelensky, in an interview with CNN, again called on Western countries to help Kyiv with weapons. According to Zelensky, the ""military part"" of the conflict with Russia can be ""stopped before the end of this year"" if ""powerful weapons from our partners come to us in time."""
2495	7	On the air of Sputnik radio, political scientist, Dean of the Faculty of Media Communications of the Moscow State Institute of Cinematography Yuriy Kot expressed the opinion that Zelensky is trying to cheer up his partners in the West.
2495	9	<<Zelensky is trying to cheer up his partners, who have clearly begun to turn sour, tired of this whole story, especially since Ukraine has no obvious successes at the front. On the one hand, he tries to build a Brave tailor out of himself, on the other hand, everyone can see perfectly well that his eyes are sad - with such eyes, as they say, you can’t sell an elephant. Therefore, in my opinion, there is no point in taking these words seriously. Especially after the collapse event for Kyiv - the departure of Zelensky's personal patron and all the Russophobic evil spirits in Ukraine, Boris Johnson, from the post of British Prime Minister. Until there is a new prime minister, a lot of time will pass. In addition, there are more and more voices in Europe about why to support Ukraine, all this is pointless>>, said Yuriy Kot.
2495	11	According to him, Europe is trying to encourage Zelensky to negotiate.
2495	13	<<To ensure that he sat down at the negotiating table and negotiated. There are voices that Ukraine cannot avoid the loss of territories, and it is better to agree now, while a small part is lost. Zelensky hopes that there will be more weapons so that by the fall they can come out with some victories and sit down at the negotiating table not to sign a surrender, but sort of like a strong side. But all these are insinuations, there is nothing serious behind this>>, the political scientist believes.
2496	1	Peskov: Russia does not use gas and oil as a political weapon
2496	3	MOSCOW, July 8/ Radio Sputnik. Russia denies accusations of using gas as a weapon of political pressure and is capable of guaranteeing the complete energy security of Europe, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
2496	5	<<We completely reject any hints or direct statements that the Russian side is using gas or oil as a weapon of political pressure. This is not true. Russia is consistently fulfilling all its obligations, and Russia is still able to guarantee the full energy security of Europe. And Russia is able to guarantee the absence of sky-high bills for electricity and heat, which taxpayers in European countries are now receiving>>, RIA Novosti quotes Peskov.
2496	7	He also commented on the statement by President Vladimir Putin about the incommensurability of the potentials of Russia and Ukraine, which he made the day before at a meeting with the leaders of the State Duma factions.
2496	9	<<No, I will not send you to the Ministry of Defense this time. These are indeed the words of the head of state. But the head of state just operated on those statements that are heard from Western countries, from Kyiv that, they say, Kyiv will move on the battlefield until victory. But here again, Putin thus simply reminded that the potentials are completely incommensurable, and Russia's potential is so great in this regard that only an insignificant part of it is now being used in the course of a special military operation. And that is why all these statements of Westerners are literally absurd, they are absurd, and they simply add grief to the Ukrainian people. What President Putin also said yesterday>>,” Peskov said.
2498	3	Ukraine may disappear from the world map if you continue to supply it with weapons, former adviser to the US Secretary of Defense Colonel Douglas McGregor said on Sky News Australia.
2498	5	He criticized the military assistance to Kyiv from the countries of the collective West, in particular Australia, and stressed that they should have contributed to a peaceful resolution of the situation, otherwise Ukraine would face destruction and death.
2498	7	“This is already, in principle, a failed state, it can completely disappear from the world map. I think a ceasefire is needed. Australia should push for it, because no one in Washington will go for it. But from people in Berlin, Paris and London, I hear of growing support for just this one idea - a ceasefire - and coming to some kind of agreement. Because we cannot afford to fight to the last Ukrainian,” McGregor explained.
2498	9	Earlier it became known that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised to provide Ukraine with 14 armored personnel carriers, 20 Bushmaster armored vehicles and several drones. Interestingly, Australia stands out for something here, that McGregor focuses on it?
2498	11	But the most interesting thing here, of course, is the position of the United States. Are they ready to accept not only the defeat of Ukraine (some American experts and politicians are already talking about this with might and main), but also the liquidation of its statehood? Or is it a private opinion?
2498	13	Maybe in the US they began to suspect something?
2498	15	“This American military expert has become a real star of the Russian social and political media in recent months,” says political scientist, head of the Open Analytics project Roman Travin.
2498	17	- He often comes out with sharp criticism of the actions of the United States in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government itself and the army, gives pessimistic forecasts for Washington, Brussels and Kyiv on the development of the conflict, both in its current format and in the event of its significant expansion. That is, he did not suddenly, under the influence of some new input, change his mind about what was happening, but initially he assessed the situation approximately in this vein.
2498	19	"""SP"": - On behalf of whom does this McGregor speak? Is there a conditional peace party in the USA or is it a private opinion?"
2498	21	- Today there is no really influential peace party in the USA. Rather, on the contrary, there is a consensus in the political establishment of the country regarding the need to confront Russia. So this is rather a private opinion, but it is clear that there are other experts and individual politicians who have a similar opinion. But in the modern United States, this is almost a marginal position, at least in the public sphere.
2498	23	"""SP"": - The expert criticized Western countries and, in particular, Australia for military assistance to Kyiv and stressed that they should have contributed to a peaceful resolution of the situation, otherwise Ukraine would face destruction and death. Does Australia stand out in any way?"
2498	25	- It's just that he spoke in the Australian media, it is quite logical that he spoke about this country. And so nothing stands out, Australia acts within the framework of the course common to the entire West.
2498	27	"""SP"": - According to McGregor, Ukraine is already in principle a failed state, it can completely disappear from the world map."
2498	29	- The very term “failed state” or “failed state” can be interpreted quite broadly. For example, which state can be considered failed? Which has already completely degraded and cannot perform its functions, or which is just beginning to lose the main features of the state, such as a monopoly on the legal use of violence? If we focus on the second approach, then since 2014, Ukraine can be described as a failed state.
2498	31	If at first, then even now Ukraine is only on the verge of becoming a failed state. But, in my opinion, irreversible changes took place already in 2014, which left very few chances for the existence of a single full-fledged state on the territory of the former Ukrainian SSR.
2498	33	"""SP"": - In the United States, in your opinion, are they already ready to accept the fact that Ukraine will disappear? In what way would they agree to this?"
2498	35	- The fact that Ukraine will disappear from the world map is not a fact, but one of the many scenarios of a possible development of events. Officially, the Americans can agree with this only in the event of some very serious geopolitical cataclysms, much larger than the Ukrainian crisis. And to accept reality, if things turn out in this way, they will be forced.
2498	37	“This is just the opinion of a private person, said in an optional interview,” agrees American political scientist Vladimir Mozhegov.
2498	39	- At the same time, we can say that it reflects the train of thought of many unbiased experts in the West. That's what's interesting.
2498	41	"""SP"": - Is it all about the supply of weapons? If they are stopped, will Ukraine survive? What do they depend on?"
2498	43	- From this phrase, taken out of context, it can be assumed that McGregor wanted to say the following: the supply of weapons leads to the continuation of hostilities. And their continuation will lead to sad consequences for Ukraine.
2498	45	Arms deliveries depend on the plans of the US, Britain and global elites. In these plans, Ukraine does not figure at all as a subject. I think even continental Europe appears weakly.
2498	47	There are interests of the United States and Britain on the one hand and China and Russia on the other. Well, and the interests of global financiers who firmly hold the testicles of the American and British political elites.
2498	49	"""SP"": - In your opinion, the United States can agree with the disappearance of Ukrainian statehood?"
2498	51	- Ukraine here, I repeat, has nothing to do with it at all. Ukraine is needed only to eliminate the military (primarily nuclear) threat to Russia. For the sake of this, Ukraine will be fed without hesitation. And after that, just as without hesitation, they will feed continental Europe. I am afraid that from the point of view of global financial elites, the United States itself may turn out to be an equally insignificant asset, which may just as well be doomed to be eaten up in the fight against China. Global financial elites are only interested in global power. But these elites are mobile and they can exercise their power from anywhere on the planet.
