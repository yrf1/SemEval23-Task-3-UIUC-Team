221	1	US spread fake stories to escalate Russia
221	3	The geniuses (not) in the National Security Council want to goad Russia into direct attacks on US forces or interests. This would provide the US with an excuse to further escalate the war in Ukraine into open confrontation. It would also divert attention from domestic issues. To achieve this, the NSC has circulated a number of stories in the media claiming that alleged Ukrainian successes are based on US intelligence information.
221	5	WASHINGTON - The United States has provided information about Russian forces that have enabled Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who fell in the Ukraine war, senior American officials said. The targeted aid is part of the Biden administration's covert effort to provide Ukraine with real-time battlefield intelligence. That information includes projected Russian troop movements, gleaned from the latest American assessments of Moscow's secret battle plan for fighting in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region, officials said. Officials declined to say how many generals were killed as a result of US help were killed. The United States has focused on providing the location and other details of the Russian military's mobile headquarters, which change locations frequently. Ukrainian officials combined this geographic information with their own intelligence — including intercepted communications alerting the Ukrainian military to the presence of senior Russian officers — to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that killed Russian officers.
2210	1	Putin's mistake
2210	3	"Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is the most demonized person in the western world since Osama bin Laden and Adolf Hitler. Hillary Clinton says Putin is ""the new Hitler"". US President Biden says Putin is too bad to stay in office."
2210	5	Despite these harsh characterizations of the Russian leader, the Kremlin has only recently abandoned peace negotiations with the West and with the Western puppet in Ukraine. Indeed, it is unclear whether the Kremlin has already read the signs of the times. Atlantic integrationists are still active in Russia and are still willing to give up Russian sovereignty for integration with the West. Putin seems unable or unwilling to get rid of those Russians who restrict Russian foreign and economic policy in the interest of the West.
2210	7	Putin's mistake is that he is an American university liberal from 1950, a believer in international law, mutual respect and cooperation, solving conflicts through diplomacy. Putin and Russia are in trouble because Putin continues to believe in moral behavior, while the West has made it clear that the only value is US hegemony.
2210	9	If Putin really were the new Hitler, there would be no Ukraine, no Europe and probably no USA either.
2210	11	Putin's history of accepting Western provocations prevented Armageddon and got us there at the same time. The Kremlin's extraordinary slowness to recognize a threat and act on it has taught Washington and its puppets that Russia knows no red lines.
2210	13	As a result, many boundaries have been crossed. Russia complains but does little or nothing. The result is that the West dismisses Russian warnings of nuclear war as mere bluster.
2210	15	The West no longer takes Russia seriously. Even small, militarily powerless states do not hesitate to insult and provoke Russia.
2210	17	The limited, slow-moving Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine has allowed the entire West to meddle in the war, sending arms to Ukraine, providing Ukraine with intelligence for attacks on Russian forces, cooperating with Washington sanctions, and the war narrative controlled in the interests of Ukraine. There can be no doubt that the US and NATO are involved in the war against Russia.
2210	19	Despite warnings, Russia continues to ignore this fact militarily. How long can this go on?
2210	21	We face the threat of nuclear war, not because of Russian aggression, but because of the limited and weak Russian response to extreme provocations. The West has learned from Putin's old-fashioned liberalism that Russia is weak and can be bypassed.
2210	23	This conclusion will lead to nuclear war unless the Russians surrender to the West and become another puppet like Germany, France and Britain.
22100	1	Boris, you're fired!
22100	3	The performance is over, the clown leaves the stage. Boris Johnson announced on Thursday morning that he intends to step down as leader of the Conservative Party with immediate effect. As Prime Minister of Great Britain he wants to remain in office until the beginning of October in order to ensure that his successor is settled. The former was welcomed across party lines, the latter caused irritation. Numerous voices from Johnson's own party are calling for the immediate resignation of the prime minister as well. Among other things, various strikes have been announced for the island until autumn, so many politicians do not think that an incapacitated government would be an advantage.
22100	5	With the resignation of Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and Health Minister Sajid Javid on Tuesday evening, the air around Johnson had become thinner almost every minute. By Thursday morning, 50 members of the government, including numerous ministers and parliamentary private secretaries, had resigned. There was hardly any government left. In the end, Finance Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who had just been installed, seems to have been the decisive factor. This was reported on Thursday by numerous media, including the Financial Times and the Guardian.
22100	7	In a brief speech outside 10 Downing Street at lunchtime, Johnson said the 1922 Committee, which represents the interests of the Conservative House of Commons, would announce the timetable for the new party leader election next Monday evening. In his speech, Johnson described the calls for his party friends to resign over the past few days as “eccentric”. To the end, the prime minister insisted that the mass resignations from his government were no reason for his own resignation, after all the Tories had a majority of more than 80 seats in parliament.
22100	9	"It is precisely this majority that the Conservatives want to defend. In the end, however, the majority of them no longer believed that they could do this with a Prime Minister Johnson. Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss, actually considered loyal to the prime minister, wrote on Twitter in response to Johnson's resignation speech: ""The prime minister made the right decision, now we need calm and unity."""
22100	11	With inflation at more than 11 percent, the editor-in-chief of the Financial Times echoed the prevailing sentiment in Britain's middle-class camp in an editorial published on Thursday: Johnson's resignation was long overdue. Too often and too obviously he lied to the country and let other politicians lie for him. Now it needs a successor with “integrity and respect for rules”. Unfortunately, many possible successors would only insufficiently meet these criteria.
22100	13	According to a brief analysis by the anti-militarist think tank Forces Watch on July 7, a remarkable number of possible successors have a military background. Armament policy agitators and current Secretary of Defense Ben Wallace are among the favorites to succeed Johnson.

22101	1	Sanctions: Russia wins the economic war
22101	3	It has now been three months since the West launched its economic war against Russia. But things don't go according to plan - actually quite badly.
22101	5	The sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin were not imposed because they were thought to be best, but because they were better than the other two options available: do nothing or intervene militarily.
22101	7	The first package of economic measures was passed right after the Russian invasion, when it was expected that Ukraine would capitulate within days. This did not happen and resulted in the sanctions – which are not yet complete – being tightened further and further.
22101	9	However, there is currently no sign that Russia is withdrawing from Ukraine. This is hardly surprising given that the sanctions have the perverse effect of driving up the cost of Russia's oil and gas exports, massively bolstering its trade balance and funding its war effort. In the first four months of this year, Putin was able to post a current account surplus of $96 billion (€90.7 billion) - more than triple the same period in 2021.
22101	11	Oil prices are rising – the Kremlin is benefiting
22101	13	When the EU announced its embargo on parts of Russian oil exports at the end of May, the price of crude oil rose on global markets, giving the Kremlin another financial advantage. Meanwhile, Russia has no trouble finding alternative markets for its energy. Oil and gas exports to China in April, for example, are increasing by more than 50 percent annually.
22101	15	But that doesn't mean the sanctions will pass Russia painlessly. According to the International Monetary Fund, the country's economy will shrink by 8.5 percent this year as imports from the West have collapsed. Russia has a stockpile of essential goods to keep the economy running, but eventually they will run out.
22101	17	As Europe gradually frees itself from its dependence on Russian energy, Putin is spared an immediate financial crisis. Indeed, thanks to capital controls and a solid trade surplus, the ruble is strong. Moscow therefore has time to find alternative sources of supply for replacement parts and components from countries willing to circumvent Western sanctions.
22101	19	When global leaders convened in Davos recently, the public message was one of condemnation of Russian aggression and reaffirmation of standing firmly behind Ukraine. On the other hand, there was no public concern about the economic costs of a prolonged war.
22101	21	This concern is fully justified. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to the already strong price pressure. Annual inflation in the UK is 9 percent, the highest in 40 years. In Germany, the Bundesbank expects an inflation rate of 7.1 percent for 2022. Fuel prices have reached a record high.
22101	23	The consequences are stagflation and starvation
22101	25	As a result of the war, Western economies are facing low or negative growth and rising inflation - a return to the stagflation of the 1970s. Meanwhile, central banks - including the Bank of England - are feeling pressure to respond to near-double-digit inflation by raising interest rates. This threatens to increase unemployment. Other European countries face the same problems, perhaps even more so than Britain, as most are comparatively more dependent on Russian gas.
22101	27	Meanwhile, the world's poorer countries face problems on a much larger scale. For some of them, the issue is not stagflation, but starvation - a consequence of the Russian blockade of wheat shipments from Ukraine's Black Sea ports.
22101	29	As World Food Program Director David Beasley put it: “Ukraine's grain elevators are full. At the same time, 44 million people around the world are on the verge of starvation.”
22101	31	In all multilateral organizations - be it the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization or the United Nations - there is a growing fear that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent. The math is simple: unless developing countries are energy exporters themselves, they face a triple problem, with fuel and food crises triggering financial crises. When governments have to choose between feeding their people or servicing their debts to international creditors, they will do the former. Sri Lanka was the first country to default on its debts since the Russian invasion, but it likely won't be the last. The world has not been this close to a full-blown debt crisis since the 1990s.
22101	33	Vladimir Putin has played the long hand from the start
22101	35	"Putin has rightly been criticized for ""weaponizing"" food. However, his willingness to do so should come as no surprise. From the outset, the Russian president played it safe, waiting for the international coalition to split against him. The Kremlin is convinced that Russia's economic pain point is higher than that of the West. And that's probably right."
22101	37	If you need proof that the sanctions aren't working, then US President Joe Biden's decision to equip Ukraine with modern missile systems provides it. The hope is that modern US military technology can do what energy embargoes and Russian asset freezes have failed to do: force Putin to withdraw his troops.
22101	39	One way the war could end is with Ukraine's all-out military victory over Russia. However, given the current state of affairs, that is not very likely. It is also conceivable that the economic blockade will ultimately work, with ever stricter sanctions forcing Russia to give way. Another solution is a negotiated settlement.
22101	41	Putin will not give up unconditionally, and the potential for severe collateral damage from economic warfare is evident: declining living standards in developed countries; Hunger, food riots and a debt crisis in the developing world.
22101	43	The atrocities perpetrated by Russian troops are currently making compromises with the Kremlin a difficult pill to swallow, but economic reality suggests only one thing: sooner or later there will be a negotiated solution.
22102	1	If we fall, it's your turn
22102	3	Several German intellectuals recently called for a stop to Western arms deliveries to Ukraine. This is not only cynical, but also corresponds to Putin's calculations.
22102	5	Last week, a number of German intellectuals in the ZEIT and on ZEIT ONLINE called for a stop to Western arms deliveries to Ukraine and for the immediate end of the war through negotiations. In his response to this appeal, the Ukrainian publicist and psychoanalyst Jurko Prochasko considers these demands to be cynical. It would ultimately mean the disappearance of Ukraine.
22102	7	It's amazing how many formulations there are for a few simple - and simply wrong - thoughts in the context of the Ukraine war. And how often these are put forward again and again by different sides. They read something like: The Ukraine war now requires negotiations, not combat operations. Or: Deliveries of arms only contribute to the continuation, even to the escalation, of this war and therefore demand unnecessary victims. So they increase suffering instead of alleviating it.
22102	9	Such appeals suffer from two fundamental weaknesses. First, the inability to think things through to the end, and second, the tendency to add things that don't exist. The former is called intellectual myopia, the latter wishful thinking. Together they have a journalistic effect, but not the desired effect. Finally, there is also a third feature of such appeals: Precisely where the content would be decisive, i.e. at those points that would justify the writing of such open letters, there of all things there is a slippage into the approximate.
22102	11	This stems from the aforementioned inability to think things through to the end. One cannot or does not want to see what the formulated proposals meant for Ukraine. That would be not only their failure, but also their disappearance. And for the western democracies, that would not only be tantamount to failure, it would actually be a guarantee for more wars by Russia.
22102	13	The wishful thinking consists in the ludicrous notion that there is currently a political force or substantive arguments in this world that would convince the Russian regime to call for a ceasefire or even bring peace negotiations to the table. Believing that the West would avoid further escalation by stopping arms sales to Ukraine meant only one thing for the Russian leadership: they would get what they hoped to achieve through the most expensive means - intimidation, blackmail, division - simple given.
22102	15	"Seen from an abstract or philosophical point of view, the theses put forward in the appeal may sound noble, but in practice they are just hollow. In the best case. From a less friendly perspective, they are even unpardonably naïve, cynical, or both. And in the worst case, they are simply grist to the mill of Putinism. Strange - but in the end probably only logical - how nebulous, terribly imprecise and ambiguous the authors of such open letters become, just at the point where it should become concrete. Instead, one reads formulations such as ""measures should be taken as soon as possible"", ""work should be done with great vigour"" or ""prerequisites for this should be created""."
22102	17	It's not a coincidence. If you think the matter through to the end, it can only mean two things: either Ukraine should sacrifice itself for the benefit of the (still) less affected humanity, including German and European ones. Or you don't really understand the whole issue and believe in Russia's willingness to end the war voluntarily. Although the authors of the open letter pull out all the rhetorical stops imaginable so as not to let this suspicion arise in the slightest, in fact one always reads exactly that in the subtext. That is why the signatories should perhaps simply be more open and blatant, this would be at least contribute to the clarity of the discourse.
22102	19	But even if they admitted to themselves and the public that Ukraine should surrender so that we could finally have peace and quiet, this ignored the terrible price that the country would be doomed to pay: cleansing, expulsions, Executions, terror and endless suffering. Secondly, it also concealed the fact that this would neither really end this war nor prevent further Russian wars of aggression. Quite the opposite: Russia felt prompted to do the latter.
22103	1	Supreme Court: Democrats have underestimated the power of anti-abortion advocates
22103	3	"It would be easier if the Chief Justices alone could be held responsible for repealing the right to abortion, which has been in force since 1973. But there are also structural factors and problems with democracy that made the June 24 verdict possible. Democrats and progressive America have underestimated the traction and endurance of the anti-abortion movement. The latter was probably due to numerous surveys, according to which only a minority of Americans wanted to cancel the now overturned verdict. The case of Roe v. Wade"" had once legalized abortion until the fetus was capable of independent viability. At the time of their majority in Congress, the Democrats did not legislate for the right to terminate a pregnancy."
22103	5	And then it happened: Just hours after last Friday's verdict, the first clinics rejected women. More than 20 US states will legalize it in the next few months. Pregnant women - if they have the money and courage - have to travel to Mexico or to democratic states for the procedure. According to the logic of the judgment that abortion is not protected because there is nothing in the constitution about it, other rights are also threatened, first and foremost that of same-sex marriages.
22103	7	"Conflicts over anti-abortion legislation will now shift to state legislatures. The Democrats have not done well there in recent years. In some ban states, consideration is being given to preventing pregnant women from traveling. In addition, surveillance is being considered that could show who is ordering abortion pills, which one also wants to ban. On each ""Roe v. Wade” anniversary (apart from a Covid break), tens of thousands of anti-abortion opponents had gathered in Washington. Initially with little prominence, in 2020 with Donald Trump, who assured that ""unborn children"" had never had a ""strong defender"" in the White House like him. The events were predominantly white, strongly Catholic and, over time, evangelical. Many young American women were there, apparently animated by the desire, as their posters said, to save babies and to express that women were also victims of the ""abortion industry"". Stars of the movement are women who regret abortions. Republicans have been passing laws across the states to restrict abortion for years in anticipation of Day X."
22103	9	Opponents of abortion not quite satisfied
22103	11	"Abortion is not just about abortion. The anti-abortion movement, with its emotional appeal, became part of the right-wing movement, bolstered in the 1970s by the burgeoning ""Christian Free Market and Biblical Right Right."" They were white voters, many working-class, who switched to Republican. Ronald Reagan had signed a liberal abortion law as governor of California, and only found the ""right attitude"" as Republican president. Which helped sway his party and the anti-abortion movement towards right-wing populism."
22103	13	"You used each other. The same goes for the Trump years. The entrepreneur from New York City spoke out against abortion bans in a 1991 interview with NBC (""I am very pro choice""). During the 2016 election campaign, when Trump was anything but the preferred candidate for conservative Christians, he had learned something new and presented his list of anti-abortion lawyers for the Supreme Court and the federal courts. That worked. White evangelical voters voted 80 percent for him. And they were rewarded. The fact that Trump was able to enforce his three judges, who were decisive in the anti-abortion verdict, also has to do with the structure of the US government. In the Senate, which votes on the chief justices, each state gets two senators - the rural, sparsely populated, Republican-leaning ones as well as the democratic giants of California and New York. Liberal California has about the same population as the twenty smallest US states. California has two senators, those twenty have forty. The composition of the Supreme Court is an example of how the politics of a right-wing minority can assert itself in the USA. When Republican states introduced restrictive electoral laws against groups of voters leaning toward the Democrats, the Supreme Court sanctioned it."
22103	15	Opponents of abortion are not yet satisfied with the new status quo, which does not completely prohibit abortion. Abortion rights movement calls for voting in November. A national law, enacted by a majority of Democrats, could protect abortion rights.
22105	1	Madrid: President Erdoğan left the NATO summit with rich gifts
22105	3	For Turkey, the outcome of the recent NATO meeting is impressive. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is reaping basketfuls of fruit for abandoning the veto on Sweden's and Finland's accession. He has achieved a lot, played out a robust exclusivity in the alliance - if not to say savored it - and demonstrated to the whole world how much the northern expansion depended on him. The alliance was spared the embarrassment that the next increase failed at this summit of all places, with which the leap into an epoch-making mode of fighting against Russia was pending.
22105	5	"To go through Erdoğan's haul in detail: Basket I contains the last-minute memorandum sealed between Turkey and the NATO aspirants. Thereafter, the two northerners pledge to take steps against ""Kurdish terrorism"" on their sovereign territory. This means that they are required not to stab Turkey in the back in the ""anti-terrorist fight"" against Kurdish self-determination, as was the interpretation in Ankara, but rather to be a support. This applies not only to south-eastern Anatolia, but also to northern Iraq and north-eastern Syria, i.e. non-Turkish territories in which the Turkish army has already invaded, violating international law, and wants to intervene again."
22105	7	"She has the Kurdish workers' party PKK in her sights, as well as the Syrian-Kurdish YPG militias, which have managed to keep a region's democratic self-government against the Assad state for a decade. The paradigm of this alternative meets the destructive arbitrariness of Turkish regional power. NATO tolerates that. What's more, it accepts that a member who regards the breach of law as a raison d'être decides whether and under what conditions new admissions take place. When was the ""strength of law"" ever given so much weight? Apart from the fact that the aspirants do not emerge unscathed from this evaluation at the expense of third parties."
22105	9	"Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde disputes whether the agreement with Erdoğan extends to the extradition of ""terrorist suspects"", meaning Kurdish migrants who are politically active in exile in Scandinavia: ""We will not agree to extradition unless there is evidence of terrorist activity activities.” In addition, the memorandum is “a political agreement and not a legally binding international treaty”. But who defines “terrorist activities” when Turkey already considers an emancipatory claim, such as that represented by the YPG militias in Syria, to be a “terrorist conspiracy”? One wonders whether Uyghurs in western exile should expect to be treated in the same way as Kurds in Sweden and Finland."
22105	11	Which means Basket II is due, which US President Joe Biden chose to pack himself. His administration is now supporting the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. We are ready to do more to modernize the Turkish Air Force. Celeste Wallander, US Deputy Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, announced at the briefing call with journalists that the stronger Turkey's defense capability becomes, the better NATO is defended.
22105	13	Punishment was yesterday
22105	15	This is new – there was still no talk of such causality in October 2021, quite the opposite. By that time, Ankara had already asked the White House to approve the purchase of 40 F-16 fighters and 80 US-made aircraft modernization kits. This request was not rejected for the first time. Reasoning that Turkey acquired the Russian S-400 air defense system in 2019, is guilty of breaking a taboo and has effectively left NATO air defense. A behavior worthy of sanctions that would be mercifully punished if fighter jets were refused. Nine months later, the penalties are gone, and instead a deal is being launched: if the Turkish president concedes his veto against NATO's northern expansion, the American president will approve the desired arms deal in return. Of course, the US Senate still has to be questioned. He has to decide whether Biden's commitment to Erdoğan was worth something or not, whether the Commander in Chief will be dismantled in the West's fateful struggle against the Russian enemy, or whether the opposite seems advisable.
22105	17	What remains is Basket III, in which Erdoğan can stow the mandate to mediate an agreement between the UN, Moscow and Kyiv, also with the approval of the USA. It is intended to ensure that stocks of Ukrainian grain leave the Black Sea ports. Russia has already told the United Nations that it will join Turkey-supervised plans to ship 25 million tons of grain in secure convoys from the port of Odessa, which remains heavily mined by Ukraine.
22109	1	Activists face extradition
22109	3	"In the course of NATO's northern expansion, the Turkish government is demanding the extradition of Kurdish activists from the designated new members Sweden and Finland. The Federal Republic does not need such requests. It has long been willingly handing over Kurds to its ""strategic partner"". As supporters of the opposition, they face imprisonment and torture. The 27-year-old student Yaser Örnek now has to fear the same thing. The Turkish government under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan prompted his arrest by plainclothes police officers in Bavaria near Bernau am Chiemsee, as the Kurdish news agency ANF reported on Saturday, citing Örnek's lawyer. His transfer to Munich is planned for Tuesday."
22109	5	"The arrest took place on July 2nd. According to the ANF, Örnek was traveling through Switzerland with a friend at the time when they were stopped by the officials on the A8. Örnek and his companion Durmaz Yahisi were held for several hours, each with their hands behind their backs. At first, no reason was given to the two, said Örnek's companion, according to the ANF report. Yahisi was later let go, as Kerem Schamberger, an activist from the non-governmental organization Medico International, announced on Twitter on Friday. ""We all have to prevent that together,"" he had demanded in view of the threat of Örnek's extradition."
22109	7	"He received political asylum in Switzerland in June 2018 after the literature student at Cukurova University in Adana was accused of ""membership in a terrorist organization"" in connection with his legal political activities for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). According to Schamberger, the student had already had to spend three months in Turkish custody after taking part in an HDP meeting during the election campaign. Banning proceedings are currently under way in Turkey against the left-wing, pro-Kurdish party. Three cases are still pending against the 27-year-old, according to ANF he was last sentenced to several years in prison."
22109	9	"""The federal government apparently wants to play a pioneering role in NATO in the political persecution of the Kurds in return for Erdogan's compliance with the military pact,"" criticized Bundestag member Sevim Dagdelen (Die Linke) on Sunday to Junge Welt. In the direction of the federal government, Dagdelen said that anyone who ""delivers Turkey to the knife"" should ""at least stop constantly trying to protect human rights."" jointly responsible for »this abominable persecution«."
22109	11	"According to Schamberger, the trigger for the arrest of the 27-year-old student and the temporary detention of his companion was that the Turkish state had issued Yaser Örnek with the European Police Office, Europol for short, for a search. Turkey is currently demanding the extradition of 406 people from the EU member states, Civan Akbulut from the North Rhine-Westphalia State Integration Council said on Saturday, citing Turkish press reports on Twitter. Accordingly, 129 extradition requests were made to the federal government. ""The dirty NATO deal between Turkey and Sweden/Finland is having an effect,"" Akbulut commented."
22109	13	Meanwhile, German-Turkish cooperation is being maintained at the highest level. The Attorney General at the Federal Court of Justice, Peter Frank, traveled to Turkey for high-level talks from Tuesday to Thursday last week, as the Frankfurter Rundschau reported online on Friday. The trip was therefore started at the invitation of Frank's colleague Bekir Sahin. According to another ANF report on Saturday, he is the chief prosecutor in the banning proceedings against the HDP.
22109	15	"A spokeswoman for the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe confirmed the visit to the newspaper. She did not give any details, but only explained that ""topics for discussion with the representatives of the Turkish judiciary"" included ""the tasks and work of the respective criminal justice system"". According to the report, Frank also met with President Erdogan. Referring to the Turkish pro-government daily Yeni Safak, the Frankfurter Rundschau also named 129 extradition requests to the Federal Republic of Germany. Those affected are supporters of the »Gülen movement«, which, like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), is being persecuted in Turkey as a terrorist organization."

2211	1	What crisis?
2211	3	The following essay is from Dr. Lee Gerhard, a retired geologist from the University of Kansas (BS in geology 1958, MS in paleontology minor in 1961, and PhD in geology in 1964). dr Gerhard believes that climate change has been a natural phenomenon driven by natural processes for 4.5 billion years, but that there is now cultural pressure to find a human cause for the current trends.
2211	5	“I never fully accepted or denied the concept of anthropogenic global warming until the wild claims made by NASA's James Hansen caused a sensation in the late 1980s. I have consulted the [scientific] literature to examine the basis of this claim, starting with the first principles. My studies then led me to believe that the claims were false.” —Dr. Lee Gerhard
2211	7	It is startling that so many scientists have deliberately abandoned their principles to advance a theory of climate change (anthropogenic warming) that has already been contradicted by empirical data. They prefer to believe their computer models, which are designed to support their beliefs because of the assumptions they contain. That there has been warming since the second half of the 20th century is undeniable. To attribute this tiny amount of warming to human-caused carbon dioxide and to prophesy that it is dangerous to humanity is either malicious and demonstrates either a willful misrepresentation of climate history or ignorance.
2211	9	Ice core temperature reconstruction is empirical, reproducible and accessible. The earth has been getting colder for more than 4000 years (Davis and Bohling, 2000). The 'cooling' was episodic, certainly on a millennial scale, with warm peaks variously labeled as Minoan, Roman, medieval, and presumably modern (Alley, 2000; Cuffey and Clow, 1997).
2211	11	There are other datasets that are not empirical but relate human activities and artifacts to temperature. The comprehensive data published by Lamb (1996) documents and illustrates the relationship between temperatures and human activities by interpreting soil sequences, recorded history such as wine production in England, Roman Empire tax records, and the like. The amount of data is almost overwhelming, showing the large swings in global temperatures over the centuries and millennia prior to the last 50 years, long before humans added significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Lamb illustrates that human civilization flourished during all warm periods; in the intervening cold period pestilence and poverty raged.
2211	13	"The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is seen by the media and governments as the authoritative authority on the state and future of the world's climate, but it is not a scientific group. Although he belongs to a group of scientists, he is political, not scientific. Its mission is a political agenda: ""Documenting the human impact on the global climate"". It is neither a scientific investigation nor a test of your assumption that carbon dioxide emitted by humans controls global temperature."
2211	15	"Now that the global temperature has not risen to cause a ""crisis,"" scientists who dare comment on the data, thereby challenging the IPCC hypothesis, will be reprimanded by the social media church and the academic world excommunicated. They have lost their income, their jobs and their acceptance. Being a true scientist is not easy these days."
2211	17	The warming of the last few decades has been beneficial, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and helping to feed a growing world population. It is unfortunate that this climate cycle appears to have come to an end. Will pestilence and famine prevail?
22111	3	The turning point does not seem to have been understood in the media. No, not THE turning point, including a special fund for the Bundeswehr (for the use of which, please, a permanent investigative committee should examine every procurement, commission and every vague promise that the weapons can achieve), but a turning point that is happening right before our eyes, because we are stricken with the hallucination that the miserable 20th century threatens to repeat itself in reverse. Now the epidemic waves came first, followed by dying on the battlefields. Massive deaths from starvation soon followed, as Stalin accepted almost a hundred years ago.
22111	5	The hallucination is heard as an audio track. In the first weeks of the war in 1914, 50,000 war poems ended up in German newspapers every day. The bourgeoisie seemed to have gone mad in the face of the present. For Ernst Bloch, this was the benchmark for reactions to the oil crisis in the early 1970s. Today, however, it is not about the political rhetoric of who stands by whom and how, or ducks behind the backs of the Ukrainian defenders, nor about the question of how many more or less light weapons are supplied by whom and when. It's about interpreting symptoms.
22111	7	An article by Michael Hanfeld recently read in the FAZ: “While defeatists and war-weary people meet on German television, the Russian war of annihilation in the Ukraine continues. Reporters Without Borders is counting the number of journalists killed.” Defeatists were once Elisabeth von Thadden, Daniil Charms, Hans von Sponeck, the members of the White Rose, Wolfgang Borchert, Ezra Pound and many others.
22111	9	Proxy war of the Germans against themselves
22111	11	Hanfeld is referring to the idle but fast-paced, self-revolving TV talk shows that, in an attempt to understand what's happening, they do their credit, try to fathom what's actually happening in almost identical replay loops. Defeatists are accused of discouragement and pessimism. With the sights and sounds of the battlefields, who can blame them?
22111	13	The courage on the front lines, however, differs from the long-distance courage of the commentator. He slips rhetorically into the robes of a judge, but commands no court-martial and has no guillotine or firing squad, but pretends with his words that this is the case. Oops!
22111	15	"Sigmund Freud described these symptoms precisely. Feuilleton texts can also be understood as a substitute action. This also applies to open letters of any kind that help their signers to stale fame. (You were right – yes or no?). What does the author want to replace with the accusation of discouragement? The praise for the victims among the war reporters? Your own marching orders to the front? In view of the serious situation, that would be too cheap. A leading article by Ullrich Fichtner in the current issue of Spiegel (""Drückeberger Deutschland"") has a similar effect. Behind the pompous rhetoric of both authors, there is a longing to finally be on the right side of history. So it looks like a proxy war by the Germans against themselves. ""Now, have a nice win!"" said the then Federal President Theodor Heuss to soldiers of the Bundeswehr in 1958."
22112	1	Mask, lockdown, school closures: is everything really ineffective?
22112	3	"Germany not only has the “summer wave”, but also report season. Within a few days, four ruthless assessments of corona policy since 2020 were published. Minister of Science Bettina Stark-Watzinger (FDP) started with the Education Report 2022: The reading, writing and arithmetic skills in primary school classes have fallen dramatically due to the months of school closures, psychological abnormalities becoming more common in children and adolescents. ""The experience of stress among schoolchildren aged 11 to 17 has risen sharply during the pandemic,"" according to the findings. Unsurprisingly, child and adolescent psychiatric clinics had reached their capacity limits during the pandemic."
22112	5	"A few days later, the 2021 education trend also painted a sad picture of German school operations under the politically prescribed pandemic conditions. The proportion of children who fail to meet the minimum standards for secondary schools by the fourth grade has increased significantly. The ""social and immigration-related disparities"" have increased. The poverty report 2022 also reported a deepening of the social division on Wednesday last week: At 17 percent, the poverty rate reached a new high. Because the pandemic measures did not hit all layers equally, but low-income earners, single parents and families with many children were particularly hard. ""Poverty has never spread so rapidly in recent times as during the pandemic,"" said Ulrich Schneider from the Joint Association at the presentation."
22112	7	Simulation instead of evidence
22112	9	"The drastic social consequences of the corona measures are well documented. A commission of experts should evaluate what these deep, permanent incisions have brought medically. Your findings have been available since Friday last week - and are devastating. Even in the otherwise leisurely topics of the day, the commentator was clear: ""I could scream. Loud and long.” Because for many of the measures that were controversial from the start, there is simply no scientific evidence or, due to the data situation, only insufficient scientific evidence. A key sentence of the evaluation is: ""Overall, there is no discernible connection between the level of incidence and the strength of the measures."" Even the effect of the access restrictions due to 2G rules, which discriminate against large parts of the population, was ""rather small"". The few available studies produced a “very heterogeneous picture”."
22112	11	"Regarding the school closures, which were among the longest in Europe, it is said that their influence on “containing the spread of the corona virus” is “still open despite biological plausibility and numerous studies”. Even the combined evaluation of almost 7,500 studies on this topic shows that ""the effectiveness and the strength of the effect of school closures on the infection process are still uncertain"". Historical essays on the effectiveness of lockdowns during the Spanish flu, such as the one on which, according to Spiegel, Christian Drosten based his sudden change in mood regarding school closures in spring 2020, the report attests at best “anecdotal evidence”."
22112	13	"The report contains a remarkable passage on the lockdowns, which were considered to be completely without alternative at the time: ""Despite the rather hesitant assessment of the effects of lockdowns by the WHO on the basis of pandemics before SARS-CoV-2"", most countries resorted to this measure. ""This was also due to the very clear results of a computer simulation model that was presented by Neil Ferguson in the spring of 2020 on the basis of a non-quality-checked scientific publication and received a great deal of attention."""
22112	15	It's hard to believe, so again: the WHO made it clear even before Corona that the scientific evidence is not exactly pushing for lockdowns. But on the basis of a single model calculation that had not even gone through a review process, this maximum measure was taken around the world.
22112	17	"Unfortunately, the expert report does not say a word about the ban on visits to hospitals and nursing homes, some of which are still in place today, as a result of which old people, including people with dementia, were isolated inhumanely for months. That people because of other people - not from the virus! - had to die alone because of the ban on visiting, is a social scandal. He has to be worked through: because while camera teams were allowed into the intensive care units for melodramatic reports, family members were not even allowed to say goodbye at the moment of death. The border closures in March 2020 and the stop to the humanitarian admission of refugees are similarly scandalous and unfortunately mentioned in the report with just one word - ""ineffectiveness"". One of the wealthiest countries in the world with one of the best-equipped healthcare systems locked out those seeking help and disguised it as “solidarity”."
22112	19	The assessment of the experts on the mask question reads like a formula compromise in order not to alienate any side and in order not to have to deny the evidence of all measures. Among other things, animal studies have confirmed the benefit of mouth and nose protection, according to three parts of the evaluation. In the footnote, unfortunately no joke, reference is made to a corresponding study with Syrian golden hamsters. The sections on masks are an accommodation to the specifically German obsession with masks, which our neighboring countries do not have. While the evaluation rejects the wearing of masks outdoors - remember that a few months ago demonstrations in Germany were banned and sometimes violently broken up because not everyone wore a mask - the experts are in favor of a possible mask requirement indoors . Of course, without wearing a mask when presenting the report in a hall of the Berlin Science Center.
22112	21	Again and again it is argued that it is just a piece of fabric, a simple, effective measure with a low degree of intervention. However, a study by the FU Berlin recently showed that the mask requirement in the population is the most controversial, even before the controversial state contact restrictions. This means that it has the greatest potential for social division. In any case, when it comes to compulsory masks in schools, the report comes to the conclusion: “The effect of masks and compulsory masks on children and in schools cannot be conclusively assessed.”
22112	23	"""Signals"" instead of benefits"
22112	25	"As early as February 2022, the European health authority ECDC had doubted the everyday use of FFP2 masks. The experts now agree with this without leading to a rethink on the part of those responsible. When Bavaria abolished the FFP2 mask requirement in local transport at the weekend, there was criticism as if the evaluation had never existed. That was the wrong ""signal"". And that's what it seems to be all about, signals, not evidence. In the fall, the mask will “play a role again,” the Federal Minister of Justice announced somewhat sibylline."
22112	27	"The people in the country have long been voting with their faces and their feet on the pandemic measures and their reintroduction or continuation. In public transport in Berlin, for example, more and more people are no longer wearing a mask, despite being required to do so. And despite the urgent request from the Minister of Health, you see fewer and fewer people with cloth in their mouths and noses when shopping, in schools or in concert halls. The restaurants, street cafés and beer gardens are full, people meet the already fading ""summer wave"" with a wave of travel. And yet parts of politics, journalism and science are not giving up, forecasting a ""difficult autumn"" and a ""long, agonizing winter"" and calling for more measures according to the old pattern. They do not even exclude those whose evidence could not be proven in the expert report."
22112	29	This ignorance of science, this trivialization of the consequential damage of the measures and the contempt for a panel of experts set up by the German Bundestag is strange and undemocratic. The evaluation commission's report could have been a first step towards overcoming the social divide, but this opportunity has probably already been missed. At least that's what the political and media reactions to the report indicate. The behavior of people who want to be right at all costs and do not want to admit their error has thwarted this possibility.
22112	31	For social peace, the Bundestag should therefore set up a well-equipped and not too tightly scheduled commission of inquiry, which, like the committee of experts, not only consists of professors, but also includes citizens and their individual pandemic experiences in the work. That would also be in line with the spirit of the evaluation report, which advocates greater public participation in view of the crisis communication that it found to be “inadequate”. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee of inquiry should look into the fraudulent affair surrounding test centers and masks and the decision-makers responsible for them.
22112	33	First of all, however, it is up to the federal government. According to the Infection Protection Act, she must submit a statement on the expert report to Parliament by September 30. This gives the chancellor the opportunity to withdraw his statement from last year that he did not know of any “red lines” in the fight against the pandemic. Because the evaluation report has defined some of these red lines. Any restriction of fundamental rights that cannot be based on evidence is no longer proportionate - and therefore unconstitutional. And when the report was presented on Friday, panel member Jutta Allmendinger warned that it was now time to apologize.
22114	1	Freedom for Julian Assange
22114	3	"Australian journalist and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was abducted from the Ecuadorian embassy in the British capital on April 11, 2019. Since then he has been treated by the British judiciary as an enemy of the state and has been held in solitary confinement under pretense. The UN human rights commissioner Nils Melzer speaks of psychological torture in view of the prison conditions. Now the judges in London must rule on Assange's extradition to the United States, where he faces a ""show trial."" The accusation: Assange had published secret US documents belonging to the whistleblower Chelsea Manning on the Wikileaks platform, which he co-founded, proving war crimes by the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan. If convicted on 18 counts, he faces up to 175 years in prison, which is life imprisonment. After years of court hearings about the US extradition request, which Assange had to spend in “British Guantanamo”, the high-security prison in Belmarsh, British Home Secretary Priti Patel has now decided that Assange should be extradited to the United States."
22114	5	It's about global press freedom
22114	7	Assange is being prosecuted for journalistic work outside the US exposing war crimes by the US military. If he is actually extradited and convicted in the USA, this will have far-reaching consequences for journalists – worldwide. And yet the seriousness of the situation does not seem to have reached everyone. Because this case is not only about Assange's fate, but also about freedom of the press. The US government is trying nothing less than to criminalize the disclosure of secret crimes by US state organs not only in the US but worldwide. If that succeeds, the example will set a precedent, not only in the USA.
22114	9	The US does not prosecute the war crimes, but those who uncovered them
22114	11	Not one of the crimes uncovered by Wikileaks has been prosecuted by the US judiciary. Instead, whoever uncovered them is pursued. The message is clear: freedom of the press in the world should end where US war crimes are at stake. Assange's fate is meant to be a warning to anyone dealing with information that is embarrassing to the US security apparatus. The US protects those who unlawfully kill and torture on its behalf. The US is always in favor of freedom of the press and human rights when they are a nuisance to its geopolitical opponents. If supposed interests of one's own security apparatus are affected, that's over. It would be up to President Biden to stop the extradition request against Assange. But he doesn't.
22114	13	And what does “value-oriented foreign policy” say about that, Ms. Baerbock?
22114	15	"Before the federal election, Annalena Baerbock had joined the demand of the UN special investigator Nils Melzer and demanded the release of Assange. Now she is a minister, now her word would carry weight. But the State Department, headed by Baerbock, floundered, speaking of “legitimate security interests” in the United States and refusing to make a clear statement. What kind of “value-based foreign policy” is that? The federal government should protest the extradition and offer Assange asylum! A foreign minister who doesn't dare to do that shouldn't tell us anything more about ""value orientation""."
22114	17	This is what LINKE Chair Janine Wissler says:
22114	19	“Exposure of war crimes is not a crime, but a humanitarian and journalistic duty. The federal government must not continue to apply double standards and look the other way when freedom of the press is trampled on in countries like the USA. Julian Assange must not be extradited. He must be released immediately and Germany must grant him political asylum.”
22114	21	You can do that!
22114	23	"- The ""Free Assange Committee Germany"" organizes vigils and other actions. You can join!"
22114	25	- How does the newspaper report? Write a letter to the editor!
22114	27	- Apply for a solidarity resolution for Assange in your club.
22114	29	- Are you a journalist? What does your professional association say? Get active!
22114	31	- Support an online petition and invite your friends and acquaintances to do so. Almost 600,000 have already signed (as of June 20, 2022).
22114	33	- Write Julian a letter. Address on the left of the envelope. He could use encouragement!
22114	35	Free Julian Assange!
22115	1	Stay calm. STOCK IN STOCK! Corona is no worse than a flu epidemic. ALREADY 53 GERMANS INFECTED!!
22115	3	There is therefore little point in panicking. The German healthcare system is one of the best in the world and is well prepared for a possible epidemic. THE VIRUS IS NEW AND UNTESTED! NO ONE IS SAFE FROM HIM!
22115	5	Although there is some turbulence on the stock market due to the spread of the virus, a global economic crisis is still a bold forecast at the moment. WHEN THE CRASH BEGINS EUROPE, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE TAKEN DOWN. THIS RECESSION COULD MARK THE END OF CIVILIZATION!
22115	7	Young, healthy people don't have to worry much anyway, as only people over 60 or with existing illnesses are at risk. THE DOCTOR WHO DETECTED THE VIRUS DIED FROM IT!!! IRANIAN DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH IS INFECTED!!! JENS SPAHN LOOKED A LITTLE PALE AT HIS LAST PRESS CONFERENCE!
22115	9	It's totally overkill to get nervous about anyone who coughs or sweats a little in public right now. MOST OF THE INFECTED DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY HAD THE VIRUS BEFORE HUGGING 300 PEOPLE AT CARNIVAL SESSIONS!!!
22115	11	In a few months all the excitement about the corona virus will be forgotten anyway, BECAUSE WE WILL ALL BE DEAD BY THAT!!!

22117	1	The curse of evil deeds
22117	3	by Andreas Wehr – http://www.andreas-wehr.eu
22117	5	"The meeting of the European Council on June 23, 2022 should actually be a ""celebration day"" for the EU. With Moldova and Ukraine, two countries were given candidate status, which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says are firmly part of the European family - a word that says a lot about the EU itself, but it makes a country like Ukraine, riddled with corruption, suppressing all opposition and banning critical media, described as ""excellently fitting for the Union""."
22117	7	"However, the EU's ""holiday"" was spoiled by the appearance of the six heads of those Balkan states who are trying to join the Union - and have often been doing so for a long time. Albania became a candidate for accession about eight years ago and North Macedonia has been waiting for seventeen years. The situation is similar for Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo."
22117	9	"""Welcome to Ukraine,"" said Edi Rama, the Albanian Prime Minister, according to the FAZ on June 24 in Brussels: ""I hope that the Ukrainian people are not under any illusions about it."" And he added sarcastically: ""Vladimir Putin may be very sick, but this place certainly doesn't look very healthy.”"
22117	11	Why isn't progress being made with the accession of the Balkan countries to the EU? Why are you threatened with exemplary embarrassment here? Brussels likes to point to the countries in this region as the reason for this: Greece initially blocked Macedonia's accession for a long time, only renaming North Macedonia cleared the way. Then it was Bulgaria that threatened to veto the accession of Albania and North Macedonia. And above all there are Serbia and Kosovo, which do not recognize each other.
22117	13	But that's not even half the truth. The fact is that in the Balkans today the West is once again confronted with the problems left by the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, in which NATO and the EU have played their part. After all, it was Germany that prevented an all-Yugoslav solution to the crisis by recognizing Croatia and Slovenia. The Western-enforced separation of Kosovo from Serbia laid the groundwork for unrelenting hostility between the two. Small Macedonia, which previously existed as part of Yugoslavia, only aroused the desire of three states after its independence: Greece, Bulgaria and Albania. And whether Bosnia-Herzegovina, internally torn between Bosnians, Croats and Serbs, will ever become a member of the EU is more than uncertain. So it is the curse of the West's evil deeds that the EU is facing again today in its Western Balkans policy.
22117	15	The article was published in an abbreviated version on July 1, 2022 in the newspaper “Unsere Zeit”.

22119	1	Stations closed: Hospitals are worried about the many failures caused by Corona
22119	3	Stations close Hospitals are worried about the many failures caused by Corona
22119	5	The number of staff shortages due to corona diseases and quarantine in German clinics is increasing sharply. These effects of the corona summer wave posed considerable problems for hospitals and doctors in order to be able to guarantee patient care.
22119	7	"""We have received reports from all federal states that individual wards and departments have to be deregistered due to a lack of staff,"" said the CEO of the German Hospital Society (DKG), Gerald Gaß, the editorial network Germany. At times, emergency admissions would also be canceled at the rescue control centers. »This situation worries us considerably in view of the upcoming autumn.«"
22119	9	"In the hospitals in Schleswig-Holstein, among other things, the situation is tense due to the corona cases in the workforce. ""Everywhere it is worth mentioning to difficult,"" said the managing director of the Schleswig-Holstein hospital association, Patrick Reimund. According to Reimund, one driver of the infection process in the Kiel area could have been the Kiel Week at the end of June. It is not yet possible to assess how the situation will develop in the coming days."
22119	11	Shorter or even longer quarantine for staff?
22119	13	In view of these difficulties, FDP Vice Wolfgang Kubicki has already demanded that staff be able to return from isolation more quickly – the quarantine times must be shortened. He suggested a free test using a quick test after just three days, so far there have been five. A free test is generally only recommended, it is mandatory for hospital and nursing staff.
22119	15	"The German Foundation for Patient Protection has now rejected the demand for the shorter quarantine. This ""is fueling the uncontrolled spread of Corona,"" criticized foundation board member Eugen Brysch in the newspapers of the Funke media group. Instead, he demanded: “Therefore, the isolation period for corona positives must be extended to ten days. This may only be shortened if a PCR test is negative.«"
22119	17	"Meanwhile, the situation on the ground is sometimes still critical. The University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) announced last week that it would temporarily close stations at its Kiel and Lübeck locations. As of Friday, 479 employees were in quarantine at the UKSH. “Since then there have certainly been more,” said spokesman Oliver Grieve. ""We had an extremely tense weekend."" Renewed compensation payments for lost revenue resulting from the postponement or suspension of plannable recordings, operations or interventions are necessary."
22119	19	"The scientific head of the intensive care bed register, Christian Karagiannidis, told the ""Rheinische Post"": ""The intensive care occupancy is only increasing moderately, but the occupancy for a summer is relatively high, and the available beds are becoming fewer and fewer due to the lack of staff."""
22119	21	"It is therefore important to use the time now to optimally distribute capacities. »This includes regional networks for the best possible distribution of patients according to the level of care. Cooperation, but also relief for staff, will be the order of the day this autumn and winter,"" said Karagiannidis, who also sits on the Federal Government's Expert Council."
22119	23	The number of infections has risen sharply in recent weeks. The Robert Koch Institute gives the official number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days at around 650. Experts estimate the actual number to be about twice as high because many infected people no longer do a PCR test and are therefore not recorded.
22119	25	"The head of the GEW education union is already concerned with the high number of infections. Maike Finnern called for a legal basis for mask and test obligations in order to avoid school closures in autumn. “This includes the possibility of a mask requirement if the number of infections continues to rise sharply. But this also includes the possibility of reintroducing regular tests in educational institutions in the event of high seven-day incidences,"" she told RND. Everything must be done to prevent schools and daycare centers from closing again."
2212	1	Even mainstream experts are switching to drugs instead of injections
2212	3	In autumn, the vaccination madness in our country should continue. It is said that preparations for the fourth stitch are already being made in Lower Austria. But even if the next corona variant should be significantly more pathogenic than Omicron, according to a vaccine expert, it is probably only dangerous for people with a weak immune system. For everyone else, it will be no more than a seasonal virus.
2212	5	"“Alone today?” the waitress asks me in the café where I often meet my friend Axel B., who is the same age. ""Unfortunately"" I answer: ""He has Corona and is in quarantine at home!"" ""Hasn't he been vaccinated?"" the waitress wants to know while I sit down and make myself comfortable at a corner table. ""Yes it is,"" I reply: ""Three times - and it's even boosted."" I refrain from adding that I'm still not vaccinated, but I'm perfectly healthy. My friend, who works in a leading position for a large Austrian non-profit organization, had had himself vaccinated in good time because he travels often and because it suits his cautious nature."
2212	6	Corona despite injection
2212	8	"He found out that he had Corona from his family doctor. He went there because he felt ""flu"" as he said and because he was also plagued by a cough. The doctor then did a Covid test and my friend went straight to quarantine. There he now remains inactive, although he should actually be preparing a large congress for his organization. “What do you actually do when you feel like you have the flu?” he asked me over the phone as I was sitting in our café, alone this time, with a cappuccino. ""Well, I'll pop in an 'Aspirin Complex' and suck on some Ivy tablets, and I'll be fit again in no time,"" I say, comforting him: ""You can go for the free test in a few days."""
2212	9	Good news
2212	11	However, based on my experiences over the past two years, I consider the testing and quarantine to be unnecessary. Because neither prevents anything! As is well known, infected people can be contagious even before the symptoms begin, I am currently reading a statement in the “Presse” in my favorite café by Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccine science at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. I have only been tested once since the pandemic broke out and that was in the fall of 2020 after visiting my GP to get a prescription for flu medication. Of course he tests me for Corona.
22120	3	Ulrike Henning thinks it's time for a crisis cost debate
22120	5	Anyone who heats with natural gas has had to cope with a sharp increase in costs since the end of last year. But now the joy of new horror scenarios for autumn and winter seems to be boiling up. As if the social dissonance of the pandemic had long been forgotten, a new dimension of upheaval is being talked about, as if there were no remedy. The head of the Federal Network Agency, Klaus Müller, speaks of additional burdens of up to 3,000 euros per family simply due to a foreseeable gas shortage. And explains straight away what that can mean: no new washing machine, no vacation trips are still possible.
22120	7	Calls for savings are based on fear: if you are not willing to freeze and do without now, you have the next recession on the clock. If you keep taking warm showers, your company will close soon. It is of little use simply postponing the increased payment until later. So you want to heat for another winter, but then you can no longer pay the rent at all?
22120	9	"Ordeal seems to be the word of summer. DIW boss Marcel Fratzscher warns politicians against trying to ""pacify people with placebos such as one-off payments."" But then what? Wage increases or a generous social climate bonus, as suggested by left-wing politicians?"
22121	3	Terribly failed and without insight
22121	5	Prime Minister Boris Johnson has wreaked political havoc and is taking his time leaving
22121	7	He delivered a resignation speech without using the word resignation. There was no sign of self-knowledge or even remorse for lies and incompetence in Boris Johnson. Instead, Britain's prime minister resorted to insulting his inner-party opponents, who allegedly followed a herd mentality. By appointing new cabinet members to fill the vacant ranks in government, Johnson has demonstrated that he intends to remain in office until a successor is elected in the fall. On July 30, the Downing Street shameless man is planning a big wedding reception with his wife Carrie at the Checkers residence - funded by taxpayers' money. Boris Johnson can't get out of his skin.
22121	9	An incumbent successor, such as Johnson's deputy Dominic Raab, does not get a chance. Conservative John Major, who preceded Prime Minister between 1990 and 1997, had urgently advised such a clear break. But that ship has already sailed, says Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Treasurer of the Conservative Committee that organizes the succession election process. New parliamentary elections are also unlikely.
22121	11	The country is in a chaotic state after Johnson's almost three years in office. Brexit and inflation are affecting the economy. Laughed at by former EU partners, the government came up with illegal acts such as breaking the EU exit agreement signed by Johnson or the plan to expel boat people to Rwanda without examination.
22121	13	Potential successors to the grandiose failure now have to gather a team behind them, get in touch with Tory MPs, make them promises and ask for support. There are a number of prospects and group votes on them are imminent, with candidates dropping out with low approval. Only after this lengthy process has been completed will the two Tory MPs with the highest number of votes stand for the final election by party members. A winner will not be known until September at the earliest.
22121	15	Two aspiring aspirants have already thrown their hats in the ring: Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs committee, and Suella Braverman, who as the government's chief legal adviser - like others now trying to find Johnson's successor - is loyal to the prime minister despite a constant stream of scandals stayed. Until the moment when it no longer seemed advantageous to her. Tugendhat is not compromised by membership of the Johnson government and represents the moderate wing of the party. However, he was not a Brexit supporter, which in the eyes of many Tory politicians will do him more harm than good. In the conservative Daily Telegraph, Tugendhat tried to appeal to the right wing of his party by calling for tax breaks soon, but his chances of being elected remain slim. So far, Bravermann has only been told that, to everyone's surprise, she dares to assume the highest office in the government.
22121	17	According to the BBC, the more promising possible successors have not yet been determined. Rishi Sunak, previously Finance Minister, and Sajid Javid, who headed the Health Department, may have a bonus because they left the sinking government ship by stepping down this week - albeit quite late - and are clearly in favor of Brexit. The same applies to Transport Minister Grant Shapps, who is a political lightweight in comparison.
22121	19	"The most popular candidate for prime minister among Tory MPs and members right now is Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. He was able to draw attention to himself by quickly helping Ukraine. He is in competition with Secretary of State Liz Truss, who had herself photographed in a British battle tank to evoke memories of the ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher. Truss wants the House of Commons to scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol to end her earlier opposition to Brexit. Jeremy Hunt, Johnson's defeated competitor from 2019 and then not a member of the government, also wants to run again, according to the BBC. Farthest to the right is Steve Baker, the most prominent member of the Europe research group, which gathers die-hard Brexit enthusiasts. In short: the race to succeed Johnson is on and open."

22122	1	Short and the big donor (nd-aktuell.de)
22122	3	Short and the big donor
22122	5	Even after his retirement from politics, the ex-Chancellor remains in conversation
22122	7	Collecting donations was the master discipline of Sebastian Kurz and his team. There were whole lists on which the names of big industrialists can be found - the Who's Who of Austrian entrepreneurship. One name on this list of donors particularly caught the eye: Alexander Schütz, years ago, before Kurz resigned due to allegations of corruption. Now Kurz and Schütz are actually and officially in the same entrepreneurial boat. Together they founded »AS2K Beteiligungs GmbH«, an investment company that wants to take on care and medical issues.
22122	9	Intentionally or unintentionally, consciously or not: After years of corruption investigations and after years of counterattacks by Kurz on his critics in the judiciary and the media, this cooperation now seems like an outstretched finger. True to the motto: Catch me if you can. Along with the certainty: You can‹t. The investigators and journalists had their sights set on Schütz's donations.
22122	11	"Schütz came out of nowhere. So far, the Austrian had actually made an appearance through his activities in Germany. There he first worked as an investment advisor, boxed his way up, advanced to an investor through foundation constructs in Liechtenstein and then finally ended up on the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank (2017 to 2021) - from which he left rather dishonorably in the course of the Wirecard affair had to. Schütz was considered the intimate of ex-Wirecard manager Markus Braun. When the Financial Times began dealing with the Wirecard scandal, Schütz had good advice for Braun: he should ""finish"" the newspaper. This reference to his relationship to the media is particularly interesting in view of later activities."
22122	13	Parallel to his rise as an investor, Schütz became a major donor to the Kurz-ÖVP. In two tranches he supported the ÖVP in 2017 with 40,000 euros and a second time in 2018 with 45,000 euros. And as far as the consideration is concerned, it wasn't really a big secret at all: Alexander Schütz' wife, Eva Hieblinger-Schütz, was initially appointed to the cabinet, where she works in the ÖVP-led Ministry of Finance. This was followed by the accolade: the appointment to the supervisory board of the transport subsidiary of the Austrian Federal Railways. A classic Austrian supply post, a lucrative one mind you.
22122	15	It was also never a secret that the Schütz family had excellent relations with Thomas Schmid, the man who, as the control center behind Kurz, handled all the half-silver political deals in order to ultimately be promoted to the board of directors of the state-owned investment company ÖBAG. However, Schmid's phone had been confiscated during a corruption investigation and turned out to be a treasure trove of political atrocities.
22122	17	And Alexander Schütz himself? In March 2021, he founded a medium called »eXXpress«: an online tabloid with a completely undisguised political bias. From the outset, the paper aimed its writing guns at exactly one target: the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Economic and Corruption (WKStA). Kurz already had a veritable conflict with the WKStA and constantly attacked them.
22122	19	These were and still are the allegations that the WKStA as well as parliamentary committees and the media researched in the orbit surrounding Kurz: unfair agreements; irregularities in campaign funding; accepting donations for consideration; Positions filled beyond any qualification and bypassing advertising procedures; influencing and suppressing investigations into shop stewards in the judiciary; falsifying surveys for one's own benefit; paid reporting; False testimony before Parliament on all of these allegations.
22122	21	This Kurz-Schütz saga is now richer by a chapter. And: A company needs employees, and above all a company needs leadership. And who would be more suitable than Vera Regensburger. Until recently, she was Deputy Head of Cabinet for Chancellor Karl Nehammer. Under Kurz, she was head of politics and strategy at the ÖVP headquarters.
22122	23	Kurz is now planning to expand his own “SK Management GmbH”, which is considered the foundation of a management consulting firm. Offices in Tel Aviv and Dubai are scheduled to open soon. Kurz also continues to work for the US entrepreneur Peter Thiel. Incidentally, Kurz is very present in the »eXXpress« medium, especially in interviews with publisher Eva Hieblinger-Schütz.

22123	1	Double jet and super highs: the consequences of extreme weather (nd-aktuell.de)
22123	3	Double jet and super highs: the consequences of extreme weather
22123	5	Due to global warming, extreme weather events are occurring in many places - including here. But the consequences hit the Global South far more severely
22123	7	Extreme weather events are once again casting the shadow of unabated global warming this year: forests are burning in Brandenburg, Greece and Croatia, Italy is groaning under a severe, prolonged drought, and large parts of Somalia are experiencing what is possibly the worst of the rainy season after a fourth failed rainy season drought since living memory. Natural weather phenomena such as La Niña play a role in this, but they are undoubtedly being amplified by global warming. Conversely, in China and Australia, extensive heavy rainfall is currently leading to devastating floods.
22123	9	"For years, climate researchers have been warning of an increase in extreme weather events as a result of climate change. The central driver is the global rise in temperature: »In a warmer atmosphere we have more water in the form of water vapour. Regardless of whether the jet stream has changed and the weather patterns are therefore lasting longer, the mere fact that it has become warmer automatically means that the probability of extreme precipitation increases,"" explains the climate scientist at the Geomar Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel , Mojib Latif. Conversely, the greater evaporation also leads to more drought. ""Those are two sides of the same coin,"" says the oceanographer."
22123	11	The jet stream is a band of wind over the northern hemisphere that blows at a height of five to ten kilometers at a speed of up to 500 kilometers per hour, shifting high and low pressure areas eastwards. But in 2018 nothing worked for months. The highs and lows hung over each region, a phenomenon we may see more and more often.
22123	13	And that's not all: This week, a study by Efi Rousi from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and her team appeared in »Nature Communications«, in which they investigated why there were three to four times as many in Europe in the last 40 years Heat waves occurred like in North America. They found out that the jet stream divides over longer and longer periods of time: one arm lies over southern Eurasia, the other over northern Eurasia. This affects Western Europe in particular: »In this region, the weather systems usually come from the Atlantic and therefore have a cooling effect. However, when the double jet occurs, the weather systems are deflected northwards and sustained heat waves can develop in western Europe,” explains Rousi.
22123	15	The form of the Azores high has also changed since the beginning of industrialization. In a recent study in »Nature Geosciences«, US scientists were able to use simulations to show that in the last 1200 years it has never expanded as much as it has since 1850. Since then, very large high-pressure areas have also occurred much more frequently. As a result, the Iberian Peninsula in particular is experiencing increasingly drier winters.
22123	17	Tropical cyclones are also becoming more violent. This coincides with the models used by climate researchers: As more water evaporates as temperatures rise, there is more latent energy in the atmosphere that can be released again with a hurricane.
22123	19	The developments are not new, but they are becoming more visible as climate change accelerates. At the latest, the three following drought years of 2018, 2019 and 2020 as well as the Ahr Valley flood have shown us that we in Germany are not immune to climate change. Here, too, people die in heat waves or floods. But the intensity of climate impacts varies by location, and the ability to protect against or deal with it depends on the financial capabilities of those affected and their governments.
22123	21	A drought year in Germany is not the same as one in Italy, where temperatures climb well over 40 degrees and water has to be rationed. A drought year in Italy, on the other hand, is not the same as one in Somalia. Almost three million people are fleeing there, almost two million are suffering from the food emergency, which can easily escalate into famine, also because Russia is blocking grain exports from Ukraine. Alexander Fenwick, program coordinator for Somalia at Welthungerhilfe, therefore urgently calls for humanitarian aid to be expanded.
22123	23	13 years ago, the so-called industrialized nations promised the countries that are suffering the worst from global warming, but have hardly contributed to it, to pay 100 billion dollars a year for climate adaptation measures from 2020 onwards. To this day, this promise has not been fully kept. »Somalia is one of the most fragile countries in the world. Somali communities are incredibly resilient and adaptable,” explains Fenwick. Other countries could learn something from this. But every adjustment has its limits, especially in view of the country's political situation and the great poverty of many people there.
22123	25	Where and how extreme weather events affect people
22123	27	Across the planet, extreme weather events cause suffering, harm, and loss. In many cases they even call into question the basis of human existence. An incomplete look at the world map makes the diverse manifestations clear – and the threats they pose.
22123	29	Country under in Australia
22123	31	"Large parts of Australia's largest city, Sydney, are currently under water. In some areas it is the fourth flood this year. Over 80,000 people had to be evacuated and many areas of the city are without electricity. Due to a storm, a ship got into distress off the coast, but it cannot be towed into a port or evacuated at the moment. For this reason, the ""Portland Bay"" was towed further out to sea. However, the reason for the flooding is not the storm, but heavy rain. Because warm air can contain more water, such events are increasing in many countries around the world due to global warming."
22123	33	In February, March and April there had already been severe flooding in eastern Australia, where Sydney is also located. At that time, more than 20 people died and there was (insured) damage of 3.2 billion euros, estimates the Australian industry association for insurance companies, the Insurance Council of Australia. This made the floods the costliest in Australia's history, at least from an insurance perspective. But they probably won't stay that way for long. The management consultancy Deloitte estimates that the economic costs of natural disasters in Australia will increase significantly: from 25.4 billion euros per year to 48.8 billion euros in 2060. That would correspond to almost doubling in 40 years.
22123	35	Eastern Australia will be particularly affected: the Deloitte report estimates that two-thirds of the damage will occur in this part of the country. This is partly because the big cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra are located there, and partly because of climate change. Not only heavy rain events continue to increase, but also tropical cyclones. Because of the warmer sea water, these are getting further and further south, where the big cities are – Australia's new normal. Christopher Mueller
22123	37	Melting glaciers in Italy
22123	39	"After a mass of ice, rubble and snow buried several mountaineers on Mount Marmolada last weekend, media around the world reported on the ""accident in the Dolomites"". The term is poorly chosen, since »misfortune« includes surprise, the unpredictable and the accidental. The catastrophe did not come out of the blue - and it will be repeated."
22123	41	In recent years, there have been several tragedies caused by glacier retreat in the European Alps that were quickly forgotten, writes Joern Ehlers on the World Wildlife Fund blog. It was not until May 2022 that two people died in a demolition in the Swiss canton of Valais. Geographer Luca Bonardi fears that thousands of glacier sites in the Alps alone are just as dangerous.
22123	43	Climate change is causing higher temperatures, which are contributing to more snow and ice melting. This causes the glaciers to shrink and possibly break off. Like at the foot of Mount Marmolada. The demolition was preceded by a long-lasting heat wave in Italy. At the altitude of the Marmolada glacier, the temperatures were around ten degrees Celsius - usually they hardly exceeded the freezing point. This, together with little snowfall in winter, favored the catastrophe.
22123	45	"Between the 19th and early 21st centuries, temperatures in the Alps rose twice as fast as the global average, reports Copernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme. In addition, the UN has identified the Mediterranean basin as a region that is extremely vulnerable to heat waves. According to Italy's National Science Council, the Marmolada glacier has been shrinking for decades and is expected to be gone in 25 to 30 years. Overall, Italy's glaciers have shrunk by 40 percent since 1962 and will continue to do so. The consequences are catastrophic - for agriculture, energy and water supply. ""The current drought in Italy,"" says Ehlers, ""provides a foretaste of this."" Stephan Kaufmann"
22123	47	Rising Sea Levels in Brazil
22123	49	Flash floods, landslides, 133 dead and more than 25,000 homeless: That is the sad result of the most recent rain disaster at the end of May in the coastal region of the north-eastern states. Deforestation of gallery forests and Atlantic rainforest, rampant urban sprawl and land sealing are the main causes. But climate change is also partly to blame. This is the conclusion reached by a research team from the World Weather Attribution Initiative, which took a close look at the catastrophe. Without human-caused global warming, rainfall in the Northeast would have been about a fifth less intense, the researchers said. They assume that extreme heavy rain events will become more frequent and more violent in the region.
22123	51	In the Brazilian Amazon region, climate researchers have found that the atmosphere over the rainforest has become drier over the past 20 years, making droughts more likely. On the one hand, the cause is the progressive deforestation and slash and burn for the expansion of cattle pastures and soybean fields. But global warming is contributing to this reduction in humidity in the Amazonian atmosphere.
22123	53	Another consequence is already clearly visible in the north of Rio de Janeiro: the rise in sea levels. Since the 1960s, the sea has been eating its way in the estuary of the Rio Paraiba do Sul at a rate of three meters per year. According to the mayor's office, at least 500 houses on the beach of Atafona fell victim to the floods as well as the city's main traffic artery, which was built parallel to the coast. But here, too, climate change is not solely to blame. The main causes are dams and the overuse of the Rio Paraíba do Sul as a source of drinking water for industry, agriculture and the megacities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The drastically reduced flow and its reduced sediment load no longer have anything to oppose the advancing sea. Norbert Suchanek
22123	55	Rushing rivers in Western Europe
22123	57	The traces of the flood of July last year are still most clearly visible in the Ahr valley. Some houses there still look like ruins. Some of the mud deposits still show how high the water was at that time. Estimates assume at least seven meters. For comparison: the Ahr normally has a water depth of just over 70 centimetres. 141 people died in the flood in the Ahr Valley. More than 220 people died in the entire flood area, which also affected Belgium and the Netherlands in addition to the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate.
22123	59	Scientists were quickly able to explain to what extent global warming had contributed to the flood disaster. Two factors in particular play a prominent role. First, as temperatures rise, so does the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The German Weather Service (DWD) assumes a temperature increase of 1.6 degrees in Germany between the years 1881 and 2019. This means that the proportion of water vapor has increased by 11.5 percent over this period. More water vapor means more rain. Incidentally, so is the risk of thunderstorms. A second factor: the jet stream is decreasing and moving north. The band of strong winds is slowing because the temperature differential between the tropics and polar regions that otherwise drives it has decreased. Instead of a continuous wind, the jet stream today often runs in waves. This increasingly leads to very slow moving or even standing betting events.
22123	61	This combination enables extreme rainfall, in the flood region more than 150 liters per square meter were measured within 24 hours. Unusual amounts of rain and the narrow development of the valley ultimately led to the disaster on the Ahr. Sebastian Weierman
22123	63	Burning forests in Russia
22123	65	As many as 61 fires covering 2,456 hectares were extinguished in 22 regions on July 6, according to Russia's forest protection agency Awialesoochrona. Another 24,812 hectares are still ablaze across the country. Russia's forest is on fire, affecting all regions from the Black Sea to the Pacific and also the arctic areas. A state of emergency has been declared in four regions. A third of the country's area is forested, a total of 1.3 billion hectares. Forest fires happen every year, and according to the state forest agency, they cost the economy an average of 20 billion rubles (286 million euros).
22123	67	Forest fires in Russia have increased in recent years. In 2021, over 18 million hectares burned, a new record. Even President Vladimir Putin called for better protection of the forest. Humans are almost always to blame when there is a fire, be it a campfire or the burning down of dry grassy areas. The infrastructure in need of rehabilitation also plays a role, for example when power lines tip over and sparks are produced. However, Russia is also increasingly feeling the effects of climate change, especially in the Arctic regions. In Yakutia alone, more than seven million hectares of forest fell victim to the flames in 2021. The fire brigade and volunteers were on duty for weeks, often in regions that were difficult to access. According to experts, the main reason for the massive fires in north-eastern Russia was the increase in the average temperature in the permafrost region by three degrees. Environmentalists fear that the fires could thaw the frozen soil and release large amounts of bound greenhouse gases. In addition, the loss of the taiga would be fatal for the climate.
22123	69	The war in Ukraine is also becoming a threat to Russia's forests. The Ministry of Defense wants to cut as much wood as it needs for “defense purposes” by the end of the year. Daniel Säwert
22123	71	drought in East Africa
22123	73	"Russia and Ukraine are among the main suppliers of staple foods in East Africa. The blockade of the Black Sea ports by Russia and the rise in world market prices are making the supply situation in the region even more difficult; it was already precarious beforehand. Because in East Africa several rainy seasons have failed one after the other. The crops have withered in the fields. The World Food Program warned early on that many people will need additional food aid in the coming months, up to 18 million people. ""Three countries are particularly affected: Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia,"" says the regional director for East Africa, Michael Dunford."
22123	75	In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, which has been ongoing since November 2020, has been added to the drought. Since July 2021, the region, which has around 5.5 million inhabitants, has been in what the UN has described as a “de facto blockade”. It was imposed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is at odds with the regional government, which is rehearsing a militant uprising with its military arm TDF. Because of the blockade, less than 10 percent of the food aid needed is reaching Mekelle, the region's capital. So far only one road has been cleared for humanitarian convoys. How many people have already died of starvation in Tigray cannot be checked, as access to the region is denied to independent organizations and journalists.
22123	77	A quarter of a million people died in a famine in Somalia in 2011. In 2017, the early warning systems installed took effect and a catastrophe of this magnitude was averted. In 2022 it is anything but certain because the international community is not focused on East Africa. And the areas of Somalia hardest hit by the drought are controlled by the Islamist group Al-Shabab. Access for helpers there is just as difficult as in Tigray. Martin Ling

22124	1	And if we go to the dogs: the main thing is that Russia doesn't win
22124	3	"The slogans of ""defending the free world"" seem to be getting less and less popular in the USA, where prosperity has been shrinking massively since Corona. The Russian USA correspondent reported on this in the weekly news review of Russian television and I translated the article again because it sounds completely different from what the German media reports from the USA."
22124	5	Start of translation:
22124	7	America is ready for recession and famine as long as Russia doesn't win
22124	9	An unexpected message. The University of Chicago Institute of Politics has released a poll in which almost a third of the US population (28%) said they may have to take up arms against the government very soon. We must not forget that Americans own more than 400 million guns. But that's just a side note. Our correspondent reports from the USA.
22124	11	The Americans are traveling. By plane, by car, to their families over the weekend to celebrate 4th of July, Independence Day. For families, it will be the most expensive vacation in history. There is some unhealthy advice on saving from progressive economists. Bloomberg suggests not treating pets but letting them die to get rid of the extra cost.
22124	13	“Bidenflation” is a term that has become mainstream in America. Inflation under the oldest president in history is 8.6 percent. Gas prices, food prices, everything is going up. The markets are collapsing before our eyes. The Nasdaq is down 30 percent in six months for the first time in history, and the SP 500 is down 20 percent, not seen since the 1970s. JP Morgan analysts think the US economy is dangerously close to recession.
22124	15	"“Americans are already feeling the effects of the recession. They believe it has already begun. Food prices are steadily increasing. Atlanta Federal Reserve data confirms that the recession is not imminent, we are already in it, no matter what the White House says,"" said businessman Andrew Puzder."
22124	17	The White House doesn't bother to explain itself. All economic failures are blamed not on the miscalculations of the Biden administration, but on the intrigues of Russia.
22124	19	“Fuel prices are rising because of Russia. The reason for our food crisis is Russia. Russia blocks the export of Ukrainian grain. I understand that Americans are angry about inflation, but inflation is high in almost every country. The prices at the gas stations are high in almost all countries. But we are in a much better position than others,” Biden affirms.
22124	21	The US has the worst inflation rate among the G7 countries. The allegations against Russia are not convincing either. Only one in ten Americans believes the myths that the Kremlin is driving up gas station prices in the US. Gasoline prices have been rising not just since February 24, but since the early days of Biden's presidency. Under him, fuel prices have risen 125 percent.
22124	23	“How long will American motorists and motorists around the world pay this price for the war in Ukraine?” asked one journalist.
22124	25	"""As long as the war lasts. Russia must not defeat Ukraine and go beyond Ukraine. This is a critical situation for the entire world,” Biden said."
22124	27	This question was not asked spontaneously at the press conference. Biden gave the floor after a pre-compiled list. Apparently, his advisors wanted to remind the Americans once again of the President's thesis: freedom has its price. In doing so, Biden justified the cost of anti-Russian sanctions on the global and domestic markets. Its economic course has pushed oil prices from $70 to $120 a barrel and they could go even higher, into space.
22124	29	As CNN reports, the government is working on scenarios for dealing with an oil price of $200 a barrel. He could approach this mark as early as autumn.
22124	31	"""What do you say to the families who say, 'We can't pay $4.5 a gallon for months or even years?'"
22124	33	"“The President has made it clear what is at stake. It's about the future of the free world. We have to stand our ground,"" said Brian Dees, senior economic adviser to the US Presidential Administration."
22124	35	The leader of the free world, as Biden is immodestly dubbed in the White House, has his own view of the world. He has called Saudi Arabia a rogue state and is now, as if nothing happened, on his way to the crown prince to talk about increasing oil production. Until recently, Washington considered Ukraine to be one of the most corrupt countries; now it is being inundated with money and guns. There is another weapons package worth $820 million. In just those few months, Washington has paid out around $50 billion for Ukraine alone. The allies also play their part.
22124	37	"“All they want from you in Kyiv is support in the form of money and arms. However, you should understand that, as we warned you from the start, the resupply of the latter, as well as the mercenaries from your states, were and are legitimate targets for us. And facilities where these weapons and mercenaries are stationed or stored also become legitimate military targets. They are stored in cities and residential areas, putting them at risk. You use civilians as human shields and by supporting them you betray the very values ​​you claim to promote,"" said Russia's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky."
22124	39	That was at the regular session of the Security Council, where President Zelensky, contrary to tradition, again had the opportunity to speak via video link. He wore a khaki t-shirt and was asking a lot. Expel Russia from the UN, supply more arms to Ukraine. Today, anyone can ask as much as they want of the average American.
22124	41	This is a prime time TV show in support of Ukraine. Selensky is allowed to speak live, stars sing and money is collected. What the funds collected from viewers will be used for is not disclosed. The Pentagon proposes to control state funds flowing into Ukraine. It has repeatedly stated that supplies to Kyiv are disappearing into a black hole. American weapons could fall into the wrong hands.
22124	43	“Unless Western weaponry changes the battlefield situation, the stakes in this conflict are so high that US officials are accepting even the prospect of a global recession and famine. The main thing is that Russia does not win. If the Ukrainian army is defeated in the Donbass pocket, after the humiliation in Afghanistan, it would be the second defeat of a huge US-funded and trained army in two years,” writes National Review.
22124	45	Biden's name will forever be linked to the shameful American flight from Afghanistan, where they had been unable to achieve anything for 20 years.
22124	47	His name is now synonymous with inflation and sky-high prices. His compatriots disappointed the head of the White House on the important holiday. More than 70 percent of voters do not want Biden for a second term. Before Independence Day, the polling institutes conducted a traditional poll. Residents of the United States were asked what it was like for them to be American. The poll is almost a quarter century old, and if at the beginning of the millennium 70 percent felt incredibly proud to be an American, now only 38 percent of American passport holders are brimming with pride.
22125	1	Russia is feeling the effects of Western sanctions, but they are far from unbearable
22125	3	"The Russian economy is currently experiencing unprecedented pressure from a group of countries led by the United States, which has imposed more than 10,000 individual sanctions on the country, its citizens and its companies. Never before in history has such a range of sanctions been imposed on a country. Even Iran, which has been the West's geopolitical whipping boy for many years, is ""only"" subject to about 3,600 individual sanctions."
22125	5	The sanctions pressure on Russia has steadily increased since 2014, when sanctions began to be imposed on key sectors of the economy, such as energy, the military-industrial complex and the financial sector. Since then, the citizens of Russia have learned to distinguish between the gloomy predictions associated with sanctions and the tangible results of their implementation. While in 2015 about 60 percent of Russians believed the sanctions would have no impact on their lives, in 2020 almost 90 percent said they felt no impact. In short, people adapted and became accustomed to the threats. Unemployment did not increase and was even at historically low levels. Low inflation has made many banking products, such as consumer credit and mortgages, affordable and is helping fuel a housing boom in some parts of the country.
22125	7	"According to the Russian authorities, the country lost about 50 billion US dollars as a result of the sanctions, but was able to compensate for them. ""I am not concerned about these sanctions,"" President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Russian media in March 2020. This sentiment is shared by the Russian people. Western sanctions have not affected the lives of the country's citizens, nor the approval ratings for its leadership. On the contrary, confidence in the country's president has increased. Western political scientists have observed that the imposition of sanctions on Russia only resulted in a ""gathering under the flag,"" in which external pressure only encourages the determination of a country's citizens to rally around their leadership."
22125	9	However, the sanctions introduced over the past four months are much stricter and more comprehensive. The sanctions list includes not only legal and natural persons, but also the state as an institution itself, represented by its president, the prime minister and the ministers.
22125	11	"Meanwhile, pressures from the West's dominant ""culture of devaluation"" have driven foreign companies out of the Russian market in droves, ranging from oil and financial firms to chain retailers and recruiters. Sweeping measures have also been taken to erase every trace of Russia from global sport, culture and even history. Russians feel that the West is trying to inflict maximum pain on them by erasing their past, complicating the present and obscuring the future."
22125	13	The official explanation for this policy is that the measures were taken to change Russia's foreign policy. While Western politicians regularly stress that the sanctions are not aimed at the Russian people themselves, most ordinary people consider this hypocritical rhetoric to be nonsense.
22125	15	"Oleg, a student at a Moscow university, observes: ""If the real purpose of the sanctions is to set back Russia's economic development by decades, it means that the well-being of ordinary Russians will also suffer."" Western countries are doing everything to weaken the ruble, increase inflation, disrupt supply chains and create shortages of consumer goods to make Russian residents uncomfortable and create social tension."
22125	17	The sanctions imposed are already all-encompassing and affect not only individual sectors but the entire economy of the country, so it is not surprising that the number of those affected has increased. In March, the Russian Center for Public Opinion examined the impact of sanctions on Russians' daily lives and concluded that half of the population buys or plans to buy cheaper goods instead of expensive ones, while one in five respondents is involved in projects such as home renovations , relocations or educational projects. As a result, the majority of Russians — about 60 percent — said the sanctions affected their lives in some way.
22125	19	"An outside observer unfamiliar with how things work here in the country might assume that this figure not only indicates the impact of sanctions, but also indicates an increase in political risk and the likelihood of protests. But even according to estimates by Western-funded research centers, the proportion of Russians who believe the country is definitely ""going in the right direction"" has remained steady at 65 to 70 percent in recent months. These are very strong indicators."
22125	21	"The leaders of many ""successful democracies"" in the West, which have shown positive economic growth, although this has lost momentum after the COVID-19 crisis, can only envy the Russian leadership for such a level of confidence. US President Joe Biden's approval rating, for example, is only 36 percent, and the trend is falling and the bottom is far from being reached."
22125	23	Hoping to use sanctions and the exodus of Western companies to lure ordinary Russians onto the streets, the West, firstly, simply doesn't understand the structure of the country's economy, and secondly, neither does what the Russian people cite as reasons for the recent Events in Ukraine sees or who it blames for them.
22125	25	"More than 60 million people, more than half of the country's adult population, including pensioners, are economically dependent on the state in one way or another. Almost none of the civil servants, law enforcement officials, military personnel, doctors or teachers who ""work for the state"" are willing to heed calls from the West to resign their government posts in protest at the events in Ukraine."
22125	27	Roman, a state banker who entered the field a little less than 20 years ago, says his income had been steadily increasing through February this year. Of course, financial opportunities have diminished since 2014, when the first round of Western sanctions was launched and the value of the ruble plummeted after reunification with Crimea, but stability remained.
22125	29	No one would argue that the situation is easy as the bank I work at has been sanctioned. But there is no question of laying off newly hired employees or those who have been with the company for many years. The same applies to salaries. There's probably little hope of a pay rise in the near future, but don't expect cuts in monthly wages and bonuses just yet, Roman says.
22125	31	In such a situation, it is obvious that working in state-affiliated companies offers much greater stability than employment in European or US companies, many of which leave employees completely in the dark about their future.
22125	33	The last time I went to the office was on March 4th. I've now been working from home for almost three months, although it's hard to call work, says Anna, an employee of a major European housewares manufacturer.
22125	35	Well, my salary continues to be paid, albeit not in full, and there is almost no work to do other than post documents, hold Zoom meetings with co-workers, and so on. But most of all I fear the unknown. Everyone knows that one day the staff may be fired once and for all and everyone will lose their jobs. It's a shame to build a career over so many years, working your way up from a simple salesperson to a department manager, only to understand that you'll probably either have to start from scratch or face stiff competition once you're kicked out of the job market .
22125	37	According to analysts, even the largest companies cannot afford to keep staff for much longer than three months. Many companies have already started selling their branches in Russia, realizing that they can no longer afford to remain in limbo. Some large Western financial sector companies offered their employees a three-month retraining course with further job opportunities abroad. But given the attitude towards Russians in the western labor market, many do not see this as a viable option.
22125	39	"They promised to pay my salary in full for the next six months and sent us to Dubai for an unpaid internship. In the end, those with the best scores will be recommended for transfer to the company's offices around the world, explained another woman named Anna, an employee of a US financial services firm that has shut down operations in Russia. ""But what should I do? I have to try. It's difficult to find a new job in the financial sector in Russia. Banks don't lay people off, but they don't hire them either. They have, as my recruiter friends say, a hiring freeze introduced. My husband had to quit his job so he could accompany me to Dubai. I was always the main breadwinner in our marriage. Now it's 'take it or leave it', as they say. Either I continue to work abroad or we return both will return to Russia and will both be unemployed."""
22125	41	"In fact, the sanctions against Russia inflicted the most pain on the country's most educated and wealthy sections of the population: residents of big cities, whose lives depended far more on imported goods, foreign travel, and so on. As such, these are the people who most felt the loss of Visa or Mastercard and the departure of well-known retail brands. But these ""losses"" are not critical, and the government is doing everything it can to offset the inconvenience caused by parallel imports."
22125	43	The less affluent segment of the population, which according to some unofficial estimates accounts for almost a quarter of the country's population, is less dependent on imports and suffers far less from these sanctions.
22125	45	"Many people understand that the reasons for the current economic difficulties - as in 2020 - are primarily external in nature and secondly have nothing to do with negative economic or market forces. That said, the difficulties are not due to a failure in the country's financial markets or the fallout from domestic economic cycles. In 2020, Russia faced a forced shutdown of business and public life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the country is being sanctioned by the world's leading economic centers for its handling of what experts call ""geopolitical risks."""
22125	47	"Support for the government's policies is not prompted by economic factors, but rather by an understanding that the conflict that is currently taking place is less between Russia and Ukraine and more between Russia and the so-called ""collective West"". Many believe sanctions would have been imposed on Russia regardless of its behavior because the West ""wants to weaken Russia"". This strong belief, expressed more than once by President Putin, is largely based on distrust of US foreign policy. Sociologists have noted such distrust since the late 1990s, when NATO began expanding eastward."
22125	49	In the early 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, there was great enthusiasm in Russia for strengthening ties with the United States. Many Russians believed that both countries and their peoples would become strategic partners and reliable friends after the Iron Curtain was a thing of the past.
22125	51	Unfortunately, this partnership and friendship never came about. Hopes gave way to disappointment and suspicion, particularly after NATO illegally bombed Yugoslavia and the US launched wars in the Middle East and withdrew from all arms control treaties. Negative attitudes towards US foreign policy intensified after 2014, when a government coup took place in Ukraine with clear US support. The tougher the confrontation between Russia and the US has become since then, the higher Putin's approval ratings have risen.
22125	53	However, Russian society is convinced that the President's foreign policy is not aimed at domestic political support, but at the security of the Russian state. In this sense, economic difficulties can be overcome.
22125	55	"The government understands that the Russians are ready to ""tighten their belts"" and is not afraid to admit that difficulties lie ahead. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Russia's economy was in the ""most difficult situation in the last 30 years"". According to the central bank, the 2022 crisis is one of the biggest challenges that the Russian economy has faced since the 1990s."
22125	57	The country expects GDP to fall by up to 10 percent in 2022, and economists estimate it will take five to six years, with annual growth of 2 percent, for the economy to return to 2021 levels. And this growth is by no means guaranteed. Economists fear inflation could reach 15 to 20 percent by the end of this year, while unemployment will peak at 8 percent. The public sector, however, will be the most protected from downsizing. Russians' real disposable income will fall by 7 to 8 percent before returning to current levels.
22125	59	"Pjotr, a 35-year-old employee of an IT company, has not lost his optimism and is trying to assess the situation comprehensively: ""Russia is conducting a special military operation to ensure its physical security. Sanctions are a good reason, economic security ""Now Russia has a unique historical opportunity to further develop its own industry and agriculture. The country can already provide itself with grain, vegetable oil, fish, meat and potatoes. The sanctions will only make the country even stronger in the future."""
22125	61	In fact, today's sanctions, including those against the transport and logistics sector, have a greater impact on Russian imports than on exports. Imports are declining in both physical and monetary terms. Taking into account the current exchange control measures in place, including the obligation for exporters to sell part of their foreign exchange earnings, the prevailing market situation in which exports exceed imports directly contributes to the strengthening of the ruble.
22125	63	The exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar hit a low of more than 136 rubles per dollar on March 9. Since then, the national currency has appreciated by more than 100 percent. A ban on the export of dollar and euro banknotes to Russia created a discrepancy between cashless and cash exchange rates. A cash dollar or euro is traded at a premium of 15 to 17 percent over the cashless rate. However, it is important to note that both exchange rates have been showing the same uptrend since March.
22125	65	The introduction of exchange controls played an important role in reducing panic in the markets and among the population, which increased confidence in the safety margin of the Russian economy and even lowered the prices of some imported goods and services. The President's decision to require European countries to pay for gas in rubles was also an important factor in bolstering demand for the ruble.
22125	67	"There is one group of people who will benefit directly from this strengthening of the Russian currency, and that is tourists. Ilja, a 42-year-old employee of a construction company, is happy about the reduced prices at his favorite holiday destination abroad: ""Our family consists of four people. We looked at the prices for a trip to Turkey in March, but it was very expensive, and we didn't go there. But the strengthening of the ruble made a seaside holiday affordable for our family this summer."""
22125	69	"Of course, the country still has a lot of work to do to adapt to the new conditions, but there is an understanding in society as to why this situation has arisen. And in a world of high uncertainty, consensus on fundamental issues is already a good starting point for launching new initiatives."""
22127	1	Ambivalence towards the Putin regime and the Ukrainian resistance
22127	3	The Russian war of occupation against the Ukrainian population is leaving deep scars on the left spectrum, especially in the German-speaking countries. Parts of the old peace movement as well as left-wing organizations and magazines are guided by geopolitical camp thinking and show understanding for the security interests of Russian imperialism. Others derive from an abstract understanding of the imperialist world system that the Russian aggressors and the attacked Ukraine, which is ultimately waging a proxy war for NATO, should be equally weakened. Those who, based on a comprehensive anti-imperialist understanding of the Russian regime, not only regard Ukrainian resistance to the occupation as legitimate, but also support it, are in the minority.
22127	5	The positions reproduced in this contribution to the debate belong to the author and do not necessarily have to correspond to those of the Freiheitsliebe editorial team.
22127	7	The confusion is great. The Sozialistische Zeitung (SoZ) is one of those who celebrate this confusion with deliberate ambivalence. Its pages feature graphic interviews with Ukrainian leftists and excellent analysis of Russian imperialism, but also manipulative and distorted propaganda in support of Putin and neocolonial arguments to delegitimize the Ukrainian resistance. The SoZ editorial team thus gives the impression that all these positions contribute equally to finding a left position. To a certain extent, it is part of the identity of neo-Stalinist journals, which are rooted in geopolitical camp thinking, to adopt uncritically manipulative and reactionary propaganda. Unfortunately, the disorientation in the course of the Russian war in the Ukraine also tempted left-wing magazines such as the SoZ to adopt such a practice. Using the example of the SoZ, I show in this article that a fundamental political and strategic problem arises from the cultivation of such a pluralism.[1]
22127	9	Between camp thinking and socialist discussion
22127	11	"In March 2022, the Sozialistische Zeitung enclosed the 50th issue of the “Zeitung gegen den Krieg” (Newspaper Against War). It was headlined ""Why Russia Doesn't Want War"". Why the West is warmongering. Why the peace movement must mobilize"".[2] With that, the SoZ editors exposed themselves to ridicule. Now, until the start of the war on February 24, many observers were wrong about the long-term preparations for a war of aggression by Russian imperialism. But the SoZ editors were not only wrong, they also supported a publication with the supplement of the ""Zeitung gegen den Krieg"" (Newspaper against the War), which breathes the spirit of geopolitical camp thinking through every single article. Almost all articles downplay the character of Russian imperialism in one way or another. The authors are concerned about Russian security interests and not about the well-being of the Ukrainian population. One article even defends the Syrian dictator Assad against allegedly unjustified criticism. Anyone who expected a justification or even an apology from the editors for this supplement in the next issue of the SoZ hoped in vain. The editors covered up the embarrassment with a politically meaningless phrase. The SoZ continues to support the ""Zeitung gegen den Krieg"" with its entry in the imprint of the following issue 51. Despite the condemnation of the Russian war of aggression, this issue once again wants to make the Russian position understandable. At the same time, she portrays the Ukrainian resistance as irresponsible."
22127	13	In the April issue, the SoZ editors reflect on their political roots and published an excellent article by Christoph Wälz about socialist organizations in Russia and an interesting conversation with the two Ukrainian socialists Denys Gorbatsch and Denis Pilasch. The interview with an Operation Solidarity comrade about the Ukrainian resistance in the May issue[3] and the excellent article by Bernd Gehrke on Russian imperialism in June[4] help the reader to gain new insights. The detailed interview with Volodymyr Ishchenko from New Left Review in the online edition is also an enrichment.[5]
22127	15	Putin propagandist
22127	17	At the same time, in the May issue, the SoZ editors let authors have their say who either openly support Putin's position or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian defense. The SoZ publishes three articles on a full double-page spread, all of which take up elements of the official Russian argument to justify the war against the Ukrainian population.
22127	19	What prompted the editors to print a long article by former Swiss secret service officer Jacques Baud?[6] The SoZ adopted this article from the Overton Magazine website,[7] which regularly publishes publications defending the Putin regime. Baud's original French paper was published by the Center Français de recherche sur le renseignement (CF2R), a think tank on intelligence.[8] Its director and founder Éric Denécé has supported Putin and the dictators Assad in Syria and Al-Sisi in Egypt for many years. In another article, Baud justifies the Russian warfare and presents it - in line with Putin's propaganda - as an obvious protective operation for the population in the Donbass region.[9]
22127	21	In the article published by the SoZ, Jacques Baud largely adopts the Russian pretexts for the war of aggression. The author's intention to delegitimize the Ukrainian will to resist is hidden behind a wealth of detailed descriptions that are difficult to verify. “Since February 16, Joe Biden knew that the Ukrainians had started shelling the civilian population in Donbass, which presented Vladimir Putin with a difficult choice: either to help Donbass militarily and create an international problem, or to stand idly by and see how Russian-speaking people from the Donbass are being rolled over.” Baud's message is unmistakably clear: Ukraine deliberately provoked the Russian attack. The responsibility for the war lies with the government in Kyiv and with the western governments. Baud barely excuses the Russian attacks on the Ukrainian civilian population, because after all they are partially armed. “Our media propagate a romantic image of popular resistance. This image has prompted the EU to fund the distribution of arms to civilians. This is a criminal act. In my capacity as chief of doctrine for peacekeeping operations at the UN, I have dealt with the issue of protecting civilians. We have found that violence against civilians takes place in very specific contexts. Especially when weapons are plentiful and there are no command structures.” The fact that a socialist newspaper prints such statements unquestioningly, even tending to agree, is a scandal in itself.
22127	23	In other parts of the article, which were not adopted by the SCO, Baud discusses the Russian military strategy and judges it to be largely successful. He even thinks that the demilitarization of Ukraine desired by Putin has almost been achieved and that the Ukrainian army in the east of the country is almost encircled. Fortunately, the SoZ did not accept the embarrassment of this Putin-friendly misjudgment, which, however, reveals the instrumental selection of the text fragments by the SoZ editors all the more clearly.
22127	25	Jacques Baud otherwise publishes on websites in the orbit of those who downplay the pandemic and in conservative to reactionary magazines with a clear inclination to defend the Russian regime. Jacques Baud has also made a name for himself as a supporter of Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime. He denies Assad's crimes and denies the high death toll in Darfur. Critics accuse him of spreading conspiracy stories.[10]
22127	27	Jacques Baud works manipulatively and does not shy away from falsifying the statements of the cited sources.[11] An example: Baud writes in the SoZ: “However, let us remember that before February 23-24, 2022, there were never Russian troops in Donbass. OSCE observers have never seen even the slightest trace of Russian units in Donbass.” Baud also denies that Donbass rebels received Russian weapons in 2014. Baud relies on OSCE representative Alexander Hug in another article. In the quoted interview, however, he said the opposite of Baud's assertions.[12] The shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane in July 2014 is also worth remembering. The Dutch investigations unequivocally established the presence of Russian war material on the territory of Ukraine.
22127	29	Second example, Baud writes: “On March 24, 2021, Volodymyr Zelenskyi issued a decree to recapture Crimea and began moving his forces to the south of the country.” Zelenskyi did indeed issue a decree on March 24, 2021 to “ Deoccupation” and restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea. The decision complains about the systematic violation of human rights, especially of the traditional Tatar population. It emphasizes a range of diplomatic, political, economic, legal, cultural and humanitarian measures to achieve this goal, prioritizing them over military means. To interpret this decree as a preparation for the military expulsion of the Russian occupying forces is a plain falsification.[13]
22127	31	"A short research should have made the SoZ editors cautious. On the contrary, the editors justify their choice in the introduction to Baud's article as follows: ""We are unable to verify the accuracy of the facts presented there. However, we consider his description to be conclusive in itself. Nor do we adopt every one of his judgments as our own. But when he writes: 'In reality we are not trying to help Ukraine, we are trying to fight Russia', this also corresponds to our impression. The text may therefore be read as a piece of necessary counter-enlightenment.” So the SoZ names simple manipulations and falsifications as counter-enlightenment. Actually, this only allows one conclusion: the SoZ editors say that the Ukrainian resistance to Russia is reprehensible."
22127	33	This justification, in full awareness of the author's political position and in the context of the long-term planned Russian war of aggression, is nothing less than an editorial declaration of bankruptcy. At the same time, it is a political justification for Putin-friendly propaganda and places it on an equal footing with socialist criticism of Russian imperialism in other articles of the SoZ. Ultimately, with the publication of this article, the SoZ editorial team decided to spread clumsy and most perfidious propaganda for the Putin regime. Incidentally, in the introduction to Baud's article, the SoZ editorial team also says that the fake environmental foundation set up by SPD leaders in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to organize gas trade with Russia was closed in the course of the anti-Russian propaganda wave that was unleashed. Instead of taking up the climate movement's justified criticism of this gas trade and its environmental camouflage, the SoZ editorial team presents the closure of the foundation as an act hostile to Russia lies than many left.
22127	35	Steinmeier panegyric
22127	37	"On the same double page, the SoZ publishes an article by Roland Czada, Professor of Politics and Public Administration[14]. The editorial rounds off the obvious political message. The author complains that the Ukrainian government did not invite President Steinmeier and attributes this diplomatic affront to Steinmeier's role in the negotiations for the implementation of the two Minsk agreements. The author draws incomprehensible and questionable historical comparisons, for example with the Peace of Westphalia and its criticism by the Nazis. Apart from that, he knows for sure that Steinmeier's recipes would have been good for Ukraine. ""The goal of a neutral, federally structured Ukraine would have corresponded better to its history and conflict situation than a unitary state, especially since the vast majority of the population living in the east and south long rejected the country's western orientation."" Ukraine and conceals the fact that since 2014 Russia has openly questioned Ukraine's sovereignty, borders and even its very existence. In blunt neocolonial manner, the author writes: “In my opinion, the Minsk agreements and the Steinmeier formula could have solved the conflict and restored the eastern border of Ukraine. The Minsk agreements have been openly undermined by Ukrainian nationalists. The West should have put pressure on Ukraine to implement the agreement.” This article also aims to portray the Ukrainian government as hostage to right-wing extremists, portraying it as partly responsible for the Russian war of aggression and thus making the Ukrainian resistance appear illegitimate to let."
22127	39	Actually, the publication of these articles and their editorial accompaniment does not allow any other conclusion than that the SoZ editorial team designed this double page of their newspaper not out of carelessness, but with political awareness in order to make the arguments of the Russian regime understandable to the readers and to delegitimize the Ukrainian resistance. There is a wealth of rich and critical analysis of the developments in Donetsk and Luhansk (e.g. Simon Pirani's article on the pseudo-republics[15] and his analysis on the risk of escalation.[16] Socialists from Russia and Ukraine assess the history of the war and take a look at the diplomatic stage. There are many articles on this. The newspaper ak – analyse & kritik has meritoriously made a small selection of this rich material available to German-speaking readers. The Ukrainian socialists, feminists and anarchists Inside, they all scathingly criticize the Zelenskyi government, which makes its opposition to Russian imperialism all the more credible.
22127	41	However, the SoZ editorial team chose a different path. Instead, she prefers to let a Swiss Putin apologist and a German Steinmeier eulogist have their say in order to make the Ukrainian resistance appear false, Nazi-influenced and illegitimate.
22127	43	Conscious ambivalence
22127	45	In response to repeated criticism, the SoZ editors justify their publication policy on the war in an editorial note in the June issue, without, however, responding to the content of the criticism expressed, above all to the publication of Jacques Baud's contribution. She thinks it is appropriate for the newspaper to show different positions on the left on the war. However, the SoZ has not yet organized a debate. The SoZ editorial team presents the published apology for Putin as a legitimate contribution to clarifying a socialist position. It reaffirms its lurching course and asks in the June issue “what other means beyond the firepower of weapons are there to counter a highly militarized attacker To offer resistance?” She answers this question with an interview with Stephan Brües, the co-chair of the Federation for Social Defense. His proposals boil down to the Ukrainian people accepting the Russian occupation and then engaging in civil resistance. The German pacifist gives well-meaning and unrealistic, but ultimately neo-colonial advice on how the Ukrainian population can escape the hail of bombs and artillery shells.
22127	47	"In the June issue, Leo Gabriel is also allowed to share his view of a discussion at the World Social Forum. In May 2019, he paid tribute to the anti-Semitic and anti-union leadership of the pseudo People's Republic of Donetsk as part of a neo-Stalinist delegation.[17] The geopolitical world view of the occasional SoZ author Leo Gabriel shines through in his report. Casually, Gabriel weaves in the statement of Andrei Kochetov, an internationally networked Stalinist trade unionist from Luhansk who is well-disposed towards Putin and Assad.[18] He was happy that the Ukrainian troops had now been pushed back 100 kilometers. Manipulatory, he contrasts this with the angry and war-weary statement of the Ukrainian Nina Potorska and praises the ""interesting peace policy proposals"" of the Ukrainian pacifist Yuri Scheliashenko, courted in the German peace movement, who advocates conscientious objection in Ukraine. This Yuri Scheliashenko, to whom Stephan Brües also refers in his above-mentioned interview, only represents himself and moves outside of the Ukrainian left. He does not hesitate to work with political partners at home and abroad who argue in anti-Semitic and conspiracy-theoretical terms.[19] Here, too, the question arises as to why the SoZ does not even check which people and currents its author is promoting, apparently on the side, but in a targeted manner. This reminds me that in February 2019 the SoZ published an understanding conversation between Leo Gabriel and Nicaraguan dictator Ortega shortly after he had several hundred demonstrators shot."
22127	49	The course of the SoZ is deliberately ambivalent and open to geopolitical camp thinking. “We also see a lot of confusion on the left. But when positions are widespread within the left, we think it's better to want to grapple with them and understand them. The fact that articles sometimes appear that do not elicit approval from everyone is in the nature of newspaper production.” With such nonchalance, the SoZ justifies the publication of reactionary Putin propaganda and a paternalistic eulogy of the former foreign minister and current federal president.
22127	51	Now, of course, a socialist newspaper can pursue a pluralistic editorial concept. That usually makes sense too. However, there seems to have been a political decision here to deliberately open up lines of argument for the newspaper that can be classified as “campist” – i.e. rooted in geopolitical camp thinking. This camp thinking is widespread in the German left, but far removed from an emancipatory socialist perspective from below. It leads to reactionary conclusions and strange alliances.
22127	53	However, part of this ambivalence is also that the Sozialistische Zeitung is a member of the European network for solidarity with Ukraine[20]. However, that does not prevent the editors from contradicting this political statement with their journalistic orientation. The editorial justification of the newspaper's hitherto practiced orientation in the June issue and Angela Klein's non-binding editorial on the war in the same issue[21] suggests that the editorial team intends to continue its lurching course. In doing so, she devalues ​​her newspaper.
22127	55	However, it is just too tragic that the SoZ will not have a chance to gain a foothold in the climate movement with this course. Politically, this is already further along. She calls for Russia to phase out fossil fuels and sees this as an important step in order to get out of the fossil fuel economy at all.
22128	1	Fossil industry, armaments, intelligence
22128	2	On Russian Neo-Imperialism*
22128	4	Such embarrassment of left-wing positions was rare: With Russia's war of aggression against independent Ukraine, the assessment made a short time before by many prominent leftists that, despite the military saber-rattling on Ukraine's borders, Russia posed no threat of war, was reduced to absurdity .
22128	6	The most important actors in the German peace movement have publicly admitted their mistake, so a fair discussion with them is possible. But the reasons for this fundamental misjudgment have hardly been discussed to date.
22128	8	One of the most important reasons for the misjudgment is the lack of preoccupation with the aggressive character of contemporary Russian capitalism. However, this activity is not only necessary because of the current war against Ukraine and the danger of a nuclear war that has become apparent again. Because the previous smashing of the political opposition in Russia and the increasing repression of the Putin regime during the war harbors the danger that the regime will develop from the previous authoritarian presidential rule to an openly totalitarian fascist regime, as the Russian sociologist Greg Yudin recently determined .2 In the flood of war reports, for example, the fact that security forces occupied the premises of the human rights organization Memorial in Moscow, which was banned at the end of 2021, for hours shortly after the start of the war and confiscated numerous documents and computers was almost completely lost. In view of the war in Ukraine and the numerous crimes against Russian civil society, this process seems almost harmless. But this process, like the ban on Memorial itself, makes it clear that here an attack is taking place on every prerequisite for social self-organization: on the discussion of independent historical and social narratives in favor of a totalitarian ideology of domination.
22128	10	At the same time, however, the almost hopeless economic situation in which the attack on Ukraine has brought Russian capitalism represents a considerable danger, not only for the Russian opposition. Radicalization and increasing violence by the Putin regime internally and externally are to be feared. At the same time, Russia's previously announced foreign policy goals are threatening enough for its neighbors and for Europe as a whole.
22128	12	Miniatures of Russian Wild East Capitalism
22128	14	Today, the Putin regime not only openly embodies the arch-reactionary ideology of the global New Right in cultural and domestic politics, today the brutal reality of an authoritarian-repressive and neoliberal Wild East capitalism with all its ugliness is clearly before everyone's eyes. The internal composition of Russia should make it impossible to deceive about the nature of Russian foreign policy. If it weren't for the fact that many leftists are looking the other way.
22128	16	The German left hardly discusses the character of Russian Wild East capitalism, whose brutality differs little from that of Wild West capitalism, for example in the emerging countries of the South. The standard of living of wage workers is far lower than in the West and shows that Russia is still a Second World country. It is also a country with an extreme contrast between poverty and wealth, with that small stratum of one percent of the super-rich contrasting with a vast world of the poor. The so-called middle class, on the other hand, comprises a maximum of ten percent of the population. One of the first measures after Putin took office as president was the introduction of a neoliberal flat tax of just 13 percent on incomes and the implementation of various deregulation and privatization measures.
22128	18	"The pressure on militant trade unions from the phalanx of state and capital is part of the daily struggle for existence in the big cities with their masses of precarious jobs, which, like the construction sites of the country, are filled by migrant cheap labourers: inside from the Russian backyard in Central Asia. So far, leftists have shown little interest in this dramatic situation of the working classes in Russia, which is similar to the situation in other emerging countries; just as little for land grabbing and the overexploitation of nature on a huge scale, which is accompanied by acts of violence and death threats against eco-activists and resisting small farmers. With the ""Alternative"" there is even a small trade union whose goal is the liberation of people from private slavery."
22128	20	The corruption swamp of political power, police, judiciary and capital in the exploitation of people and the overexploitation of nature not only makes clear the kleptocratic character of the connection between the authoritarian state apparatus and real Wild East capitalism. He also explains the many murders of investigative journalists. State protective laws for people and nature, if they exist, are usually only cheap accessories for the often directly violent enforcement of capital interests.
22128	22	The example of VW and the class struggle from above
22128	24	"Western multinationals such as Coca Cola and VW behave no differently in Russia than they do in Mexico, for example. In 2019, for example, VW management presented a wage agreement below the inflation rate in negotiations with two company unions. When one of the two unions, the MPRA, which is part of the Independent Confederation of Labor (KTR)3 and represented 38 percent of the workforce on the collective bargaining committee, began collecting signatures from the workforce to collect their opinions, this was approved by VW management on the factory premises forbidden. As the collection of signatures continued in front of the factory gate, VW accused the unionists of ""terrorism"" and called the police. The regional Ministry of Labor then, in consultation with the governor, banned the signature campaign against existing legal rights of the trade unions.4 We have known this practice of the German flagship company's cronyism with authoritarian regimes for a long time; Brazil and apartheid South Africa are examples."
22128	26	"This incident became something of a prelude to a full-scale attack by the Russian state and the capital behind it on the self-determination rights of employees and trade unions in the following year. On May 23, 2020, the State Duma decided to abolish the previous Labor Code. This anchored the autonomous negotiation of industrial relations by companies and trade unions. In its place came a ""law that is unique in the world"", as Oleg Shein, Vice-President of the KTR, wrote. In this revision, labor relations are now ""governed by government regulations"" and in the event of ""conflict between the Labor Code and government decisions"" the ""government decision now prevails"".5"
22128	28	Militant trade unionists active in internationalist solidarity are also increasingly threatened by the “foreign agent” law, which has also been used against Memorial and other human rights groups.6
22128	30	Nomenklatura capitalism
22128	32	"In order to understand the actions of the Putin regime, it is important to visualize the genesis of today's Russian capitalism and to remember its emergence from the despotic formerly ruling ""communist"" nomenklatura. After the failed putsch by the Soviet security apparatus in August 1991, President Boris Yeltsin initiated a shock strategy of liberalizing and rush privatizing Soviet state property. The stated goal was the rapid creation of a private ""property class"" to ensure the irreversibility of the capitalist path in Russia. The consequence of this policy was a dramatic deepening of the already existing social and economic crisis with catastrophic consequences for the lives of most citizens of Russia. The average life expectancy for men fell to 63.7 years, in Moscow pensioners rummaged through the garbage cans for food, people made homeless in the course of privatization camped in Red Square, wages were not paid for months and miners went on strike for a bar of soap ."
22128	34	"The privatization of state property proceeded largely through criminal means. Through tricks, fraud, corruption and violence, companies and banks very quickly ""got into the pockets"" of former ""red directors"" and other members of the ""communist"" nomenklatura. In a very short time, billions of fortunes were created in these “founding years” of oligarchic power. Mafiosi helped as diligently as dismissed members of the KGB, army and police. This is how a corrupt and criminal network of former directors, security guards and mafiosi developed, who used bloody methods to further redistribute former state property in the 1990s. The 1990s in Russia were similar to the mafia clashes in Chicago in the 1930s, as can be read from many examples, for example in the books of the murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya. The appropriate term for the resulting system was quickly found: ""nomenklatura capitalism"", a capitalism that had emerged from the division of previous state property among the former ""communist"" nomenklatura.7"
22128	36	Tsars, Stalin, Putin
22128	38	"It's amazing when some on the left see Vladimir Putin, admired by the global far right, as a poor victim of the West, the Putin who, according to Steve Bannon and his far-right US associates, isn't ""woke"" and ""has the balls"" himself to mess with the decadent west. Apparently, leftists defending Putin are prisoners of their own symbolism, as the Putin regime uses Soviet symbols of victory over Hitler's Germany or denazification, especially now in the war against Ukraine. That seems to fit into the left worldview. But it is overlooked that the flags of the Soviet Navy also like to flutter on the masts of Russian billionaire yachts and that the Putin regime uses not only Soviet symbols but also those of tsarism. If you take a sober look, you can see that the nomenklatura-capitalist and authoritarian-nationalist Putin regime uses all the symbols that tell of the “greatness of Russia”. The Soviet Union is openly and unconditionally regarded as what it had become under Stalin: a specific variant of the Greater Russian Empire. That's why Putin hates Lenin so decidedly, who didn't see the Soviet Union as a continuation of the Russian Empire, but as a union of Soviet republics based on the right of peoples to self-determination."
22128	40	"But how does the use of Soviet symbolism go together with the reactionary nationalist practice of the present? Since 2012, and especially since the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution in 2017, the regime has managed to create an ideology of history centered on the narrative of the positive nature of a Greater Russian authoritarian state. In it, a development from the tsars via Stalin to Putin is constructed. Lenin is largely erased from memory, unless he is held responsible for the downfall of the Soviet Russian state in 1989-1991. The times of the Great Russian Revolution are seen as times of turmoil, when both reds and whites wanted what was best for Russia, and which eventually produced the rise of the strong Stalinist state that succeeded the Tsarist Empire. Here Russia had reached its greatest extent and its status as a world power. In this nationalistic way, traditional symbols and cults of the Soviet state, such as those of victory in the Great Patriotic War, can be mixed with symbols of tsarism into a reactionary mixture the size of Russia. The holiday of May 9th is therefore not so much a symbol of remembrance for Russia's victims in the victory over Hitler's Germany and for a ""Never again war!"", but for the strength of Russia today and the possibility of the march to Berlin in the fight against to be able to repeat the West."
22128	42	"So it's no wonder that the censorship authorities themselves have recognized and banned Yevtushenkov's song ""Do you think the Russians want war?"" as a propellant that endangers the state"
22128	44	"Out of consideration for the conservatism of the masses - contrary to some reactionary demands - thanks to Putin even the statues of the ""priest murderer"" Lenin are allowed to remain standing for the time being. Drawing on ideas from Russian Eurasia and other arch-reactionary currents, this ideology is ""anti-Western anti-liberal"" and ethically conservative. She just means ""Russia, but normal"" to modify an election slogan of the AfD. But outwardly this ideology is paired with a belief in Russia's anti-decadent mission and the desire for revenge for the downfall of the former Russian world power called the Soviet Union. Putin's face, contorted with anger when he spoke of the drug addicts in the Ukrainian government, was a genuine expression of this ideology, as was the proclamation of the Moscow Patriarch Cyril that Russia's struggle in Ukraine is fair because it is against judge the existing homosexual rule there."
22128	46	The telling beginning of Putin's political career
22128	48	This reactionary ideology can only surprise anyone who ignores the criminal-capitalist turn of the authoritarian “communist” nomenklatura, which already produced dictatorial features at the beginning of the recapitalization of ex-Soviet state property.
22128	50	"When, at the end of 1993, Russia's path to capitalism appeared politically secure thanks to Yeltsin's use of tanks against the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies in Russia, a delegation of leading German managers went to Russia to sound out investment conditions. During a meeting with the Vice Mayor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin, who was responsible for looking after foreign investors, a remarkable conversation took place, which not only about the then rulers in Russia, about Putin's way of thinking at the beginning of his political career, but also about says something characteristic about German managers. When the camera present at the meeting was switched off, a German general manager asked Mr. Putin whether a military dictatorship based on the Chilean model in Russia was not only being considered in military circles. Mr Putin replied very clearly: ""If you ask... I am in favor of a Pinochet dictatorship in Russia""."
22128	52	"At the end of 1993, the newspaper Neues Deutschland, based on a WDR documentary broadcast a few days later, added the following to the deputy mayor’s remarks: “Putin made a distinction between ‘necessary’ and ‘criminal’ violence. Political violence is criminal if it aims to eliminate free-market conditions, ""necessary"" if it promotes or protects private capital investments. In view of the difficult private-sector path, he, Putin, expressly approves of any preparations by Yeltsin and the military to bring about a dictatorship based on the Pinochet model. Putin's remarks were greeted with friendly applause both by the German company representatives and by the Deputy German Consul General present.”9 The German gentlemen seem to have liked the answer, because everyone, everyone came and invested in Russia, Siemens, VW, Daimler, the chemistry and many more."
22128	54	Putin and the oligarchy
22128	56	As deputy mayor, Putin organized quite successfully corruption-based deals between old business leaders, Western managers or mafiosi with politicians, so a “successful” lunch with Mayor Sobchak could cost over 100,000 US dollars. In any case, the economic situation in the city of St. Petersburg was much more favorable than in the rest of the country, which is why Putin was brought to Moscow by Yeltsin's staff and, after an interlude as head of the FSB, soon became Russia's prime minister.
22128	58	"The oligarchs, whose election campaign owed Yeltsin his re-election and a second term in 1996, unashamedly determined Kremlin policy. To secure their power and assets, they also organized Yeltsin's successor in the presidency if he had to step down in 2000 after two terms of office. Before the end of the electoral term, Yeltsin handed over his office to Putin, who was considered a “reformer” and man of the oligarchs. Immediately began the systematic staging of Putin as a bear-riding and dragon-slaying superhero. Putin used a terrorist attack in Moscow – presumably staged by the secret service – to start the second Chechen war. In doing so, he demonstrated renewed strength and the restoration of Russia's ""honor"" which earned him widespread support in the 2000 presidential election."
22128	60	He received just as much support from the population when Putin took on those who had brought him to power, the oligarchs. He guaranteed them the fortune they had stolen, but only if they did not get involved in politics. This was exemplified by the disempowerment and punishment of the then richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. After he tangled with the president in front of the television cameras because of the corruption in the state apparatus and went into opposition to the president, he was arrested in 2003 and sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005. The accusation was serious fraud and tax evasion with a loss of more than one billion US dollars for the Russian state. His oil company Yukos was divided among state-owned companies.
22128	62	But in the background of this dispute there was also an economic-political conflict, because Putin intended to bring the oil and gas industry back into state ownership, as a branch that is economically and politically strategically important for Russia.
22128	64	"In addition to the oligarchy rooted in the criminal privatization of the 1990s, the rule of the authoritarian presidential system has produced another phenomenon. With Putin, the cadres of the former KGB took control of the oligarchy and created their own oligarchs from their ranks. It was often old friends and confidants of the president who owed him their new wealth. In this way, Putin effectively created a new ""state oligarchy"" alongside and above Yeltsin's ""private oligarchy"". It occupies the most important control centers of the state apparatus, state corporations and economic control and in this way forms a close network of politics and strategically important economic sectors. Through their functions, their relatives also have the opportunity to manage their own pockets. In this respect, it remains even more committed to loyalty to “the Putin system”."
22128	66	The modernization of the economy fails because of the Putin regime
22128	68	The way in which politics and business are closely intertwined has consequences for Russia not only for the development of democracy, but also for long-term economic development. The problem is the political hegemony of two dominant economic blocs in a common, secret service-dominated political power bloc with the president at the center. On the one hand, there is the oil and gas industry, which surpasses all other civilian economic sectors in terms of size and the high degree of monopoly, but also the coal-exploiting and exporting industry. In addition, there is the Military-Industrial Complex (MIK). The monopolistic capital strength of both economic power blocs almost always means that innovative companies emerging alongside them are either bought up or pushed out of the market. The classification and subordination of Russia's great intellectual potential, for example in the IT sector, to the needs of the military and secret services is an eloquent example of the resulting long-term weakening of civilian sectors and thus of the giant country's universal presence on the world market.
22128	70	The modernization of the fossil industry and the MIC at the expense of the duplication and modernization of the rest of the civilian economic structure is the power structure-related limping foot of the entire economic development in Russia. The oil and gas-based, rent-consuming, kleptocratic economic power structure of the Putin regime is therefore itself the best guarantee of Russia’s long-term lag behind its imperialist competitors. Always extremely dependent on the oil and gas price on the world market, it also embodies extremely reactionary interests in domestic and foreign policy in times of global warming.
22128	72	Only the western economic sanctions since 2014 have led to a limited modernization of other branches such as the food industry. In addition, Russia is now one of the largest wheat exporters in the world with a 20 percent share, which does not change the fact that Russia's export structure largely corresponds to the semi-colonial status of a country exporting raw materials and semi-manufactured goods. Since the collapse in oil and gas prices from 2008, wage earners' incomes have stagnated. With renewed neoliberal attacks on wage earners and pensioners, attempts were made to promote the competitiveness of companies and the restructuring of the budget. Thanks to the increase in oil prices over the past three years, however, the corona pandemic has been socially cushioned and the war chest has been filled.
22128	74	Violence instead of modernization
22128	76	The contradiction between Russia as a nuclear superpower and its economic status on the level of Brazil, which Vladimir Putin and those around him recognized as a problem, led to the President's declared goal that Russia should become one of the five largest economic powers in the world by 2035. However, this goal had to be tacitly put on hold. Recent forecasts before the attack on Ukraine say that Russia's economy will stagnate in the long term and in 2035 will be around the same level as today. But by that time, fossil fuel consumption in Europe's main safe buyer countries will have fallen drastically.
22128	78	Vladimir Putin has understood the importance of the time factor in the competition of empires. In a speech to the Russian Valdai Discussion Club in 2021, he explained that in the next few years it will be decided who is the center of the world and who is the periphery. His politics in recent years makes it clear that he and those around him must have recognized that this battle cannot be won in the economic arena. With his ruthless suppression of any domestic opposition, with his massive support for the suppression of the revolts in Belarus and Kazakhstan and his statement in January that Russia would not tolerate any revolution in the post-Soviet space, he was prepared to escalate violence internally like clearly expressed to the outside world.
22128	80	Whether the long-term economic weakness of Russia, for which the character of the Putin regime itself is mainly responsible, formed the final, decisive trigger for the war of aggression against Ukraine against the background of the time factor cannot be definitively answered. However, it can be assumed with some certainty that it was at least an important part of the decision-making process and that it probably fueled the decision to go to war. Because if Russia cannot become an economic superpower in the long run, then violence is the only way to be a superpower. The increasing aggressiveness of the policy of the Putin regime can be explained by the long-term economic weakness on the one hand and the great Russian claim to world power on the other.
22128	82	But not alone! The belief in a historic mission of a great Russian empire towards the “decadent West”, deeply rooted in the Russian ruling class and in Putin himself, always includes Ukraine. Not only for pseudo-historical reasons, but also because, as is well known, Russia without Ukraine is a large country, but not an empire. But the imperial dream is far greater...
22128	84	Putin's assertion that the violent annexation and colonization of the Baltic countries by the Soviet Union in the wake of the Hitler-Stalin pact took place in accordance with valid international law also applies to all other peoples of the Russian-Soviet prison of nations who, like Moldava (the tsarist and Romanian-speaking Besarabia stolen from Stalin) or made Georgia independent from Russia in 1991, don't bode well. In addition, Putin's aide, Dmitry Medvedev, announced when he was president that Russia had the right to intervene wherever ethnic Russians lived. And that applies to all former Soviet republics, including those that are now members of the EU and NATO.
22128	86	The draft treaties submitted by Russia to the USA and NATO in December 2021, which demanded the reversal of NATO in Eastern Europe, indicate more than clearly that Russia is also seeking renewed control over countries of the former Warsaw Treaty in Eastern Europe. The revisionist ambitions of Russian neo-imperialism have the potential for more wars. But they are also reasons for the fear-driven flight of these countries under the wing of the United States and the West. The limited possibilities for the Putin regime to achieve its political goals in “nearby foreign countries” and in Eastern Europe through economic or even cultural hegemony and its fear of mass movements make this regime so aggressive and dangerous.
22129	3	The West has decided to deal another blow to Russia's revenues and ban gold exports. Four countries - Great Britain, the USA, Canada and Japan - have announced such an embargo. Germany and France showed support for these sanctions, which were the result of the G7 meeting. However, they cannot adopt them on their own as they have to discuss the issue with other EU members. Most likely, the EU's imposition of a gold embargo on Russia is just a matter of the time it takes to complete the formalities.
22129	5	"US President Joe Biden assures that this will be a heavy blow to Russia's foreign trade. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken says it concerns ""the second most lucrative export item Russia has after energy"". Blinken estimates that the G7 countries' ban on gold imports from Russia would cost the country $19 billion a year in revenue."
22129	7	"According to data from 2021, Russia sold 301 tons to foreign markets at current prices worth $19 billion. According to analysts at Freedom Finance, most of Russia's gold - 90 percent - was bought by the UK last year for $15.4 billion (as London is the largest trading center for precious metals alongside New York). Also in Europe, Russian gold was purchased by Switzerland for $422 million and Germany for $318 million. In addition, gold with a total value of $1.134 billion was bought from other importers from ""friendly"" countries."
22129	9	It is interesting that the collective West has so vociferously announced a new crackdown on Russian revenues, when in fact the trading ban on Russian gold in London dates back to March 2022.
22129	11	This happened when the London Precious Metals Association revoked the international certification of Russian gold bullion when the bullion was stamped as conforming to the sample and admitted to the international market. Since then we have not shipped any gold bars to Europe, Canada or the USA,
22129	13	says Alexei Vyazovsky, Vice President of Gold Coin House.
22129	15	So why have the G7 countries made such a fuss about formally imposing sanctions?
22129	17	"First, it is an opportunity to add weight to the G7 meeting. It would be a ""shame"" for the politicians not to mention the issue of Russia and not to punish Russia in any way. And finding a new punishment that is loud but doesn't further destroy the economies of developed countries is no longer that easy."
22129	19	"Second, it could be a smart move to punish other countries. ""It is possible that such a statement was made at the G7 level in order to put other countries under secondary sanctions,"" Vyazovsky does not rule out."
22129	21	Given the formality of the official sanctions, the blow to Russia may not be as serious as the US is trying to portray.
22129	23	"For one thing, the revenue from gold exports is actually substantial. Russia even earns less from arms exports - $13 billion in 2020. And yet, measured against total earnings, this is not a critical share. Even the export of agro-industrial products adds up to a much more significant amount of money - in 2021 it was $34 billion. And Russia's total export earnings last year amounted to $498 billion. ""In 2021, household revenue from gold exports was about 7.57 percent, this year it would be about 5.35 percent, taking into account changes in the dollar exchange rate,"" Freedom Finance analysts calculated."
22129	25	In addition, Russia has every chance of diverting gold exports from the west to the east. Vyazovsky:
22129	27	Russia is already seeing an upturn in gold trading with the United Arab Emirates. We are now delivering bulk gold bars to Dubai. India and China will soon join them.
22129	29	Dubai has probably become a trading hub for Russia's gold, where it can be bought by anyone who wants it.
22129	31	The expert draws a parallel with the sale of Russian oil, where India has suddenly become the main buyer. Indians buy Russian oil at a discount of about $30 on the world market price and can then use it for their own needs or resell it to others at the market price and make money off it.
22129	33	Vyazovsky is confident that India and China - the two largest consumers of gold - will also become active buyers of Russian gold, as will the UAE:
22129	35	The destruction of global trade is taking place before our eyes. Even China is concerned and has started selling its dollar reserves because it understands that, should anything happen, those too can easily be blocked. And the gold is stored at home, it is not threatened by anything. Second, India and China are the main producers and consumers of jewelry.
22129	37	"Therefore, Russian gold will find a new buyer, most likely on the other side of the ""barricades""."
22129	39	In today's world, it's actually very difficult to ban anything. Russia accounts for almost ten percent of global gold production. Gold is a liquid currency. Once the money stops working, the gold will keep going. The water will always find a way
22129	41	sums up the Vice President of Golden Mint confidently.
22129	43	Dmitry Pukhkarev, a stock market expert at BCS World Investments, points to other opportunities:
22129	45	Another way to mitigate the impact on the gold industry is to bolster central bank reserves through increased gold purchases. If the regulator decides to increase gold purchases in the domestic market, it could provide strong support to the industry.
22129	47	"If the government reintroduces the ""fiscal rule,"" it would be logical to use the oil and gas deals (and prices are still rising) to buy gold and yuan instead of the ""inaccessible"" dollars and euros."
22129	49	As for the price of gold, there is no definite answer here as to whether prices will rise in light of the official ban. First, the announced embargo of the G7 countries is more of a formality and symbolic. Second, there are suspicions that gold prices are now being artificially dampened. Alexey Vyazovsky on this:
22129	51	"In 2020, a historic record of almost $2,000 per troy ounce was set. We are near him now. However, it is obvious that the price of gold is being manipulated by central banks in developed countries. There is a tacit understanding not to allow gold to rise above a certain level lest it become a competitor to the fiat currencies that central banks in developed countries can print in unlimited quantities. Once that level is reached, they sell gold en masse from their vaults, which pushes the price down.
22129 53 In addition, manipulations of ""paper"" gold are possible - derivatives, futures, etc. I am skeptical about these manipulations, but time will tell how long they will be able to cheat the market. However, they will not be able to cheat forever ."""
22129	55	Predicting the price of gold is therefore quite difficult:
22129	57	Theoretically, if we assume that the Central Bank of Russia announces the conversion of oil dollars, or in general all trades, to gold, prices will take off like a rocket, up to $7,000 or even $10,000 per ounce. And that won't be the limit, Vyazovsky says.
22129	59	As for domestic demand, the Russian government has eliminated the 13 percent income tax and 20 percent sales tax on bullion sales by the end of 2023, allowing people to invest their savings in gold.
22129	61	A boom in buying physical gold by the population was seen in March when VAT was abolished. A second followed after the income tax was abolished, but now no new demand can be observed, according to Freedom Finance.
22129	63	Turnover in the sale of gold bars has increased, but it cannot be said that there has been a large increase. A lot has been done, but there is still a lot to do. For example, legal entities are not allowed to trade in gold. Private individuals cannot trade among themselves either. You can only sell the bars to banks, and they are very reluctant to buy them back, requiring expert verification, etc. There is still a lot of work to be done in this direction,
22129	65	Vyazowski warns.
22129	67	It should be remembered that gold miners already have a choice to sell abroad or to the Central Bank of Russia. First, however, the Russian central bank buys gold at a discount of 15 percent on the market price. Second, she pays in rubles. However, the miners have to repay foreign currency loans and buy imported equipment, so they need foreign exchange earnings.
22129	69	Gold miners may initially find it difficult to restructure their business focused on London, the center of the world's gold trade.
22129	71	Sanctions on gold could prove sensitive to the industry because most of the metal mined in Russia -- more than 80 percent in 2021 -- is exported, Pukhkarev said. According to him, all Russian gold miners may be forced to sell gold at a discount, he said. Polyus would be in a better position as the share of export earnings in 2021 was less than two percent. On the other hand, in 2012 Polymetal achieved about twelve percent of its revenues from exports to the EU and a total of 56 percent from sales outside of Russia.
22129	73	The most important foreign market was Kazakhstan with 35 percent of the total income. It is still unclear how Kazakhstan will react to the imposition of sanctions by the G7 countries and possibly the EU. On the other hand, according to Pukkarev, the impact of the sanctions could be mitigated by the fact that Polymetal has diversified its production into silver.
22129	75	Russia's fourth largest gold mine, the Petropavlovsk company, is already struggling. In mid-May, the company failed to pay $12.36 million in debt on dollar-denominated Eurobonds on time. Earlier, the company failed to repay a loan to Gazprombank. The thing is, the gold miner is registered in the UK but had a loan with Gazprombank, which was placed on the UK sanctions list at the end of March. As a result, Petropavlovsk was unable to transfer funds to a Russian bank to repay the loan.

2213	1	NATO alone at home
2213	3	If we don't buy Russian oil, it will go bad and Putin will have to dump it. As far as Leonore Gewessler from the Greens (who else). The Russian is angry and lost without our money.
2213	5	Of course, it's also possible that the Chinese will buy it instead. The Brazilians. Or the South Africans. The Thais. Because the countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia are largely identical to NATO (without Turkey!) plus their Pacific allies South Korea, Taiwan and Japan (although there are only sanctions there).
2213	7	Central & Latin America, Africa, Asia, the overwhelming majority of the planet is not participating in the NATO (represented by Ukraine) war against Russia. Either they all belong to the Russians, which would surprise me when it comes to NATO members Turkey or Israel. As well as the largest democracy in the world, India. Or the story our government media tells us only shows one side of the coin. Is propaganda. Disinformation.
2213	9	Because the story of the war of evil Russia, dictatorial and corrupt, against the morally superior Ukraine, democratic and good, it is not so unambiguous. There has been a war in Ukraine for a long time, but nobody has ever been interested.
2213	11	In July 2019, a member of Ukraine's Kultchytskyi battalion, Vitaly Markiv, was sentenced in Italy to 24 years in prison for murder. He had shot the Italian photographer Andrea Rocchelli in the Donbass, near the city of Sloviansk. His Russian translator was also killed. Rocchelli had documented the life of the civilian population in Donbass (and was posthumously called a terrorist by Azov supporters). The images show the same misery that is now being presented to us by the government media. Only at that time Russian-speaking Ukrainians were the victims, so NATO and the West didn't give a damn.
2213	13	"Killings of civilians by Ukrainian military or ""volunteer battalions"" are also now occurring. Still. When on March 1, 2022 Volodymyr Struk, the mayor of the city of Kreminna, was kidnapped and shot by men in camouflage, the Ukrainian government official Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, commented with the words ""one less traitor in Ukraine"". Struk wasn't anti-Russian enough."
2213	15	This is expressly not intended to play down or justify the actions of the Russian military.
2213	17	I just want to show that the black and white story of the fight between good and evil is not true. Our democracy is not being defended in Ukraine either; it is a thoroughly corrupt oligarchy that has been waging civil war against part of its population for years. And now in conflict with a more powerful oligarchy. The interests of the Ukrainian oligarchs are not worth the risk of nuclear war. Or the destruction of the European economy and with it the livelihood of the population.
2213	19	A NATO proxy war against Russia on their soil does not help the people of Ukraine either. They pay for these power games with their lives. In my opinion, the only solution is to cede the predominantly Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine and Crimea to Russia and make western Ukraine neutral on the Swiss model.
2213	21	By the way, I'm not anti-gun. I am even in favor of arming ourselves very robustly. To avoid conflict, potential aggressors should know what to expect. But when a conflict has broken out, it should be ended as quickly as possible. Despite NATO support, a total victory for Ukraine is unlikely. A negotiated solution remains. So why should more people die before this solution is found?
2213	23	But the Ukraine war is wonderfully suited to distract from a reappraisal of the Corona “measures” and the deadly side effects of the syringe that are emerging. Or the planned social credit systems, which will be as voluntary as participating in the corona injection and whose currency will be obedience.
22131	1	Former British Chief of Staff General Richard Dannatt: Donbass will be Russian forever
22131	3	"Former British Chief of Staff General Richard Dannatt expressed confidence that Russian forces would inevitably occupy the DNR and LNR and that the Ukrainians would not be able to ""drive"" them from there."
22132	3	Experts have warned of a drastic global rise in oil prices, Canadian business news channel BNN Bloomberg reported. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said prices could reach as much as $380 a barrel - almost four times the current level - should Moscow decide to cooperate with sanctions imposed by the United States and European countries to respond to countermeasures such as stopping production or exports.
22132	5	Currently, the member states of the G7 are working on a complicated procedure to limit the revenues that Moscow can earn from oil from Russian production. In doing so, they want to attack Moscow's revenues and thus its ability to finance the Russian military. However, in a report to JPMorgan Chase clients, analyst Natasha Kaneva warned that Moscow's financial situation is so stable that the Russian government can afford to cut daily oil production by up to five million barrels without causing major damage to people having to worry about their own economy.
22132	7	The economists also warned that such a rise in prices would have catastrophic consequences for the rest of the world. If Russia cuts its oil production by 3 million barrels, that would send prices to US$190, while in the worst case – that is, if production falls by 5 million barrels a day – prices could even climb to US$380.
22132	9	The analysts wrote:
22132	11	The most obvious and likely risk with a price cap is that Russia could choose not to go along with it and instead retaliate by cutting exports. It's likely that the government could retaliate by cutting production to inflict pain on the West. The tense situation on the global oil market is in Russia's favour.

22133	1	Macron: Destroying Russia 'not the goal'
22133	3	"Earlier this month, the French channel France 2 aired the documentary entitled ""Un président, l'Europe et la guerre"" (""A President, Europe and the War""), which examines Emmanuel Macron's foreign policy and in particular his negotiations with the Russian Presidents lit. It was directed by French journalist Guy Lagache, who has followed Macron and his team for the past six months."
22133	5	"In a scene where the French leader is returning from Kyiv on a train, he said talks with Vladimir Putin were necessary to prevent the conflict in Ukraine from escalating further. Macron condemned Anglo-Saxon politicians for openly expressing their desire to destroy Russia. This is not the goal, according to Macron, instead one must ""help Ukraine to win"" and ""not fight against Russia, let alone destroy it""."
22133	7	Macron had previously been criticized by several heads of state and government for staying in touch with the Russian president. While condemning the war in Ukraine and backing EU sanctions against Moscow, the French President had spoken to Vladimir Putin several times on the phone since February. Those calls didn't seem to bring Ukraine any closer to peace, but Macron drew censure from Kiev supporters. For example, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused Macron of speaking to a man he compared to Hitler.
22133	9	"Despite the practical similarity between Macron's approach and that of his US and UK counterparts, all of whom supply arms and ammunition to Kyiv, there is a clear difference in rhetoric between France and the Anglo-Saxon world. While US President Joe Biden accused Russia of committing “genocide” in Ukraine, Macron warned the West not to grapple with such loaded terms. He has also rejected calls from Kyiv to declare Russia a ""sponsor of terrorism"". And while US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called the conflict in Ukraine an opportunity to ""leave Russia weakened,"" Macron said the West must not humiliate Russia to one day facilitate a peace deal."
22133	11	"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson compared Putin to a crocodile and repeatedly rejected the idea of ​​peace talks with Moscow. Macron, on the other hand, said that European politicians must ""respect Russia as a country and as a Russian people"". He argues that ""there will be no lasting peace"" unless Russia advocates an architecture of peace on the European continent."
22133	13	"Nonetheless, Macron sided with his G7 colleagues and said he was ready to support Ukraine's military ""for as long as necessary"". After dismissing rumors that he had allegedly suggested Ukraine trade land for peace with Russia, Macron now insists that ""Ukraine will decide when the conditions are met to make peace""."
22133	15	"Russian President Vladimir Putin has in recent weeks accused European politicians of sacrificing their own economies, claiming that under pressure from their American overlord they are ""committing economic suicide""."

22134	1	Russia continues to find buyers for its oil
22134	3	Western oil sanctions proves an own goal
22134	5	Whoever came up with the sanctions in the Zelensky worship group known as the EU, one thing is certain: it's not a particularly intelligent strategy. Let's look at the oil. It should no longer be imported from the West, with Washington, London and Brussels wanting to cut off one of Moscow's most important lifelines. The USA and Canada have issued import bans on Russian oil. Great Britain wants to give up oil from Russia by the end of 2022. The EU's sixth package of sanctions also stipulates that oil imports from Russia will be phased out by the end of the year. Nevertheless, Moscow exports more crude oil than it has in a long time.
22134	7	The shot backfires: Russia is shipping more crude oil than before. It turns out that Russian oil is still finding its buyers, because Asian countries are buying more Russian oil by sea than before the invasion of Ukraine. Long distances for delivery are also worthwhile.
22134	9	According to data from the Finnish non-governmental organization Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), in the first 100 days since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia earned around 46 billion euros from the export of crude oil and a good 93 billion euros from the export of all fossil fuels.
22134	11	Crude oil shipped from Russia by sea in April and May was 3.3 million barrels per day. This is as high as it was last time in June 2019. Imports in north-western Europe have fallen sharply. However, this is more than offset by increased Russian exports to southern and south-eastern Europe, India, China and Turkey.
22134	13	Why is that? The current buyers see one major advantage in particular: Russian oil is cheap. Russian Urals crude oil is more than $34 a barrel cheaper than Brent oil from the Baltic Sea. The reference price for the global oil market is based on this. This means that Urals costs a good 30 percent less than Brent. Usually the price difference is much smaller. In addition, oil supply is currently tight and refining margins are high. It's simple: buying Russian oil is worthwhile in many cases.
22134	15	And Russia profits excessively from it. Even if the export volume of crude oil and petroleum products has fallen at times: Due to the sharp rise in the world market price for petroleum, Russia earned more in May 2022 than a year earlier, as an analysis by Crea shows.
22134	17	India in particular is proving to be a good customer of the Kremlin: the Indian refineries are taking almost one percent of Russian crude oil exports before February 24, according to Crea, by May 2022 it will be a whopping 18 percent. An important buyer is the world's largest refinery, Jamnagar, on India's west coast. In May, around 27 percent of deliveries came from Russia, compared to just five percent a month earlier.
22134	19	Conclusion: Russian oil supplies to India have increased more than sevenfold since the invasion of Ukraine. But the country that buys the most Russian oil remains China. Around 800,000 barrels per day are transported by pipeline. Chinese companies are now increasing shipments by ship.
22134	21	This development has not escaped the attention of the EU countries either. But the West faces a dilemma: if the sanctions come late and are weak, they will be ineffective. If the measures take effect, however, the world market price for oil will rise, which will ultimately be felt by companies and citizens at the gas station.
22135	1	Secret NATO report via Wikileaks showed miserable Russian forces, push for tactical nuclear weapons
22135	3	"In 2009, a total of 33,000 Russian soldiers trained in the maneuvers ""Ladoga 2009"" and ""Zapad 2009"", but things turned into a complete fiasco: nothing worked as hoped and one was only capable of relatively small skirmishes without the use of smaller, so-called ""tactical"" nuclear weapons."
22135	5	Wikileaks released NATO's classified assessment:
22135	7	"""The exercise demonstrated that Russia has limited capabilities for joint operations with the Air Force and remains dependent on aging and deficient equipment."""
22135	9	"Exactly these weak points were now also evident in Ukraine in 2022, where, according to the standard procedure for an invasion, an extensive air force campaign in cooperation with the ground forces was expected. As soon as the ""air supremacy"" is reached, almost every target of the enemy can be shot at. Instead, there was little to see of the Russian planes and certainly no great coordination, as is constantly practiced by the USA, for example."
22135	11	"According to the NATO report, the Russians “were not able to operate in all weathers, there is a lack of strategic transport capacities”. Logistics was still a disaster in Ukraine in 2022. Russia was ""unable to respond to two smaller conflicts in different places at the same time"" and was ""incapable of large conventional operations""."
22135	13	In 2014, Ukrainian companies stopped producing armaments because of an export embargo. Although Russia managed to take Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine back then, in 2022 you could see that only 200,000 men were mobilized to take a country the size of France. Ammo depots are pretty empty and post-production is slow.
22135	15	"The NATO observers noted that ""Russia remains dependent on the use of tactical nuclear weapons, even in local and regional conflicts."" The Russian exercise in the Leningrad area was aimed at repelling a simulated attack from Poland and Lithuania, also using tactical nuclear weapons. Of course, the idea of ​​Poland and Lithuania attacking Russia is absolutely ridiculous."
22135	17	"Estonia was quite concerned, referring to top-secret NATO document MC-161, according to which ""Russia will continue to test the credibility and cohesion of the alliance."""
22135	19	Weird dispatches
22135	21	"In 2010, Wikileaks published a mountain of secret embassy cables from which one can infer that the Americans were desperate for a ""fresh start"" in relations with Russia. The protest from states like Poland were blocked."
22135	23	“Russian media and officials are concerned about comments by Polish [Foreign Minister] Radoslaw Sikorski on November 4 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,”
22135	25	says the cable.
22135	27	"""They were particularly offended by Sikorski's request that US forces be on the ground in Poland to 'protect against Russian aggression.'"""
22135	29	It is now taken for granted that the US will increase its military presence in Poland. The neo-Stalinist ideology and Russia's military offensive in Georgia are big question marks, said Sikorski. It was questionable how the US would fulfill its obligation to defend NATO members under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.
22135	31	"""There's the recent exercise, subtly named Zapad-2009, on the Polish border, the largest Russian military exercise on the NATO border since the fall of communism, involving 900 tanks and launching three medium-range nuclear-capable tactical missiles,"""
22135	33	said Sikorsky. NATO stated that Russia's military was too weak for large-scale conventional warfare, but the nuclear option remained. However, it is unlikely that the USA will defend Poland with nuclear weapons, because the defense alliance has core members and second-class members. Sikorski therefore saw the danger that Poland would become a pawn, with the Americans writing off the country as a loss in an emergency.
22135	35	"""NATO planners always said that God made Poland for tank warfare,"" he said. “These tanks that were training were 250 kilometers of flat terrain from our capital. ..."
22135	37	"""As Zbig Brzezinski said (and he wasn't the only one): what really reassured Germany, for example, during the Cold War was not Article 5, which is notoriously quite vague, but the presence of 300,000 American soldiers in Germany,"" Mr. Sikorski said ."
22136	1	Archbishop Viganò: Rulers want the peoples to be wiped out!
22136	3	By JÖRG WOLLSCHLÄGER | In an interview with the journalistic pioneer Steve Bannon, the fearless fighter Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò speaks of an ontologically-related failure of the Great Reset, as it was inspired by inhuman and devilish principles. We must oppose the godless model of a dystopian society with honesty, loyalty, sincerity and fear of God, he calls! He calls the current church leaders heretics and traitors.
22136	5	Your Excellency, after the psychopandemic, we now have the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. Are we in “phase two” of a single project, or can we now call the Covid farce over and deal with the rise in energy prices?
22136	7	Had we been dealing with a true pandemic over the past two years, caused by a deadly virus for which there was no cure other than a vaccine, we might believe the emergency was unintentional. But that is not the case: the SARS-CoV-2 virus is nothing more than a seasonal flu that could have been cured with the existing treatment methods and effective prevention based on strengthening the immune system. Banning treatments, discrediting the effectiveness of drugs that have been used for decades, the decision to place elderly who have fallen ill in nursing homes, and the introduction of experimental gene therapy that has proven not only ineffective but harmful and often deadly - all of this confirms to us that the pandemic was planned and managed with the aim of causing the greatest possible damage. This is a fact established and confirmed by the official data, although these data have been systematically falsified.
22136	9	Certainly those who wanted to manage the pandemic in this way are not ready to give in easily now, in part because there are multi-billion dollar interests behind all of this. But what “they” want does not always have to happen.
22136	11	Same response to pandemic worldwide
22136	13	In your opinion, was the pandemic handled in this way out of inexperience, Your Excellency? Or was it due to the corruption of those responsible who are in a conflict of interest because they are paid by the pharmaceutical industry?
22136	15	"This is the second element to consider: the response to the pandemic has been the same across the world: health authorities slavishly conformed to health protocols that ran counter to the scientific literature and medical evidence, and instead followed the directives of self-proclaimed ones ""Experts"" known for their sensational failures, their apocalyptic, utterly unrealistic predictions, and their grave conflicts of interest. We cannot believe that millions of doctors around the world have lost their basic medical knowledge and believe that you should let the flu grow into pneumonia and then treat it with tachypirin or put the patient on a ventilator. If they did so, it was because of the pressure - to the point of blackmail - by the health authorities on medical workers, with the help of a scandalous campaign of media terrorism, and with the support of Western leaders. Most of these leaders are members of a lobby - the World Economic Forum - which has trained them and placed them at the highest levels of national and international institutions to ensure that those in power are compliant. Klaus Schwab has publicly boasted on many occasions that he is able to intervene even with religious leaders. These are also documented facts in all the countries that have followed the instructions of the WHO and the pharmaceutical companies. There is clearly a single script under a single direction: this proves the existence of a criminal plan and the evil of its creators."
22136	17	Silent coup since the 1990s
22136	19	"In some of your other statements you have spoken of a ""golpe bianco"" (a ""silent putsch"")."
22136	21	"A ""silent coup"" is a coup d'état that takes place without the use of force and is carried out by a government that exercises its power in an unconstitutional manner."
22136	23	"In this case, the coup was carried out almost simultaneously in all Western countries, beginning in the early 1990s. In Italy, this coup began with the divestment of companies in which investments had been made and the privatization of services that normally drained the treasury, such as health and transport, on the orders of high finance, which Mario Draghi ordered on 2 April 1941. June 1992 on the yacht Britannia. Yes, Mario Draghi, who was then Director General of the Treasury and whom the then President of the Italian Republic, Francesco Cossiga, called a ""cowardly businessman"". In other countries, this overthrow took place in an analogous manner, with a series of gradual transfers of sovereignty to supranational bodies such as the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With the introduction of the euro, monetary sovereignty was withdrawn from the states that joined the Maastricht Treaty and transferred to the European Central Bank, which is a private bank. This bank decides the interest rate at which it finances the national budgets, with the money that the same countries have already given it. In practice, the European Central Bank charges interest on money it gives back a penny at a time, and only under certain conditions: reforms, cuts in public spending, the introduction of laws promoting gender equality, abortion rights, indoctrination of children, etc. The introduction of a balanced budget into the constitution - as if the state were a corporation - was also part of the silent coup."
22136	25	All members of these bodies, including the same rulers who were appointed on the recommendation of unelected powers or who managed to win elections thanks to the manipulation of information, are at the same time servants of big finance corporations or big investment funds - some were their employees, like Goldman Sachs' Draghi - others became employees after the end of their tenure. Just as drug regulators and health organizations are made up of former BigPharma employees, who are often given consulting contracts and paid by the very drug companies they are supposed to be keeping an eye on.
22136	27	"Until the pandemic, in practice, at least formally, power was still held by individual states and laws were passed by parliaments. But for two years, parliaments have been disempowered, and those who managed to put the World Economic Forum and other lobbies at the top of governments and international institutions have begun to legislate against the constitution and the interests of the nation, you obey the orders given to them from above - ""by the markets"" as they tell us - which are in fact made up of a very small number of multinationals that are engulfing competing companies that combine professional skills with damaging the quality of the product destroy and reduce workers' protections and wages thanks to the complicity of the unions and the left."
22136	29	In short, we are ruled by a high command of usurers and speculators, from Bill Gates investing in big business on the eve of the food crisis or in vaccines on the eve of the pandemic, to George Soros dealing with currency and government bond swings speculated and, together with Hunter Biden, financed a bio-laboratory in Ukraine.
22136	31	To believe that there is no connection between the instigators of these crimes and those who carry them out at the highest levels of national governments, the EU and the UN is a sign of suspicion, because even a child could understand that we are talking about a group of ideologically deviant and morally corrupt technocrats being held hostage. The peoples of the world must reclaim their sovereignty, which has been usurped by the globalist elite.
22136	33	Rulers want the peoples to be wiped out
22136	35	The instigators of this crime proudly show up at the Davos Forum, at the meetings of the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Group together with the rulers, the prime ministers, the directors of newspapers and television channels, the CEOs of social bankers and the directors of social platforms and multinational corporations, the bankers and the directors of rating agencies, the presidents of foundations and self-proclaimed philanthropists. They all share the same agenda - which they post on their websites - and are so confident in their own power that they affirm with impunity - as Soros and Schwab recently did - that there is a need to create a narrative that goes beyond the mainstream media to make their decisions acceptable to the people. Censorship and mass manipulation are used by them as an instrumentum regni, and we have seen this in both the pandemic farce and the pro-Zelensky propaganda in Ukraine.
22136	37	We must understand that our rulers are traitors to our nation, dedicated to the annihilation of the population, and that all their actions are aimed at causing maximum harm to the citizens. This is not a problem of inexperience or incompetence, but of intentio nocendi - the willful intent to harm. Honest citizens find it inconceivable that those who rule them do so with the perverse intent of undermining and destroying them, making it difficult for them to believe it. The root cause of this serious problem lies in the corruption of authority and the resigned obedience of the governed.
22136	39	Church leaders heretics and traitors
22136	41	"The Catholic Church, too, has experienced the same cognitive dissonance, beginning with the Second Vatican Council revolution and especially during the final nine years of the Bergoglian “pontificate”: the faithful and the clergy have resigned themselves to obeying mere cynical officials— no less corrupt and perverted than their deep state counterparts - although it was evident that the aim of the alleged ""reforms"" was always the systematic destruction of the Church by its highest leaders, who are heretics and traitors. And I find that the Deep Church has resorted to the same false arguments to obscure the doctrinal, moral and liturgical dissolution: first of all, the false claim that these reforms were demanded ""from the ground up"" and not imposed by force from above. Just as the reforms planned by the World Economic Forum, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilaterals are adopted by their infiltrators at the highest levels of nations and international organizations and appear to have their plans ratified by popular approval."
22136	43	Distinguish between obedience and submission
22136	45	And what is your advice, Your Excellency, to get out of this impasse?
22136	47	Respect for authority is innate in civilized man, but it is necessary to distinguish between obedience and submission. You see, every virtue consists of the just mean between two opposite vices, without being a compromise, but also, so to speak, as the summit between two valleys. Disobedience sins by falling short, by not wanting to submit to a good command from a legitimate authority; Submissiveness, on the other hand, sins excessively, submitting to orders that are unjust or given by an illegitimate authority. The good citizen should know how to disobey civil authority, and the good Catholic should do the same with ecclesiastical authority, disobeying when authority demands obedience to an unjust ordinance.
22136	49	Earthly authority always subordinate to the royal authority of the Lord
22136	51	Doesn't this talk seem a bit revolutionary to you, Excellency?
22136	53	Not even close. The anarchists and the courtiers both have a distorted notion of authority: some deny it, others idolize it. The just means is the only morally practicable way, because it corresponds to the order which the Lord has imposed on the world and which the heavenly hierarchy respects. We owe obedience to legitimate authority to the extent that it exercises its power for the purposes for which it was appointed by God: the temporal good of the citizen in the case of the state, and the spiritual good of the believer in the case of the church. An authority that inflicts evil on its subjects is therefore illegitimate and its orders are void. Let us not forget that the true Lord, from whom all authority emanates, is God, and that authority on earth—both civil and spiritual—is always representative, that is, subordinate to the authority of Jesus Christ, the King and High Priest , is subordinate. Substituting the vicarious authority of rulers for the royal authority of the Lord is a crazy gesture and—yes—revolutionary and rebellious.
22136	55	Elite wants to establish totalitarian regime through high treason and subversion
22136	57	What does the elite want to achieve? It promises us peace, security, prosperity and jobs, but at the moment there are more than fifty armed conflicts in the world; our cities are uninhabitable, filled with criminals, decayed and ruled by dissident minorities.
22136	59	This is the third undeniable element that cannot be overlooked: the pandemic was conceived as a tool to establish a totalitarian regime, conceived by unelected technocrats with no sense of democratic representation.
22136	61	The same is happening with the Ukraine crisis: the majority of citizens are absolutely not in favor of sending arms to Ukraine and imposing sanctions on the Russian Federation, and yet the leaders act as if they have the full support of their own nations, aided by embarrassing distortions of reality by the mainstream media. And in some countries, such as Italy, this is happening in a situation of worrying complicity by all the powers of state, both in legitimizing violations of fundamental rights under the anti-Covid regulations and in ratifying involvement in a conflict, although the Italian Parliament has never discussed the entering into this conflict, which even the President of the Republic, guarantor of the Constitution, approves and encourages, to the applause of European technocrats. In this case, too, the rulers do not obey the will of the people and do not pursue the common good, but follow orders given to them by supranational entities with their own, well-known, subversive interests.
22136	63	"When they speak of the ""conversion of goods into services"" and of the ""sharing economy"" through the digital sector, they want to dispossess citizens of their private property: ""You will not own anything and you will be happy."" By privatizing government goods or services, they want to appropriate the profits while leaving the costs on the community's shoulders. But since not all countries are ready to go along with this ""reset"", they force them to do so by provoking economic crises, pandemics and wars. This is high treason and subversion."
22136	65	"The premeditated nature of this overthrow is evident, as is the awareness of the catastrophic consequences of the social, economic and public health decisions taken in relation to both the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Bergoglio has also admitted it: months before Putin's military operation in Ukraine, a head of state revealed to him that NATO and the European Union are deliberately provoking the Russian Federation after years of supporting Kyiv's ethnic cleansing of the Russian-speaking minority in Donbass and on the ignored Crimea. The aim of this provocation was to ignite a conflict that would serve as a pretext to legitimize the imposition of sanctions on the Russian Federation and force Western states to initiate the ""green transition"". At the same time, the economies of nations should suffer to the benefit of a few international investment funds and market speculation. In essence, the same premises are used to justify the Enclosure Acts in England and later the Holodomor in Ukraine, in order to turn the peasant masses into cheap labor for the industrialization of the big cities. To avoid war, NATO should not have been expanded in violation of the treaty, and protection of Ukraine's Russian-speaking minority should have been guaranteed, as required by the 2014 Minsk Protocol."
22136	67	If they didn't, it's because the real purpose they were trying to achieve has nothing to do with the apparent purpose they publicly proclaimed. And I realize that these are not abstract speculations, but concrete facts that were foreseen and planned decades ago by the Great Reset theorists to force a societal change that no one wants, and the economy and to restart the finance system of the Western world from scratch - like rebooting a computer.
22136	69	The fact that this leads to misery, bankruptcy, business failure, unemployment, social instability and the widening gap between rich and poor, declining birth rate and depletion of essential services is considered a negligible detail, with it being the only and Its sole purpose is to indoctrinate the masses with false arguments advocating war or control over every detail of people's lives, with anyone who disagrees being criminalized and portrayed as an enemy of the people. It seems to me that this narrative is drowning under the weight of the lies of the elite and their accomplices.
22136	71	Social engineering through immigration and interbreeding
22136	73	Could you give us an example, Your Excellency?
22136	75	The most obvious example is the discovery that Richard Kalergi, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, wanted to pursue a policy of social engineering aimed at transforming European national societies through immigration and interbreeding, by combining the waves of migration with the attractiveness of cheaper labor propelled. The vicious obstinacy with which waves of illegal immigrants continue to be welcomed, even when the impact of this phenomenon on urban security, overall crime rates and the identity of national populations are evident, shows that the original plan has largely been realized and that Measures must be taken to prevent it from being completed.
22136	77	But these are not random events: they told us so.
22136	79	"You are absolutely right: What amazes me is the audacity with which the proponents of the 2030 Agenda have told us long in advance what criminal projects they want to force on us against our will; despite this evidence, there are those who marvel that after years of unstoppable infiltration, they are actually carrying out their plans before our eyes while accusing us of being ""conspiracy theorists"". There is definitely a conspiracy, but those who need to be brought to justice are those who carried them out, not those who denounce them."
22136	81	Joe Biden blames Vladimir Putin for the crisis. Do you agree with this assessment?
22136	83	Americans are well aware that the price of gasoline rose long before the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and continued to rise due to sanctions – actual or alleged – imposed by the international community on the Russian Federation. Today we know that the sanctions - as was predictable - did not affect Putin in the slightest, but the motive behind them is that they were intended to hit the western nations and especially the European nations to provoke an economic and energy crisis that would endanger the ecological conversion, rations, population control and censorship of information should be legitimized.
22136	85	Putin has not fallen for deep state provocations, limiting himself to intervening only as far as necessary to provide security and protection for the Russian-speaking Donbass. And he stormed the Azovstal Steel Plant, which housed one of the secret American bio-laboratories that produced bacteriological weapons and conducted experiments on SARS-CoV‑2. On the other hand, the Biden family had a keen interest in waging a war in Ukraine to cover up the corruption cases Hunter Biden was involved in and to distract from the looming scandals targeting Obama and Hillary Clinton over Russiagate and against sign off on the deep state over voter fraud against Trump.
22136	87	"The US proxy war against the Russian invasion is actually a deep state war against a nation that has refused to be co-opted by the delusions of globalist technocrats and that today has evidence of deep state crimes. But while the EU can blackmail European nations by tying disbursements of funds and lending rates to the implementation of ""reforms"" - as these nations enjoy limited monetary and fiscal sovereignty - the same cannot be said of Russia, one thing sovereign and independent nation and self-sufficient in raw materials, energy and agricultural food."
22136	89	The Hegemonic Left
22136	91	Is this bipolar vision, which revisits the Cold War confrontation between the US and the USSR, no longer valid?
22136	93	"The hegemonic left has instituted a Manichaean division between good and evil: left versus right, liberalism versus fascism, globalism versus sovereignism, vaccination versus no-vax. The “good guys” are obviously the left: liberal but solidary, globalist, inclusive, ecumenical, resilient and sustainable. The ""bad guys"" are also obviously patriots, Christians, right wingers, sovereignists and heterosexuals."
22136	95	Fusion of liberalism and collective socialism
22136	97	What distinguishes the current structure of Western countries from the past?
22136	99	The merging of the worst of liberalism with the worst of collective socialism. Today, after two years of pandemic farce, we see globalist liberalism using communist and dictatorial methods to impose its Great Reset, and communist regimes using liberal methods to enrich the upper echelons of the party, without losing total control over the population. This shows that the geopolitical balance is shifting towards a multipolar vision and that deep state-fueled bipolarism is in decline.
22136	101	Is there a parallel to what is happening in the Catholic Church under the pontificate of Jorge Mario Bergoglio?
22136	103	The deep church is in a sense an offshoot of the deep state. For this reason it should not surprise us that we are witnessing the destruction of faith and morality in the name of ecumenism and synodality, employing liberal errors in the theological realm; and on the other hand, the transformation of the papacy and the Roman Curia into a politburo in which ecclesiastical authority is both absolute and absolved of its fidelity to the magisterium, according to the modalities of exercising power in a dictatorship of communist stamp. The law is no longer based on justice, but on the convenience and utility of those who apply it: it is enough to see how harshly the Vatican treats the clergy and the faithful, who are traditional, and on the other hand, with what forbearance the Vatican praises notorious pro-abortion advocates (I think of Biden and Pelosi as the most notable cases) as well as the propagandists of LGBTQ ideology and gender theory. Here, too, liberalism and communism have joined forces to destroy the institution from within, as has happened in the civilian sphere. But we know that contra legem fit, quod in fraudem legis fit - what bypasses the law is done against the law.
22136	105	Your Excellency, how do you think things may change in the United States in the near future?
22136	107	Donald Trump's eventual return to the White House would allow for real peace negotiations once the deep state has been eliminated from administration and government agencies. But rebuilding will certainly require the cooperation and sacrifice of all, as well as a solid spiritual vision that inspires rebuilding of the social fabric. If all of this happened through the proven voter fraud in the last presidential election, Trump's victory would be even more striking and have a strong impact on the ramifications of the deep state in Europe and particularly in Italy.
22136	109	"In any case, the midterm elections could give Republicans a majority in the House and Senate once the servants of the deep state - most notably the ""neoconservatives"" - are ousted from office."
22136	111	The failure of efforts to blame Trump for the charade of the Capitol attack should deter organizers - who include Nancy Pelosi - from attempting to repeat the scene next year in what isn't just déjà vu would be, but would also slide into the grotesque.
22136	113	Great Reset doomed
22136	115	So has the Great Reset failed? Can we sing a victory song?
22136	117	A victory song can only be sung when the war has been won. The Great Reset is ontologically doomed because it is inspired by inhuman and diabolical principles. But its end, however inevitable, may be some time yet, depending on what we are able to oppose and what is in the plans of divine providence.
22136	119	"If the Lord will grant us a truce, a time of peace, after we have come to understand the terrible hell on earth that the enemies of God and man are seeking, then we must commit ourselves to rebuild - not ""rebuild better."" ' but just the opposite - yes, to rebuild what has been destroyed: the family, the bond of marriage, the moral education of children, love for our country, devotion to hard work and brotherly charity, especially towards one another the most vulnerable and needy. We must affirm the sanctity and sanctity of life from conception to natural death, defend the complementarity of the two sexes against the madness of gender ideology, protect children from corruption, and guarantee the innocence to which they are entitled. We must finally leave behind the logic of profit - which characterizes the liberal mentality - in order to regain the pride of doing our duty, even when no one is looking, to produce what we make professionally and at an honest price for sale. And we must stop considering ourselves inferior just because someone has decided that in their godless model of a dystopian society, being honest, loyal, upright and godly is something to be ashamed of. Rather, those who call for the killing of children and the elderly, for the planned extermination of the population through malicious vaccination campaigns, for mass sterilization, for bestiality, for pedophilia and for the most deviant aberrations should be ashamed."
22136	121	Only where Christ reigns can there be true justice and true peace
22136	123	Your Excellency, do you believe that the world can return to God?
22136	125	The world can and must return to God: this is a necessity arising from the divine order imposed by the Creator on creation. She must return to God, for only where Christ reigns can there be true justice and true peace. And the world can do this, but not in a collectivist or communitarian vision in which the individual disappears into the crowd, but in a personal and individual vision in which each of us freely recognizes that nothing can be better than that what our heavenly Father has prepared for us because he loves us and wants us to share in his glory.
22136	127	As we all return to God, our nations will also acknowledge His rule and conform their laws to His law. So let us pray that what the psalmist sings may come true: Laudate Dominum omnes gentes; laudate eum omnes populi (Psalm 116:1) - praise the Lord, you nations, praise him, you peoples. Quoniam confirmata est super nos misericordia ejus; et veritas Domini manet in æternum (Psalm 116:2) – For his mercy is confirmed upon us, and the truth of the Lord endures forever.
22139	1	Russia continues to reveal: USA used deadly pathogens and ticks for research on Ukrainians
22139	3	"Blood samples from Ukrainian POWs point to their involvement in US biological programs, Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces, said at a briefing on Thursday. This is reported by the magazine ""RT DE""."
22139	5	"RT DE further reports: ""The results are as follows: 33 percent of the soldiers surveyed had hepatitis A, more than four percent had kidney syndrome fever and 20 percent had West Nile fever. Since these diseases are controlled by the Pentagon within the of Ukrainian projects were actively studied, there is reason to believe that members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces participated as volunteers in experiments aimed at assessing the lethality of dangerous infectious diseases,"" Kirillov said."
22139	7	In addition, the chief of the armed forces provided
22139	9	Defense against radiation, chemicals and biological hazards states that
22139	11	the Pentagon since 2005 for bioresearch in Ukraine more than 250
22139	13	spent millions of dollars. According to Kirillov, the US has
22139	15	taken over Ukrainian national collection of microorganisms.
22139	17	A separate project on Ixodid ticks, carriers of a number of highly dangerous infections such as tularemia, West Nile fever and Crimean-Congo fever, was conducted by the University of Texas. Ticks were collected in south-eastern regions of Ukraine.
22139	19	Kirillov also uncovered the research priorities of the Bundeswehr.
22139	21	On May 20, a commission of inquiry of the Russian parliament, which is reviewing and analyzing documents on the work of US biolaboratories in Ukraine, presented new data.
22139	23	Irina Yarovaya, co-chair of the investigative commission, highlighted:
22139	25	We see Ukraine as one of the bases of the major military-biological bacteriological weapons production program being conducted by the United States of America
22139	27	According to documents seized during the military operation in Ukraine, the US has also introduced a system of full control over the epidemiological situation in Ukraine.
22139	29	Irina Yarovaya made it clear:
22139	31	In Ukraine, with the support of the US Department of Defense, an online rating system, i.e. a system of constant control of data collection and processing, was introduced. All data was submitted to the US Department of Defense's National Center for Medical Intelligence.
22140	1	Wimbledon winner: Elena Rybakina, who plays for Kazakhstan, was massively attacked because of her Russian origin
22140	3	Dealing with Russian athletes or artists shows once again how far the Western “community of values” has moved away from the principles of the rule of law that were taken for granted just a few years ago. Until now it has been said that all people are equal before the law and that nobody should be discriminated against because of their origin or religion, but all this is now a thing of the past.
22140	5	"Mob with ""attitude"" railed against the Wimbledon winner"
22140	7	"Today, as often in the past, there is a ""perpetrator nation"" and it is therefore obviously a virtue to officially discriminate against people of Russian origin. These high apostles of morals have obviously learned nothing from history and in this sense the Russian-born winner of the tennis tournament in Wimbledon was badmouthed:"
22140	9	"""She lives in Moscow, her parents live in Moscow... she's Russian!"" chanted the mob, the Daily Mail reported. Angry tennis fans mock the Wimbledon ban for Russian players after Moscow-born Elena Rybakina won her first Grand Slam title on Center Court."
22140	11	The tennis player was only allowed to compete after she decided to represent Kazakhstan from 2018. The 23-year-old beat Tunisia's world No. 2 Ons Jabeur 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 in the sweltering heat on Center Court. However, with players from Russia and Belarus banned by the All England Club earlier this year due to the war in Ukraine, Rybakina's success has sparked widespread outrage from fans on social media.
22140	13	"""Not chosen where I was born"""
22140	15	After the Wimbledon triumph, the native Russian emphasized her ties to Kazakhstan when asked about Russia.
22140	17	"“From my side I can only say that I represent Kazakhstan. I didn't choose where I was born."""
22140	19	When asked whether she condemned the war in Ukraine and the actions of Vladimir Putin, she said:
22140	21	"""People believed in me. Kazakhstan supported me so much. Also today there was so much support, I saw the flags. I don't know how to answer these questions"" She hopes that the war ""will be over as soon as possible""."
22140	23	The men's No. 1 remains blocked
22140	25	"Men's No. 1 Daniil Medvedev has been suspended due to All England Club rules. The winner of the men's tournament, Novak Djokovic, considers the Wimbledon ban of Russian players ""crazy"" and calls for non-interference in sport, as our editorial team previously reported."

22141	1	When sanctions backfire: The EU has no plan
22141	3	While Germany reports its first trade deficit in 30 years, the outlook for Western European industry as a whole also looks bleak. The EU has no plan for life without cheap energy from Russia. So what happens next?
22141	5	Germany's foreign trade balance for the month of May showed a deficit of one billion euros. This has led many analysts to question the future of the country's economy and the prospects for the European Union in general.
22141	7	The bad news doesn't end there, however. On July 3rd, the total global market capitalization of Germany, i.e. the value of German companies on the global stock exchanges, was at an all-time low of 1.97 percent. Meanwhile, on July 5, the euro fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2002.
22141	9	Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute for International Finance, summarized the situation of German foreign trade quite well. He wrote on Twitter:
22141	11	Germany's growth model was to import cheap energy from Russia, use it to manufacture manufactured goods, and export those goods around the world. Now that Germany is looking for new energy suppliers, its trade balance and that of the euro zone will look ugly.
22141	13	The question is whether this decline will be permanent or not. Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Beijing University, also shared his thoughts on Twitter, but said Germany's trade deficit is not truly historic. The finance professor wrote:
22141	15	Germany will only switch from permanent surpluses to permanent deficits if there has been either a permanent increase in German investment or a permanent decline in German savings.
22141	17	"Pettis went on to say that neither of those things happened, with the former being ""unlikely"" and the latter ""unrelated to the recent German trade balance adjustment."" Because of this, he considers the situation to be temporary."
22141	19	However, it seems reasonable to assume that there is a clear connection between rising energy prices and this blow to German industry. Rising energy prices also imply inflation-related savings. On July 7, Germany's neighbor the Czech Republic reported a foreign trade deficit of almost $1 billion - reinforcing the correlation between rising European energy prices and falling exports.
22141	21	So the main problem is exactly where Robin Brooks put it, namely the EU's energy source. If cheap Russian energy is indeed permanently banned from the EU, then logically the impact on EU economies will be permanent - unless, in a highly unlikely scenario, an alternative supply can be provided that is both sufficient and at comparable prices acquire is.
22141	23	One solution on the table is for the EU to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States. Deliveries of American LNG to the EU and the UK have been increasing since political tensions between the EU and Russia began. According to the US Bureau of Energy Information, the US exported 74 percent of its LNG to Europe in the first four months of this year, up from 34 percent last year. But that is apparently not enough to keep European energy prices stable.
22141	25	This raises a fundamental question, namely whether the European Union can actually afford to maintain its sanctions against Russia. Member States' economic models are simply incompatible with reality - the reality created by the sanctions, in which the well-being of citizens has been damaged and social and political tensions loom.
22141	27	"The foreign policy of the European Union follows the doctrine of ""strategic autonomy"". But what is happening now is neither strategic nor an act of autonomy. Undoubtedly, the situation in Ukraine is appalling and has prompted Europeans to question the region's existing security architecture. But if NATO's latest strategic concept can be taken as a hint, then Washington comes into play."
22141	29	"Respected international relations scholar John Mearsheimer lamented in a recent speech that ""history will condemn the United States and its allies with ample severity for their foolish Ukraine policy."" Indeed, the current dominant Allied policy in the Ukraine conflict is doing everything it can to ensure that the conflict is protracted - with the double risk of destroying Ukraine and harming Europe's future economic prospects."
22141	31	Because the longer the conflict lasts, or if it continues indefinitely, it means that the division between Russia and the West will remain permanent. And it logically follows that this scenario will have an impact on the economic model of the European countries, and in particular that of Germany. If this is the outcome we are heading towards, the future of the EU becomes a question to be asked.
22141	33	The Czech capital Prague is already joking that in a few years Europe will be nothing more than a summer vacation spot for Americans and Chinese. But are there really enough tourism jobs here for everyone? And can everyone survive the winter off-season?
22141	35	Joking aside. I personally believe that Germany's trade deficit is significant. In a few days, the trend could become even clearer if other European industrialized countries report similar deficits. This should at least ring alarm bells as to what exactly the European Union's long-term plans are towards Russia and whether or not European industry can survive with sanctions on Russian energy.
22145	3	In an opinion piece on RT Deutsch, Fyodor Lukyanov, Editor-in-Chief of Russia in Global Affairs, Chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy and Research Director of the Valday International Discussion Club, writes:
22145	5	"“The collective Western community is now at its maximum capacity, with its European flank made up of members of the EU and NATO plus Ukraine and Moldova, with its Asian club made up of South Korea, Japan and Singapore, which has stopped bickering and the chose the ""right"" side, with the oceanic pairing and of course with North America. The “free world” has never been so extensive. However, this raises a serious question: has the West reached its maximum limits beyond which expansion is no longer possible? And if so, what does that mean?"
22145	7	In fact, the theory of the limits of Western influence springs from the infamous “end of history” notion, which has become so overused it has even become uncomfortable to pronounce.”
22148	1	EU chief diplomat complains about lack of support for anti-Russian course from the Global South
22148	3	"The West likes to paint the picture of a globally unified standpoint of the ""international community"" against Russia. But now one of the West's most senior officials is questioning that image himself."
22148	5	"The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said after the meeting of foreign ministers of the G20 countries in Bali that the West was losing ""the global battle of narratives"" in relation to Ukraine and will continue to do so work to change this situation. The EU chief diplomat wrote on his blog on Sunday:"
22148	7	The global battle of narratives is in full swing, and right now we're not winning. As the EU, we must continue to engage to refute the Russian lies and war propaganda and to make it clear who is responsible for the aggression and its consequences.
22148	9	"Borrell praised the ""consolidated stance"" of the G20 countries, all of which - with the exception of Russia - had supported the UN General Assembly's resolution condemning the Russian military operation in Ukraine. However, Borrell pointed out that this unity breaks down when it comes to discussing how to proceed and the consequences of the crisis."
22148	11	"While the G7 and its allies agree on the pressure on Russia through sanctions and the attempt to hold ""the regime"" in Moscow accountable, others, namely the majority of the countries of the ""Global South"", seem to have a different view to have perspective."
22148	13	"Borrell also explained that most countries are reluctant to ""name the aggressor"" for a variety of reasons: some fear the consequences for themselves, others complain about ""double standards"", strive to maintain good relations with Russia, or tried not to jeopardize their putative geopolitical interests."
22148	15	"The statement also named Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who walked out of the G20 after his speech, which Borrell took as proof of ""how much Russia really cares about multilateral forums."""
22148	17	Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24 after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics asked for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian forces. In response to the Russian operation, Western countries launched a full-scale sanctions campaign against Moscow and began supplying Ukraine with more weapons, including heavy weapons.
22149	1	A new democratic-sovereignist movement is forming in Italy
22149	3	"Hidden by the media and mainstream, a new and ambitious party has been founded in Italy. ""Ancora Italia"" wants a democratic turnaround and a sovereign Italy without the EU and without NATO."
22149	5	Italy is known for the fact that new political actors can penetrate the republic's levers. The Five Star Movement is the current example. But the big break with the system did not bring the five stars together either, instead they are now supporting Mario Draghi, a former Goldman Sachs banker and ECB boss.
22149	7	A Youtuber versus Draghi
22149	9	"While Draghi and with him the entire political elite are clinging to power, while Italy is gripped by a massive social crisis, new political actors are organizing themselves. For example, the party ""Ancora Italia"", which emerged last year ""from below"", as ""L'Indipendente"" writes. The second national congress of the new party took place in Naples last weekend. Thousands of visitors crowded into Naples's Palapartenope Theater to a deafening media silence."
22149	11	"""Ancora Italia"" wants to stand in the next elections, the principles of the movement are clear: full national sovereignty for Italy, thus leaving the EU and NATO and the realization of an economy that does not ""humiliate the principle of self-determination of peoples"". The specific party program was also fine-tuned at the congress."
22149	13	The speakers at the congress came from the right and the left. For example, MEP Francesca Donato, who was able to move into the EU Parliament in 2019 via Matteo Salvini's list, spoke. But Marco Rizzo, Secretary General of the Italian Communist Party, was also among the speakers. Francesco Toscano and Mario Gallo, President and National Secretary of Ancora Italia respectively, opened the discussion on the political program and guidelines for the next elections.
22149	15	Criticism of the media and the Russia controversy
22149	17	"Toscana is a journalist and successful YouTuber who has 209,000 subscribers on his channel ""Visione TV"". He called the guests at the congress like Donato and Rizzo “the best free and courageous intelligentsia in the country”. These would put themselves ""at the service of a unified project"". At the beginning of June, former five-star senator Bianca Laura Granato also joined Ancora Italia."
22149	19	"Toscana addressed sharp words to the media. He called out to journalists during the congress: ""Let the servants of the system, the clowns in the service of an apparatus tending to suppress dissent, know that we will not back down an inch""."
22149	21	A few hours later, the pro-government newspaper Open reported that Francesco Toscano “over time has won the support of various personalities pursued by the world of disinformation and the Italian conspiracy.” “Ancora Italia” was on the second National Congress also “formalized” their support for Vladimir Putin's Russia.
22149	23	For a sovereign and democratic Italy
22149	25	"Toscana's words on the Ukraine conflict were greeted with an ovation by the 3,000 guests. What was he really saying? ""I recognize the reasons of Russia, which intervened in Donbass to end a genocide, as inviolable. We are on the side of those fighting against the Nazis, transformed from men with no sense of mockery into Kantian philosophers. Noi siamo dalla parte di chi combatte i nazisti trasfigurati in filosofi kantiani da gente senza senso del ridicolo."")"
22149	27	"Toscana told L'Indipendente: “We from Ancora Italia want to return to a solid, participatory politics, with territorial sections that live, where people can discuss and educate themselves, and which are therefore serious intermediaries, indispensable for democracy ."""
22149	29	"“Ancora” sees itself as a democratic-sovereignist movement. Toscana: ""The current system aims to prevent individuals from exercising a kind of democratic counter-power to the technical violence of the financial system through self-organization, which leads to alienation from public life."""
22149	31	"It is seen as a task to organize ""the growing dissent"" in Italy and ""to create a perspective for radical change, pursued with democratic and participatory methods and with respect for the Constitution, repeatedly betrayed by Draghi and his ministers"". , can be read in the congress report of “Ancora”."
2215	1	Build, build, build: mass immigration is taking its toll
2215	3	"The ""immigration without action"" and the additional import of countless people to Germany never end. In 2020 there were 1,186,702 people moving to Germany; minus the emigration, the net migration from abroad was 220,251 people. There will be even more in 2021, for which the exact data is not yet available. The Federal Statistical Office estimates that there was between 270,000 and 320,000 people in the balance sheet for the previous year. The number of inhabitants has risen by 2.5 million to around 83.2 million since Chancellor Merkel’s half-time, whereby the exact number is likely to be between 1 and 4 percent higher according to the municipal registers – which means that 85 million people are likely to live in Germany ."
2215	5	"Undeterred by this development, the traffic light coalition wants to make Germany even more of an ""immigration country"". Already in the preamble of their coalition agreement, the three parties emphasize their common ""understanding of Germany as a diverse immigration society"". This is reflected there, in Chapter VII, under the programmatic title ""Germany's responsibility for Europe and the world, Europe, integration, migration, flight"" on a total of 13 pages. The government knows that the media and business leaders of many sectors are on their side in this endeavor, or, conversely, it is the vicarious agent of both."
2215	7	"More people need more housing; that's why 400,000 apartments are to be built every year, 300,000 are no longer enough. In order to be able to stomp this out of the ground, the construction and finishing trades require additional workers from abroad - because among the previous successful globetrotters with final destination Germany there are not enough suitable and willing - not only for the construction industry, but also for the other economic sectors . And the “new arrivals” also want to live somewhere. Or will they soon be ""assigned"" by law to those with housing, as was the case after the war? When forced quarantine and compulsory vaccinations become normal, then it will certainly not be far to forced billeting."
2215	9	Various reasons for vacancy
2215	11	"But maybe that's not so dramatic, because: ""We have two billion vacant apartments in Germany,"" said Bonn's green mayor Katja Dörner verbatim. She probably meant two million, which is three zeros less. After all, that's fewer zeros than there are in their offices and committees in the country - so forget it. But the figure of two million is of course not correct either: In reality there are 722,000 residential units vacant, or around 2.8 percent (but you can no longer take our political amateurs at their word anyway). There are many reasons for this vacancy. If a change takes place after four years of letting and the apartment is prepared for new tenants for a month, this temporary vacancy alone accounts for two percent statistically. “We live too big” we are told – meanwhile on an average of 46 square meters per person. That's not entirely true either, because the temporarily vacant apartments are also included in this calculation, as are other special circumstances; for example, the soldiers stationed here and their families have a special status that falsifies the statistics."
2215	13	"But now to the real problem: the conflicting goals of even more land use, construction activity and CO2 emissions. It's the same phenomenon almost everywhere: the same people who are demanding and supporting more immigration resist the development of new building areas for ""reasons of sustainability"" - and, as far as it affects their immediate area, of course also against wind turbines that produce construction site electricity and if there is a loss of Coal, oil and gas could provide energy for living. A study found that 35 percent of CO2 emissions for living are due to construction alone. The erection of buildings - not the subsequent living and heating. Because the more apartments are built, the more energy-intensive concrete is required, the production of which is a CO2 slingshot."
2216	3	Records show that over a million people in the United States have died from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Every single one of these deaths can be attributed to the White House Chief Medical Advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci.
2216	5	The US is estimated to have passed the one million mark for COVID-19 deaths as of Wednesday night, March 23. This comes according to data from statistics website Worldometers, which at the time of press claims the US has 1,002 million COVID-19 deaths.
2216	7	"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has yet to confirm this, as they only update their ""official"" COVID-19 data every two weeks. The agency's data tracker website still shows US deaths at around 972,000."
2216	9	If current trends continue, the US death toll from COVID-19 will top 1.2 million by the end of April.
2216	11	This catastrophic loss of life should not be discounted. In two years, more Americans have died from COVID-19 than from any war the United States has fought combined since the 20th century, including World War II. On average, nearly 3,000 Americans die from the coronavirus every two days, more than the 2,977 people killed on 9/11.
2216	13	One in 100 people over the age of 65 has died from COVID-19. Over 200,000 children have lost a parent or primary caregiver. The broader societal impact of this pandemic has yet to be properly grasped.
2216	14	"Fauci is responsible for at least 400,000 ""official"" COVID-19 deaths"
2216	16	According to The New American journalist Ben Armstrong, Fauci should be blamed for nearly half of the deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the United States. he's too nice
2216	18	Armstrong based his conclusions on research by Edward Dowd, a hedge fund expert and former equity portfolio manager at investment firm BlackRock.
2216	20	"""It's either stupidity or a plan,"" Dowd said during an interview. “But in the first year of the pandemic we prevented early treatment and put people on intubators and a lot of people died. There were estimates that if there was early prevention and if you didn't intubate people, 400,000 people didn't have to die in the first year."""
2216	22	Fauci, as senior White House medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is a major influence on the COVID-19 protocol and can be blamed for pushing hospital policies that are leading to more deaths from the coronavirus to have. Some of those policies include putting severe COVID-19 patients on ventilators and giving them the toxic drug remdesivir.
2216	24	Armstrong pointed out that remdesivir is one of only a handful of drugs approved by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and many doctors across the country have protested its use.
2216	26	Without remdesivir, Armstrong said, COVID-19 patients in hospitals only have to worry about their lungs and breathing. But with remdesivir, their kidneys have become a problem as the drug could cause kidney problems, multiple studies show.
2216	28	"Once the kidneys and other organs of COVID-19 patients begin to close, hospitals put them on ventilators. ""Who did all this? Fauci did all of that,"" Armstrong said. ""That's why I'm following these deaths on Fauci. That's Fauci's fault."""
2216	30	"Armstrong added that he could blame even more COVID-19 deaths in the US because of his role in funding the coronavirus research functions in Wuhan, China. ""Even though he denies it, we all know it's true,"" he said. And that's exactly why every single COVID-19 death -- not just in the US, but around the world -- can be attributed to Fauci."
2216	32	He added that hundreds of thousands more American deaths should also be attributed to Fauci for supporting and promoting the use of the experimental and dangerous COVID-19 vaccines.
2216	34	"""People chose to obey Fauci, doctors chose to obey Fauci. They didn't have to, and Fauci is why they should never have obeyed,"" Armstrong said. ""Do not obey like a slave, because you will have disastrous consequences""."
22161	3	"Peschiera des Garda, Italy (World Express). Anyone who thinks they cannot cope with the Germanization of one or the other word in the Latin language should write Schwarzer instead of Neger. One or the other black was at the ""Africa parties"" of the Nafris and thus the North Africans, especially Arabs, at Lake Garda. Hundreds of young, male foreigners, including Mohammedans and cutlers, hung around Lake Garda. Sexual harassment and all sorts of insults not only by women were apparently not in short supply, but the rule. This also applied to theft."
22161	5	"The young men from Africa thought they were ""celebrating"" ""L'Africa a Peschiera"" (""Africa in Peschiera"") under a motto of the conversion of many people. Their celebration also included brawls, attempted rapes, and plenty of property damage."
22161	7	"Under the headline “Peschiera del Garda – fight and sexual harassment after a trap music meeting on Lake Garda”, the “Kleine Zeitung” (June 13, 2022) reports that “a gathering of hundreds of young people who attended a festival with trap music ( a sub-genre of hip-hop) on a beach in Peschiera del Garda on the south-eastern shore of Lake Garda in northern Italy"" and that ""a few days ago this degenerated into a huge brawl and then into riots"". It was ""the beach of Campanello-Pioppi between Castelnuovo and Peschiera del Garda""."
22161	9	"The fact that the police had to intervene and clear the area with the use of batons is no secret. In ""Der Standard"" (June 13, 2022) there is as little information about the repopulation as in ""Kleine Zeitung"", but Dominik Straub reports from Rome under the title ""Peschiera del Garda - riots and sexual harassment by young North Africans in Italy"". that ""about 2,500 people - mainly young men with a North African migration background"" were responsible for the riots by foreigners on Lake Garda and that they are called ""Afro-Baby-Gang"" in the Italian media, but also that it was in a video that has been showing since Friday circulating on the world network means: ""Peschiera was just a foretaste, see you in Riccione."" ."
22161	11	There was no renewed gathering of foreigners, because in Riccione a large number of police officers were called up early on, who were sorely missed in Peschiera del Garda at the beginning.
22161	13	Experts and critics believe that in most of the main outflow media of the apartheid state of Germany, which has been a vassal state of the United States with the United Kingdom in the dinghy since it came into existence, there have been gaps in lying. Bernhard Zimniok (AfD) shared in the “Facebook” (June 14, 2022): “A few days ago, 2,000 Africans rioted at Lake Garda, there were fights, stabbings and sexual assaults. The ARD and ZDF, which are committed to neutrality and objectivity, refused their indoctrinated viewers any reporting about it. Instead, they reported on the legalization of cannabis in Thailand – or a pizza-making championship in Argentina. The consumer of the compulsory fee-financed propaganda should simply not be confronted with reality. Therefore: Abolish broadcasting fees!”
22161	15	In Italy, many people in politics and the press are already a step further. Matteo Salvini (Lega), a former Deputy Prime Minister, shared: “Violence and threats are not welcome, if these 'good guys' don't like it here they might as well leave Italy, along with the complicit or distracted 'parents'. Members of the Lega achieved 34 percent of the votes in the last elections to the supposed European Parliament and became the strongest political party in Italy.
22161	17	In the local elections last Sunday, her and other candidates who not only want to end the revolution, but also reverse it, did well, prophecies of doom from their opponents in politics and the press.
22164	1	Aggressive land grabs and lots of “single cases”: clash of cultures
22164	3	"The images of the last few weeks will be burned into the collective memory of Europeans. First, 2,000 migrants terrorized bathers on Lake Garda and shouted: ""This is Africa!"" June, which the system declared as ""Pride Month"", resulted in migrant violence. The mainstream covers up the causes. As a new, imported sense of honor makes way, unknown to Europeans for good reason, many are wondering: Is this still the home I know?"
22164	5	"Sometimes it's a mass brawl between immigrants in the Berlin outdoor pool, days later a fight between rival Arab clans in Duisburg. It is the ""dislocations"" that the US political scientist and globalist Yasha Mounk spoke of when he praised the risk of multiculturalism as a historically unique ""experiment"". It is precisely the ""liberal"" lifestyle that is the first to be targeted by the aggressive land grab."
22164	7	If the globalists and their political-media henchmen have their way, mass migration can only be portrayed positively. This is what the UN Migration Pact and the world restructuring “Agenda 2030” say.
22169	1	"Putin: ""Unfortunately, Nord Stream has to be throttled because my dog ​​ate the turbine"""
22169	3	Moscow (dpo) - What bad luck! According to Vladimir Putin, gas supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline have to be drastically reduced after his dog Buffy ate a turbine necessary for the operation.
22169	5	"Yes, that was totally unfortunate, the Russian President apologized on state television. ""Actually, after the maintenance break, the gas should flow again completely according to the contracts. But unfortunately my Buffy thought that the turbine, which is so important for the operation, was something to eat. Such bad luck!"""
22169	7	"Putin only let the Karakatschan males out of sight for a very short moment. ""When I got back, one of the turbines was gone. There were still a few pieces around Buffy though."""
22169	9	This is what the turbine that was eaten by Putin's dog looked like:
22169	11	It is currently unclear when more gas will be able to flow again. According to Putin's veterinarian, however, there is a chance that the dog will spit out the turbine voluntarily. All the EU has to do is give up all support for Ukraine and recognize the territories occupied by Russia.
22170	3	Cairo (dpo) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made a clear statement on Russia's intentions in Ukraine yesterday during his trip abroad. He also mentioned a possible overthrow of the Ukrainian government by the Kremlin.
22170	5	"We want to change the Ukrainian government… Excuse me? Lavrov said while an aide whispered something to him. ""That happens automatically every five years through an election? Why do you do something like that?"" Then, in disbelief, the diplomat allowed himself to be explained about the modalities of the democratic system in Ukraine."
22170	7	Lavrov learned, for example, that the government of incumbent President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to power through such an election in 2019 and replaced the previous government of Petro Poroshenko. Such a regular systemic regime change is also planned for 2024.
22170	9	"""I could have sworn elections only serve to confirm the incumbent ruler, who automatically always wins,"" Lavrov said. ""Or to occasionally exchange the president and prime minister for constitutional reasons. At least that's how we know it from Russia, where my boss Vladimir Putin has been in power since 1999 and I've been foreign minister since 2004. Is that how everyone in the West does it? It's totally stupid because then the people everywhere can join in. How are you supposed to cement your power forever like that."""
22170	11	"According to Lavrov, however, Russia still wants to stick to the regime change plans for Ukraine. ""That's also necessary, because unfortunately we have to assume that the Ukrainians, with their funny system, will not vote for Putin voluntarily."

22173	3	Laughing with Putin: Titanic satirizes war and German neo-heroism
22174	3	Brussels/Dresden – After Economics Minister Robert Habeck (52, Greens) or FDP man Wolfgang Kubicki (70), PARTEI boss Martin Sonneborn (57) now also gave his recommendation for the election of the mayor in Dresden. In addition to the state capital itself, one candidate did not fare well.
22174	5	"Unlike Robert Habeck, I've never lived in your shitty town. This is how the less than charming video by MEP, PARTEI founder and Titanic veteran Martin Sonneborn begins. ""I don't like them at all, I also campaigned for the Frauenkirche to be demolished at the time,"" he continues to etch against our beautiful Florence on the Elbe."
22174	7	"Brief explanation: In his video call for elections, Habeck said that Dresden had even been something of a ""second home"" for him in the meantime and that he even had his own jogging track here."
22174	9	After the first flood of insults, which are probably not meant to be taken seriously, Sonneborn then allows himself to be carried away to a first election recommendation, which is again presented only unflatteringly.
22174	11	"Please do not under any circumstances vote for the green candidate whose name I just forgot. Because: ""Whenever you vote for the Greens, we get involved in wars."" And ""you know your way around wars (in Dresden) - kennel smiley""."
22174	13	A clear allusion by the controversial satirist to what is probably Dresden's darkest day, February 13, 1945.
22174	15	"But with whom would Martin Sonneborn make his cross himself? ""Choose Jan Pöhnisch (32)"" - the candidate of the PARTEI Dresden, is his recommendation, which was also promptly shared on Twitter in Dresden."
22174	17	At the end of the video, with which he probably did not make many friends in Dresden, Sonneborn waved goodbye to the wide world of the World Wide Web.
22175	3	"Hanover (dpo) - Is the gas shortage that is being talked about everywhere scaremongering? Are we all being lied to by the government? Yes, claims Ingo Bölke from Hanover. The amateur physicist and gas denier believes that the existence of ""gas"" cannot be scientifically proven."
22175	5	"A valuable 'air' that you can light to heat? Bölke asks mockingly. ""Of course! The government doesn't believe that itself. It's all a big lie, so that everyone is afraid in winter and the heat pump industry can fill its pockets."""
22175	7	"So far, nobody has been able to show him the supposed ""gas"" that everyone supposedly needs so urgently. ""But it's also practical that this gas is invisible like Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. You just have to trust Habeck and Scholz and save a lot, because otherwise we'll all die."""
22175	9	From Bölke's point of view, heating simply heats up when you turn it on and the gas stove produces a flame when you switch it on. This is similar to a lamp or a faucet.
22175	11	"He points to a gas balloon hanging under the ceiling. ""Look,"" he says, popping the balloon with a needle. ""There was nothing in it. Nothing at all. Anyone can carry out this experiment at home and understand it for themselves."""
22176	3	Frankfurt (dpo) - That's just annoying! Since the start of the Lufthansa strike, Friedrich Merz, who is currently planning to fly home from Frankfurt to Sauerland in his private plane, has been constantly harassed by hitchhikers.
22176	5	"Everywhere they stand around with their thumbs out and block the runway, the CDU boss said irritably. ""How are you supposed to take off like that? Away over there! Otherwise my propellers will make salami!"""
22176	7	"Merz makes a defensive gesture and calls out the window. ""NO! I'm not flying to Malle by accident. I'm on my way home to Arnsberg! I don't care if you only have 12 kilograms of luggage with you. No! Not even if you take part in the fuel."""
22176	9	"Suddenly Merz stops his machine. ""Hmmm... Exactly how much would you pay? Okay. Put a zero after that and we're in business. What do you mean usury here? It's market economy. No, there's no discount! Take it or leave, okay? Is the deal on? Excellent, come in! But wait, stop! Pay first, then fly."""

Because, according to Charlie Chester: Fear sells. After the scaremongering with Corona, now comes climate change. And this is apparently not much more than a media propaganda fairy tale. This is reported by the magazine ""Wochenblick.at""."
22177	5	"The magazine goes on to say: ""Crowd-control scaremongering"
22177	7	"In video from US investigative platform Project Veritas, Chester can be heard saying that ""the story of Covid-19"" is coming to an end and CNN is willing to sell the story of ""climate change"" and ""fear"" too stir up Because according to Chester, the public is no longer afraid of Corona. Therefore, the elites could no longer use it to control the masses. In his view, the media needs a ""story"" with ""longevity."""
22177	9	Propaganda: after Corona comes climate change
22177	11	"When asked how he would define propaganda, he explained: ""For example, you can influence the perception of an entire people about something, depending on how you do it."" The corona pandemic will go back so far that it is no longer a problem, said Chester. Climate change, on the other hand, will take years. The CNN director explains: “Our focus was to oust Trump, right? Without saying it, that's it, right? So our next thing will be climate change awareness. Climate change will be the next Covid thing for CNN. We're going to jump at it."" The decision to focus on climate change came from former CNN boss Jeff Zucker, who left the network in early 2022."
22177	13	The video is a continuation of a series of clips originally released in 2021 and is currently going viral again on social media. The CNN director chatted so lightheartedly out of the box that he thought he was on a Tinder date. His remarks make it clear how the mainstream media work and what for: They spread fear in order to control and direct the population in the sense of the globalist power elites! Reality doesn't matter.
22178	1	More COVID-19 deaths in children since vaccination began — and no one is investigating why
22178	3	The sense of vaccinating children against the corona virus is controversial among physicians. The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) rates the benefit of the measure for minors aged five and over as higher than the possible risks. However, according to the RKI, significantly more minors and young adults under the age of 20 have died “of or with” COVID-19 than before since child vaccination began. Since mid-August 2021, the number of people of this age who have died has quadrupled from 23 to 94. However, there is apparently little political interest in researching the reason.
22178	5	"Government: ""Check the weekly report"""
22178	7	The member of the Bundestag Kay-Uwe Ziegler (AfD) tried to bring light into the darkness. He wanted to know from the federal government how many of the young people who had died from or with the corona virus had been vaccinated once, twice or three times.
22178	9	However, the federal government did not provide concrete figures. Instead, in her answer of July 13, which is available to the author, she referred the questioner to the latest RKI weekly report. He should look there. Problem: The requested information is not included in this paper. The letter of reply was signed by the SPD member of parliament and parliamentary state secretary in the Ministry of Health, Sabine Dittmar.
22178	11	In addition, Ziegler wanted to know how many of the deceased children and young people were autopsied after their death. Because the highest German science authority always assured in its reports, in which it listed the number of deceased minors, that all of these cases were “individually checked and validated by the RKI”. Apparently that didn't happen. The government explained to the questioner that they didn't know anything about this because it was the responsibility of the local health authorities.
22178	13	In mid-August 2021, STIKO recommended two doses of vaccine for all 12 to 17 year olds. In December, she initially recommended the same for previously ill younger children aged five and over and those who lived in a household with “vulnerable” people. In March of this year, she suggested a third vaccination to young people aged twelve and over, and in May all younger children aged five and over at least a single dose.
22178	15	It is now common knowledge that the vaccines do not protect against infection and transmission of the virus, i.e. do not offer complete protection from others. According to official rhetoric, however, they protect against severe courses and death from COVID-19. In view of the data from the intensive care register of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), this is also extremely questionable. In the case of children and adolescents, the question of the benefit arises in particular because of the low level of concern.
22178	17	Significantly more young corona deaths since vaccination began
22178	19	"The development of the ""corona deaths"" recorded by the RKI among those under 20 is therefore a cause for concern. From the beginning of the pandemic until the beginning of January 2021, the Institute registered a total of 14 deaths in these age groups, as shown on page 8 of this situation report. In its weekly report of August 19, 2021, it reported on page 15 that 23 children and young people had died in the meantime, nine more than at the beginning of the year."
22178	21	Broken down, this means that in the first year of Corona, according to RKI data, a minor died every 21 days in connection with the corona virus. From January to mid-August 2021, there was one such death about every 23 days. However, this has changed for the worse since the first vaccination recommendation for young people aged twelve and over in mid-August.
22178	23	"From August 19, 2021 to the end of December last year, i.e. within four and a half months, the RKI recorded 15 more corona deaths in this age group. In its weekly report of December 30, 2021, it had already reported on page 9 of 38 deaths among under-20s. According to this, during these four and a half months, a minor died statically every nine days ""on or with"" the virus. According to the RKI counting method, the corona mortality of the youngest increased by about two and a half times compared to the time before."
22178	25	Corona deaths among minors are currently seven times more common
22178	27	The authority has recorded an even more drastic increase since the beginning of this year. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the RKI had already reported 94 deaths among under-20s by July 6. That is 56 more deaths than at the end of December and 71 more than in mid-August last year.
22178	29	Statistically, the RKI even recorded a new death among the youngest about every third day in connection with a corona infection. Compared to the period from March 2020 to August 2021, when children and adolescents were not yet vaccinated on a large scale, this means a more than seven-fold increase in corona mortality in the youngest age groups.
22178	31	Higher case numbers are not sufficient as the sole explanation
22178	33	This correlates with the rapid increase in the number of cases determined since adult vaccinations began at the end of 2020. In 2021, the RKI identified a total of 5.3 million new positive cases - almost three times more than in 2020 (1.9 million). In the first half of 2022 alone, 22 million new cases were added, eleven times more than in the entire first year of Corona. However, it is still unclear what role the vaccinations themselves play in this. As early as 2020, some scientists had warned of so-called immune escape variants caused by vaccines that do not induce sterile immunity.
22178	35	On the other hand, a comparison of the total number of deaths with the number of cases indicates a significant decrease in the danger of the virus, especially since the omicron variants became established at the beginning of this year. For children and young people, the risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying has been close to zero since the beginning of the pandemic.
22178	37	In addition, the increase in case numbers before childhood vaccinations began did not appear to affect deaths in the youngest age groups. On the contrary: From January to August 2021, the RKI even reported a minor who died “on or with” Corona less frequently than in the previous year. That all changed with the advent of vaccinations.
22179	3	Almost all airlines have required their employees to be vaccinated. You now get the bill presented with high sickness rates and the resulting enormous chaos. This time Lufthansa itself is affected and not just the subsidiaries.
22179	5	TKP recently reported on 52 of 360 canceled flights at Lufthansa subsidiary AUA and strikes at Lufthansa subsidiary Brussels Airlines. Lufthansa itself has already canceled 5,770 flights planned for the summer, and there is a lack of healthy staff on the ground and on the planes. The syringe keeps the planes on the ground. At the Lufthansa subsidiary Swiss, there have long been disputes with flying personnel who refuse to be vaccinated.
22179	7	"""Bild am Sonntag"" (BamS) ran the headline yesterday ""At Lufthansa, almost every third person is sick"". A Lufthansa spokesman on BamS:"
22179	9	“The sickness rates among our ground staff have risen sharply. Due to CoV infections, but also due to overwork, the sickness rate here reaches up to 30 percent. For flight personnel in the cockpit and cabin, the rate is significantly lower in the single digits.”
22179	11	A short video in the article shows queues of passengers at Hamburg Airport stretching back to the street. At Frankfurt Airport, 5,000 Lufthansa passengers' suitcases are left behind on the ground every day.
22179	13	The reason for this is the generally much higher probability of infection and disease in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. Especially compared to the various Omicron variants, vaccinated people are considerably more susceptible.
22179	15	We have seen that in Germany the difference in the vaccination rate between east and west is also reflected in the incidence rates - the higher the vaccination rate, the higher the incidence rates. And Lufthansa now has one of the highest vaccination rates.
22179	17	In the weekly reports of the RKI from July 7th and 14th, this is explained under point 1.4. Geographical distribution confirmed as follows:
22179	19	"""The observed geographical differences in reporting incidences can possibly be explained not only by different testing and vaccination behavior but also by the regionally different course of previous waves of infection."""
22179	21	Well, at least the RKI is willing to admit for the first time that immunity acquired through infection protects against infection and disease. Conversely, of course, it also means that vaccination does not protect and is even harmful. You can see the differences between the GDR and the FRG and with Lufthansa.
22180	1	"14-year-old student from Berlin: »Compulsory service? No thank you!"""
22180	3	"In earlier times there was a one-stroke rhetorical checkmate against young people with a bad inclination towards socialism: ""Go over there!"" Everyone knew they wouldn't do that. And everyone knew exactly why."
22180	5	When Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier proposed compulsory military service for young people, he may have had a similar move in mind. We do not know it.
22180	7	"In any case, it didn't take long before a student from Berlin got in touch with a small article in Die Welt. The 14-year-old's answer was unequivocal: »Compulsory service? No thank you!"""
22180	9	"Not equal. At first, the high school student claimed about her peers: A job in the social field ""should definitely be attractive for many."" Then she rowed back hard. With remarkable arguments:"
22180	11	"""Even if politicians like Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier are convinced that it would be good for our country, one cannot simply assign inexperienced young people responsible tasks"". - I don't think anyone will argue with that."
22180	13	"However, the Federal President's proposal was not aimed at qualified work, but at unskilled work, as is likely to be the case in every hospital and nursing home. However, Alma von Raggamby rejects such ""base activities"" for herself. In other words, they should be made by others for them. You can guess why migrants from Arabia and Africa should come to Berlin."
22180	15	"The justification is foolhardy: ""Many adolescents don't know which career path they want to take after school,"" reports Alma: ""What they should specialize in during their studies, whether they might want to go abroad and start a job or an apprenticeship there."" Nothing new could be said."
22180	17	But the way to the goal is ingenious: »To clarify that and to find yourself, you need freedom.«
22180	19	"Consequently, most young people refuse to be committed to a year of service. ""Why is that?"" asks the student, who is doing well at school and later at university at the expense of the older generation. »Certainly because many older people want to determine and control the lives of future generations. And the fact that the coercion – and with it the restriction of freedom – would only affect the younger ones.”"
22180	21	"And yet the Miss needs a moral justification for a life free of work at the expense of others who go to work. This is the biggest bang in the tangled web of thoughts of Raggamby's Alma. Young people, she claims, don't need to go to work because they're already doing something: ""They're already very committed anyway, fighting for a more social society, opposing climate change. They shouldn't be required to do a year's community service as well."""
22181	3	"""The fire-dangerous excesses of rampant illegal mass immigration is shown by the seizure of forty heavily armed migrants shortly before the Hungarian border,"" said FPÖ security spokesman NAbg today. Hannes Amesbauer worried about the corresponding media reports and continued: ""It makes it clear how negligent and irresponsible the 'ÖVP asylum propaganda' is. On the one hand, constantly flooding the headlines with edgy but insubstantial statements and, on the other hand, burying one's head in the sand and hiding behind the crashing failure of EU migration policy and Union law is simply no longer possible in view of the dynamic developments. Either the currently incumbent ÖVP Interior Minister Karner finally does his job or he resigns."
22181	5	"""What else has to happen for the black-green federal government to finally understand that things can't go on like they are now?"" Amesbauer asked himself. “We have already let well over 30,000 illegal immigrants into the country this year. There are now estimates that there will be 70,000 or more by the end of the year. These are dimensions like in the horror year 2015,"" emphasized the liberal security spokesman, who also recalled that at that time even under red-black an upper limit of 37,500 asylum applications per year was introduced in order to ensure the maintenance of public security and order as well as social peace to ensure the functioning of state institutions. ""This already very high upper limit was already exceeded in 2021 with almost 40,000 asylum applications and will be literally pulverized this year,"" says Amesbauer."
22182	3	Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said a few days ago that depending on the conditions under which the Russian military operation in Ukraine ends, NATO's role in Europe could weaken or strengthen. According to him, the military conflict can end in three ways.
22182	5	Influential international relations expert and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger set out his perspective in an interview with British magazine The Spectator published on July 2. He listed three options for the conflict, each of which he believes is still possible:
22182	7	"First, if the Russian military maintains its current positions, ""it will retain 20 percent of Ukraine and most of Donbass, the main industrial and agricultural areas, and a strip of land along the Black Sea,"" Kissinger said. In his opinion, this will be a victory for Russia ""despite all the failures it suffered at the beginning"" and NATO's role ""will not be as crucial"" as before."
22182	9	"Second possibility: Russia could be “expelled” from the territories it took control of in 2014, including Crimea. Then, according to Henry Kissinger, ""the question of war with Russia itself will arise."""
22182	11	"Third possibility: If Ukraine ""can prevent Russia from a military conquest and the ""front line is pushed back to the February 24 borders, it will mean a loss for the Russian Federation. Ukraine will be restored to the form it was at the start of the war: the post-2014 battle line. It will be rearmed and closely associated with, if not part of, NATO. The remaining issues could be resolved through negotiation. It would be a situation that freezes for a while. But as we have seen with the reunification of Europe, they can be achieved over time,"" said the former diplomat and adviser to US presidents."
22182	13	"Kissinger is convinced that the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskij subscribes to the third scenario. In that case, NATO would only get stronger with Finland and Sweden joining, and Ukraine ""would have the largest conventional ground forces in Europe,"" the former foreign minister added. The Ukrainian army will also be the only one in Europe with experience fighting an enemy at high intensity - a trait that European armies have lacked for decades."
22182	15	Russia will be shown that the fear of the arrival of Russian armies that has plagued Europe since World War II can be allayed through NATO's conventional measures. For the first time in recent history, Russia will be confronted with the need to coexist with Europe as a whole and not with America, which plays the main role in defending Europe with the help of nuclear forces,” added Henry Kissinger.
22182	17	"Last May, at the Davos forum, the former foreign minister called for pressure on Ukraine to resume talks with Russia and to end attempts to inflict a ""crushing defeat"" on Russian troops to maintain a ""way out"" for Russia. Kissinger had urged the US and the West not to seek an embarrassing Russian defeat in Ukraine, warning that doing so could harm Europe's long-term stability. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had criticized this approach."
22182	19	"In June, Kissinger said he supports a NATO deal on the situation in Ukraine. He also believed that Russia must ""find a place"" after the end of hostilities, otherwise the country will become an outpost of China in Europe. The former diplomat is referring to the ""places"" that were assigned to former adversaries after the major conflicts in order to restore a stable international order: Louis XVIII's France. at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, West Germany and Japan after 1945. Many see the 1990s as lost as the West failed to integrate Russia into the Western system, leaving it in economic, social and security chaos. Then, in the 2000s and 2010s, Moscow restored its power, thanks to the financial resources of its oil, gas and mining exports, but also due to a power politics completely taken over by the Russian state."
22182	21	Henry Kissinger turned 99 in May. The influential expert on international relations, who is regarded as an advocate of the realistic current, was US Secretary of State from 1973 to 1977 under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He was also from 1969 to 1975 national security adviser to these presidents.
22184	3	Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Berlin (dpo) - Will the chaos at German airports soon be history? Instead of looking for staff on the empty job market or abroad, more and more airports are now starting to hire stranded vacationers who have the time anyway.
22184	5	"Hajo Kleibert from the operating company of Düsseldorf Airport is pleased that we didn't think of it earlier! ""Thousands of vacationers are sitting around at our airport and have nothing to do but wait while we are desperately looking for staff. The solution was so obvious!"""
22184	7	In the meantime, professional recruiters go from group to group of holidaymakers and ask who wants to lend a hand. The postillon was on site in Düsseldorf and was able to observe the practice live.
22184	9	"Hi! You're waiting for flight 4103 to Tenerife, aren't you? airport staff recruiter Tamara Klowanski addresses a larger group in brightly colored vacation attire. ""Unfortunately nothing is happening today."" General moaning. ""Yes, it sucks. I know. But: Would you like to earn a little extra money until tomorrow? We need a few more people to unload suitcases, two for security and a bus driver for the tarmac. 13 euros an hour. Who up for it?"" At first a few hesitantly reported, then more, finally almost everyone."
22184	11	"In confidence, Klowanski tells us what to look out for. ""So basically we take everyone, but you should be a bit careful who does what. Don't use seniors to balance suitcases. And never give drunk Malle tourists the flags to show them the planes. We had to learn that painfully in some cases. """
22184	13	"The reasons why so many holidaymakers pitch in are very different. The postilion asked some of them: ""Yes, well, if my vacation here is already wasted, then I want to at least earn a little money for my next vacation,"" explains Jasmin Streubeck (39) from Wuppertal. ""I guess I'll do a double shift check-in desk at the gate or something. The briefing will start soon."""
22184	15	"For Elliot S. (21) from Cologne, other things are in the foreground: ""I do security checks. You only get minimum wage there, but I was told I can keep any drugs I find. I won't say no."""
22185	3	Berlin (dpo) - done! A hamster buyer from the first Corona wave used up his last pack of pasta today. The extension to his house, in which he has been hoarding toilet paper since the beginning of 2020, is finally empty.
22185	5	"But that took a while, says Peter Kolb happily, while the last spaghetti noodles disappear into his mouth. ""I'm really not going to eat pasta for a while now. I'm really sick of that stuff."""
22185	7	"For each of his three daily meals, Kolb had consistently used pasta as the main ingredient for the past two years. ""You just have to be a little creative,"" he explains. ""I've made everything: pasta soup, pasta pudding, pasta muesli, pasta with sauce, pasta without sauce, spaghetti ice cream, pasta in a dressing gown, pasta goulash, pasta burgers, tortellini filled with pasta..."""
22185	9	"Now the 58-year-old can finally use other carbohydrate sources again. ""In the meantime I no longer knew what rice or potatoes tasted like,"" says Kolb, whose first meal without pasta consisted of a lentil casserole with bread puree. ""Now I have to learn how to do it all without pasta,"" he admits."
22185	11	"Not only is Kolb rid of his noodles now – his supply of toilet paper has also finally been used up. ""I still think the stuff is ok, although I used it practically every day."""
22185	13	"So today he wants to buy toilet paper again for the first time in over two years. ""But only one pack. Hach, how exciting!"""
22186	3	Hamburg (dpo) - Everyone knows that cruises are bad for the environment. The tour operator TUI Cruises now wants to change that and today ceremoniously sent the first completely CO2-free pedal cruise ship on its maiden voyage.
22186	5	"The 'Mein Tretschiff 1' is the first cruise ship that manages completely without burning environmentally harmful ship diesel, explains TUI spokesman Jens Petralke. ""We rely completely on a technology that has been known from pedal boats for decades."""
22186	7	Since the ship is not exactly light with a weight of 111,500 tons, about 50 percent of all almost 3,000 passengers have to pedal below deck to drive the large paddle wheel in the stern.
22186	9	"That amounts to two six-hour shifts per passenger every day, says Petralke. ""The rest of the time you can have fun on deck and enjoy the fresh, diesel-free sea air."""
22186	11	"Karl (66) and Sabine Römerlein (65) are passengers on the maiden voyage and describe their first impressions. ""It's really great that it's CO2-free,"" explains Sabine, while sweating as she pedals. We also think of our grandchildren when we do something like this. Tell me Karl! You're not really stepping along! Now make an effort. We only do three and a half hours and want to arrive in Copenhagen today."""
22187	2	On August 4th, Viktor Orbán will travel to the USA - as a guest speaker of the Republican Party. Hungary serves as a role model for the conservatives as to how the political system in the USA could soon function
22187	4	Viktor Orbán is getting around quite a bit this summer. Just the week before last, the Hungarian prime minister gave a speech in Băile Tușnad, Romania, in which he spoke of race and miscegenation; Last Thursday he was in Vienna at Ballhausplatz with Chancellor Karl Nehammer (ÖVP), where he honestly pretended that nothing had happened. And then this week Dallas, Texas.
22187	6	"Wherever he goes, his mission remains the same. The ""great, historic battle"" is what drives him, and by that he doesn't mean Europe's relationship with Russia or even China. Orbán's fight takes place in the field of ""demographics, migration, gender""."
22187	8	While the EU Commission sniffs, overseas people are following closely what is going on in Hungary. For the US Republicans, the small country is a kind of laboratory. The conservative struggle is being fought successfully here, Orbán is a political role model. His ideological lining could also be used for the presidential elections
22188	1	My plane is powered by pinwheels! – Merz rejects climate criticism
22188	3	Arnsberg (dpo) - After criticism of his private flight from the Sauerland to Christian Lindner's wedding on Sylt, Friedrich Merz is now defending himself: There can be no question of environmental damage and fuel waste, according to the CDU boss.
22188	5	"Maybe all the critics should have just taken a closer look at my DA62, Merz explained to the postillon. ""It's driven by two wind turbines, which rotate incredibly fast throughout the flight."""
22188	7	"He always thought that greens would totally love something like that, says Merz. ""And now that shouldn't be right again?"""
22189	3	Munich (dpo) - Better safe than sorry: Because he fears that Germany's gas supplies will run out in winter, Markus Patz from Munich started storing gas himself in his kitchen today.
22189	5	"You never know how much longer it will come out of the pipe, explains the 52-year-old, while fully opening the valve on his gas stove. ""That's why I'd rather bunker a bit. Here in the kitchen alone, 20 cubic meters of gas fit easily. That'll get me through the worst of it if the supply collapses."""
22189	7	"He opens some kitchen cupboards and waves a piece of cardboard to the shelves. ""Here I fill everything up to be on the safe side. Gas doesn't go bad and a lot helps a lot."""
22189	9	"After about an hour, Patz turns off the gas again. ""Well, that should be enough. I'm already feeling dizzy. Building up supplies is quite exhausting, I'm just realizing."""
2219	3	In Davos and beyond, NATO's optimistic narrative plays like a broken record that never changes its tune as Russia wins victories on the ground that could topple the Atlantic order.
2219	5	Three months after the start of Russia's Operation Z in Ukraine, the West's (12 percent) battle against the rest (88 percent) continues to escalate. But the narrative remains – oddly enough – the same.
2219	7	"On Monday in Davos, World Economic Forum CEO Klaus Schwab introduced Ukrainian comedian and President Volodymyr Zelensky to a glowing tribute on the final leg of his gun poaching tour. Mr Schwab stressed that an actor playing a president who defends neo-Nazis has the support of ""all of Europe and the international order""."
2219	9	By that, of course, he means all but the 88 percent of the planet who subscribe to the rule of law — and not the fictional construct the West calls the “rules-based international order.”
2219	11	Back in the real world, Russia has slowly but surely rewritten the art of hybrid warfare. But amidst the carnival of NATO psychopaths, aggressive cognitive infiltration, and startling media cringing, the new US $40 billion “aid package” to Ukraine, which is believed to be able to start war, is getting a lot of coverage change decisively.
2219	13	"This ""game-changing"" narrative comes from the same people who burned trillions of dollars to secure Afghanistan and Iraq. And we've seen how that turned out."
2219	15	Ukraine is the holy grail of international corruption. That $40 billion can only make a difference for two groups of people: first, the US military-industrial complex, and second, a bunch of Ukrainian oligarchs and neocon NGOs who dominate the black market in arms and humanitarian aid, and then the profits in the Cayman Islands will wash.
2219	17	"A quick breakdown of the $40 billion shows that $8.7 billion went to the US arms stockpile (which doesn't go to Ukraine at all), $3.9 billion to USEUCOM (the ""bureau"" that Kyiv controls the military tactics dictated), $5 billion for a hazy, unspecified ""global food supply chain"", $6 billion for actual weapons and ""education"" for Ukraine, $9 billion for ""economic aid"" (which will disappear into select pockets), and $0 $.9 billion earmarked for refugees."
2219	19	US risk agencies have downgraded Kyiv to the non-repayable debt heap, leaving major American investment funds out of Ukraine, leaving the European Union (EU) and its member states as the country's only option.
2219	21	Few of these countries, apart from Russophobic states like Poland, can justify to their own people giving large sums of direct aid to a failed state. Therefore, it will be up to the Brussels-based EU machine to do just enough to keep Ukraine in an economic coma, regardless of any contribution from member states and institutions.
2219	23	These EU “loans” – mostly in the form of arms deliveries – can always be repaid through Kiev's wheat exports. This is already happening on a small scale via the port of Constanta in Romania, where Ukrainian wheat is barged across the Danube and loaded onto dozens of cargo ships daily. Or about truck convoys loaded with weapons against wheat. However, Ukrainian wheat will continue to feed the rich West, not impoverished Ukrainians.
22190	3	Bonn (dpo) - After more and more large forest fires made headlines in recent weeks, a new study by the European Forest Institute (EFI) is now creating some hope: According to this, fewer and fewer forests can burn down in future, the more forests burn down.
22190	5	"Fire needs food, explains forest fire expert Faustine Deniau. ""And it is precisely this food that is deprived of future forest fires with every forest fire. The forest protects itself from burning, so to speak, by being no longer there."""
22190	7	"It usually takes decades before a piece of forest that has just burned down can catch fire again. ""Seen in this way, forest fires are excellent fire protection for nature - or what is left of it, even in the long term,"" says Deniau."

22194	4	So, that's enough!: Queen reintroduces absolute monarchy
22194	6	London (dpo) - Enough is enough! In view of the chaotic state of affairs in British politics, Queen Elizabeth II has spoken a word of power today: As the 96-year-old announced in a TV speech, the parliamentary monarchy will be converted back to an absolute monarchy with immediate effect.
22194	8	"I've watched this ridiculous democracy circus long enough and I'm not amused, said the visibly angry Queen in her speech to her subjects. ""Scandals, countless resignations, cabinet reshuffles, Brexit, motions of no confidence, early elections... Enough!"""
22194	10	In the future, therefore, the Queen's sure hand will again determine all political issues - Parliament is thus completely disempowered. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and scores of other politicians and ministers were jailed by members of the Queen's Guard.
22194	12	"The restoration of the absolute monarchy is legally secured by an additional article of the Magna Carta. The relevant passage says: ""(...) if þe Pryme Ministre fucketh uppe majorly, þe Kynge or Qween shall regaine thereupon His or Her powre and rule as in olde tymes (...)"""
22194	14	The inaugural speech of the newly crowned sole ruler revealed numerous innovations in the political orientation of the United Kingdom: The new main foreign policy goal is to regain the territories lost to archenemy France in the Hundred Years' War between 1337 and 1453 - if necessary by force of arms.
22195	3	Brussels (dpo) - Good news for men over 40! The EU Parliament today confirmed that white socks with sandals are to be classified as sexy in the future. The historic decision came right after the decision to classify nuclear power and gas as sustainable.
22195	5	"Sorry but how can you not think that's hot? explained Spanish EPP MEP Iker Espinoza while lifting a foot to reveal tennis socks worn in sandals. ""It's time for Europe to recognize that. For too long, sneaker or flip-flop fans have wanted to decide for themselves what's sexy and what's not."""
22195	7	"The current decision is the culmination of a long campaign: For years, large socks and sandal manufacturers have been campaigning for the European Union to recognize the erotic appeal of the clothing combination in the so-called ""legal act on sexynomy""."
22195	9	In practice, the classification of white socks in sandals as sexy means that socks-in-sandals wearers must be taken into account when awarding public compliments in the future.

22197	4	is it magic Opponents and proponents of measures see themselves completely confirmed by the Corona expert council
22197	6	Berlin (dpo) - Finally the experts agree! After the presentation of the eagerly awaited evaluation of the corona measures by the Federal Government's Council of Experts, both opponents and supporters of the measures see themselves completely confirmed by the report.
22197	8	"In my view, this can only be explained by magic or a rift in the space-time continuum, according to media scientist Martina Engelbert. ""Just a few seconds after the evaluation became known, tens of thousands of people in the media and social networks unanimously declared that they felt their positions were 100 percent confirmed by the Corona Expert Council."""
22197	10	For example, the “Bild” newspaper, which was critical of the measures, immediately stated that the expert council had declared all measures to be almost ineffective (corona clap for “team caution”).
22197	12	"How can both be true? Engelbert asks. ""In the end, only metaphysical explanations come into question."""
222	3	After his divisive statements in the corona crisis, many would hardly have believed the controversial pontiff capable of this attempt at conciliatory words. In an interview with the Italian newspaper “Corriere della Sera”, Pope Francis criticized the NATO provocations for the first time. He wants to work for an end to the war - and is therefore of the opinion that he should first speak to Putin before traveling to Kyiv to see Zelensky. The Bishop of Rome thinks little of the rearmament and the many arms deliveries.
222	4	“Barking NATO” as a provocation for the attack
222	6	"Born in Argentina and sitting at the Holy See since 2013, he is certain that a piece of wood alone cannot burn. He told the Italian daily: ""Perhaps it was NATO's barking at the gates of Russia that prompted Putin to invade Ukraine. I can't say if his anger was provoked, but I suspect that the attitude of the West encouraged it."" At the same time, he believes that the Ukrainians' right to defend themselves is compatible with Catholic social teaching."
222	8	"However, he tried to find common ground with Kirill, the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. In the first half of the 40-minute video conference between the two church leaders, he defended the justifications for the Russian “special operation”, as Moscow calls the armed conflict in the neighboring country. Here the Pope was critical: “Brother, we are not state clerics. We cannot speak the language of politics, but that of Jesus."""
222	9	International interests: Third World War looms
222	11	With this, Francis connects the unconditional mandate of organized Christianity to work for an end to the war: “We must find ways to peace.” He pointed out that he had already made an offer to talks to Putin in March, but that he has not yet accepted the offer. What the Pope regrets is that, in his view, the only way to end the conflict is through talks. He therefore repeated his offer – without too much hope: “We are pressing ahead, although I fear that Putin cannot and does not want to have this meeting at the moment.”
222	13	But the first way would lead to Russia – for this reason Francis excludes a trip to Kyiv for the time being: “First I have to go to Moscow, first I have to meet Putin.” He called the Ukraine war a proxy conflict. He warned of the outbreak of a global war. Its harbingers can also be found elsewhere: “We are moving towards a third world war. In Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Africa, one conflict follows another. And in that one of them, international interests are at stake.” In the current Ukraine war, too, “other states” had fueled the escalation.
222	14	Only a few dare to protest against rearmament
222	16	Pope Francis had already spoken out against armament and warmongering in recent weeks - but never so clearly. This time he also openly criticized the armaments industry and both sides of the war: “What seems undisputed is that both sides are trying out new weapons. The Russians, for example, have just found out that tanks are useless and may be developing new weapons. Wars are also waged so that the parties to the conflict can test their arsenals of weapons.”
222	18	"This is already historically verifiable - for example in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) or in the Second World War (1939-45). For Francis, the war is a terrible activity: “The production and sale of armaments is a disgrace. But few are brave enough to fight back.” The fact that he recently described the escalation in Ukraine as a ""fratricidal war"" brought him a lot of criticism in the Eastern European country. About 6 percent of Ukrainians, mostly in the West, are Catholic. The dominant church there follows the Byzantine rite, but is subject to Rome according to canon law."
2220	1	New pipeline: Turkey and Israel want to rid Europe of Putin gas
2220	3	"Israel and Turkey are said to be negotiating a new natural gas project behind closed doors in order to ""liberate Europe from Putin's clutches"". For Turkey, the project is another step towards becoming an influential energy hub. It brings in good money for the project operators in Israel. Europe will have little of it. The expected delivery quantities are too small and the construction will take years. In any case, Europe should be cut off from Putin gas by any means necessary. Behind this are massive efforts by the USA to control Europe's energy supply. Pipelines play an important role in this."
2220	5	Specifically, it is about the oil field Leviathan, off the coast of Israel. From there, an underwater pipeline is to go to Turkey and from there deliver gas to neighboring southern European countries. Leviathan is operated by American Chevron and Israel NewMed Energy and Ratio Oil. Production there began at the end of 2019 after some teething problems, including environmental concerns. The pipeline is currently delivering natural gas to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. It is planned to increase annual production from 12 to 21 billion cubic meters and to export this amount to Europe. If one considers that the European Union imports 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia every year and this amount corresponds to only 40 percent of consumption, it becomes clear that the possible construction of a natural gas pipeline between Israel and Turkey will only marginally reduce dependency on Russia.
2220	7	"The project is surprising because Turkish-Israeli relations are not necessarily friendly. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan apparently wants to change that. He said gas cooperation is ""one of the most important joint steps for bilateral relations."" He is ready to send senior ministers to Israel to revive the longstanding pipeline idea. However, the construction of the pipeline would take years. Israel's energy minister, Karine Elharrar, was skeptical: Many issues, including financial issues, have not yet been discussed. The project must be economically viable, that is not ""certain"" at the moment. The industry is also skeptical. She fears the project could fall through because of production restrictions and geopolitical issues."
2220	9	Turkey requires 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually and imports almost all of its fossil fuel from Russia and Azerbaijan via pipelines. Due to its geopolitical position, it is in an advantageous position as a natural gas distribution base. Relations with Putin are neutral. In 2016, the two countries decided to build the TurkStream pipeline. It runs from Russia via Turkey to a terminal on the Black Sea coast and is connected to Bulgaria. Gas has been flowing to Sofia since early 2020. The pipeline bypasses Ukraine as a transit route for supplies to Europe. The EU and US are not happy about it. Of course it makes sense for Turkey to get cheap gas from Russia, but that will probably be subject to conditions, it said. And that could become a problem for the EU, according to Brussels.
2220	11	"The US plays a key role in deciding on pipeline projects. It has already brought down or blocked a number of projects. Because Europe should remain under US control to prevent the emergence of a Eurasian economic bloc together with the hated, resource-rich Russia. That would make the US a geopolitical dwarf. Washington only recently showed how this works: At the beginning of April, the responsible US Secretary, Victoria Nuland, during a visit to Greece, declared the EastMed pipeline project between Israel, Cyprus and Greece, which was ready to be signed, to be pointless and too lengthy. You need the gas now, it's about a ""green future"" and you have to use liquid gas (LNG). It's clear where this is supposed to come from: by slingshot tankers across the Atlantic at a price that is far higher than Russian gas. Talks about the 1,900-kilometer pipeline, which would have cost the EU many billions of euros, began in 2014. It would have run from Israel's Mediterranean coast to Cyprus and from there delivered gas to Greece and Italy. It should be signed in January 2020. But Brussels was skeptical as to whether the whole thing would pay off. The USA has now spoken a word of power."
2221	3	Of course, Western media don't report on this, because then many of their lies would collapse. Incidentally, the pranksters have shown that Western media such as Bloomberg are by no means independent of the government, but spread lies when necessary on behalf of their government. This is no joke, you can find the details here.
2221	5	During a phone call with the OSCE chair, the pranksters revealed that the OSCE is no longer a neutral organization, but has long since become an instrument of the West. In another conversation, representatives of the USA openly divulged how they support radical opposition figures in Russia in order to enable regime change in Moscow, which the USA is currently vehemently denying. The Western media could not quote this nonsense from the US government without comment if their readers knew about the phone call.
2221	7	Norbert Röttgen has also been tricked by the Russian boys. Apparently he was so embarrassed that he made sure that YouTube no longer shows the video in Germany while it was still available outside of Germany. At least that was the case until YouTube completely deleted the channel where the pranksters published the video.
2221	9	Now the boys have struck again, and this time their victim was former US President George Bush Jr. Bush was very open about this, believing he was going to speak to Ukrainian President Zelensky. Bush openly admitted many things that he would certainly not tell journalists. Perhaps most importantly at the moment, Bush has openly acknowledged the existence of US bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine, while the US government denies their existence and there is talk of Russian propaganda in the West. Is Bush now a Russian propagandist?
2222	3	It is not reported in the west, but Poland's president spoke openly in a speech about Poland's ambitions to annex parts of western Ukraine.
2222	5	"I have already reported that in Russia it was reported that there are ambitions in Poland to occupy parts of western Ukraine that Poland considers to be its historical possessions. Poland wants to send ""peacekeeping forces"" to Ukraine for this purpose, but the US has clearly said that in the event of a clash with the Russian military, Poland need not hope for NATO protection, because it would not be a Russian attack on Poland if Poland entered the country invaded Ukraine."
2223	3	According to Moscow, the Russian armed forces simulated an attack with nuclear-capable missiles during an exercise in Königsberg. In Lithuania, the Baltic states are seen as the first target for tactical nuclear weapons
2223	5	"Around 100 soldiers simulated an “electronic launch” of the Iskander mobile ballistic missile system, which can fire nuclear-tipped missiles, the Defense Ministry in Moscow announced on May 4. The armed forces reportedly practiced how to engage military targets of an imaginary enemy and how to respond to a retaliatory strike. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled several times since the start of the war against Ukraine that he is ready to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons. At the end of February, Russia put its nuclear forces on increased alert. The Kremlin chief has also warned of ""lightning-speed"" retaliation if the West intervenes directly in the Ukraine conflict. In recent days, Russian state television has increasingly tried to make the use of nuclear weapons socially acceptable in public. ""For two weeks we have been hearing from our television stations that we have to open nuclear missile warheads,"" said Russian journalist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov."
2223	7	Limited nuclear war in 2022?
2223	9	In Lithuania, one wonders why this exercise took place in the Russian enclave of Königsberg, when this enclave does not even cover 0.1 percent of the area of ​​Russia, especially since it is certain that in an emergency the Russian armed forces would not launch the rockets from this area shoot at Ukraine. Because then they would have to fly at least partially over NATO airspace and could therefore trigger the defense case. Even in this case, Lithuania does not believe that the USA or Great Britain will directly launch a counterattack against the Koenigsberg region or any other place in Russia with tactical nuclear weapons, because this would undoubtedly lead to an escalation.
2223	11	According to the war game scenarios known so far, a tactical nuclear strike against Russian military facilities in Belarus, Russia's closest ally, would be more likely. Especially since Belarus had already appealed to Putin in January to station nuclear weapons there again, even though the country, together with Ukraine and Kazakhstan, had renounced nuclear weapons in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. The US National Security Council does not consider a nuclear retaliatory strike to be necessary for military expediency anyway, but for political reasons. The USA, as the first nuclear power, would thus demonstrate that it still has a special responsibility as a global center of power from the development of this weapon and from being the first power to use it. Nuclear overkill would only be possible if Putin reacted to this nuclear retaliatory strike against Belarus.
2225	3	"I have repeatedly pointed out that Vladimir Putin bears great resemblances to George W. Bush. Putin was a mediocre figure in the KGB, Bush comes from a CIA (Skull & Bones) family. Both only became popular after staged terrorist attacks, both waged a brutal ""war on Islamic terror"". Bush had bin Laden, Putin had Shamil Basayev. Both could be marketed with a cowboy image and a commander's image. Even though Bush was AWOL at the time. Putin has no military experience. Bush had the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act. Under Putin, there were massive legal tightening. Both had established systems behind them."
2226	3	Omicron is the name of the Corona variant, which is currently causing massive concern among politicians, the media and the population. Gradually, however, the data are accumulating, according to which possible diseases are mild. The virologist Klaus Stöhr even sees the end of the pandemic coming.
2226	5	"South African scientists had scarcely informed the world of the identification of variant B.1.1.529 when the head of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, drew a comparison between the variant known as Omicron and the equally rare and extremely life-threatening infectious disease Ebola. Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach already reported at the beginning of December that ""the Omicron variant in particular is particularly dangerous for children""."
2226	7	"It was the expert Prof. Klaus Stöhr who contradicted Lauterbach: ""From my perspective, there are no findings from the preliminary data that even approximately allow the conclusion that children are affected by severe courses of Omicron""."
2226	9	"At the same time, South African doctors in particular warned against unjustified ""hysteria"" from the start, given the usually obviously mild course of the disease after an omicron infection. The South African physician and chairwoman of the South African Medical Association, known as the ""omicron discoverer"", Dr. Angelique Coetzee also warned:"
2226	11	"""If we overreact, we risk missing out on the benefits of a variant that could be more of a friend than an enemy."""
2226	13	Since then, there has also been increasing recognition in Germany that Omikron actually results in milder infection processes compared to the Delta variant. But the sheer number of positive tests due to the pathogen, which is even easier to transmit, could destroy this encouraging glimmer of hope and thus lead to hospital capacities being overloaded, it is now said.
2226	15	Prof. Klaus Stöhr was now convinced on n-tv in this context:
2226	17	"""It's heading towards the end of the pandemic."""
2226	19	"The hospitalization rate for Omikron is about the same as for the Delta variant - despite a significantly higher transmission rate, according to the renowned virologist and epidemiologist. In South Africa, but also in Great Britain, studies pointed out ""that about four times more cases occur due to omicrons, but at the same time only a quarter as many people are hospitalized"". Despite increasing incidences, the ""pressure on the hospitals"" remains the same."
2226	21	"""That's why I would think it would be good if the reporting not only talked about the increasing cases - these are often mild illnesses, asymptomatic - but also reported at the same time, as is the trend in Germany now, the pressure on the intensive care units decreases, the hospitalization rate decreases."""
2226	23	Stöhr is convinced that this is good news. In fact, the hospitalization rate should replace the 7-day incidence as an indicator for the corona events in Germany and from now on be decisive for the imposition or lifting of corresponding measures. The federal and state governments had agreed on this in mid-November.
2226	25	The so-called hospitalization incidence indicates how many people per 100,000 inhabitants have to be treated in hospital because of Corona. Despite the falling hospital incidence, measures to protect the health of the population have been tightened since then. In addition, there are reports that suggest a strong distortion of the hospitalization incidence.
2226	27	"Research by Welt am Sonntag recently brought to light ""misunderstandings"" between clinics and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), for example when it came to the question of how many ""corona patients"" COVID-19 was actually the main diagnosis and at how many it was just a secondary diagnosis. As a result, the confusion ""led to an overestimation of the incidence of hospitalization""."
2226	29	"According to Stöhr, it is now a matter of planning the further steps in the fight against the pandemic ""very sensibly"". Based on current studies on Omikron, it is now necessary to adapt your own policy of measures, for example in the areas of quarantine and contact restrictions. ""Of course, the contagion is not an option,"" says Stöhr."
2226	31	"""You have to keep thinking about contact reduction. The burden of disease has to be further reduced."""
2226	33	"However, it is crucial to now deal with the current situation of a ""virus that is better adapted to humans"" - also against the background of the not inconsiderable vaccination rate and ""natural immunization""."
2227	3	Water scarcity and drought are among the greatest challenges facing humanity today. As a result of global warming, the destruction of ecosystems and wasteful industrial and agricultural practices, billions of people will live in water-scarce areas in the next few years. At least 26 million people are currently struggling to survive in the Horn of Africa after consecutive bad rainy seasons. Drought conditions in northern Kenya, much of Somalia and southern Ethiopia are expected to persist through at least mid-2022, claiming lives. The situation is already so dire that wild animals are dying by the hundreds and pastoralists are reporting losses of up to 70% of their livestock.
2227	5	"Even a glance at recent headlines is a bleak reminder that South Africa is at the forefront of a global water crisis. While golf courses and hotel complexes boast green lawns, the poor suffer from a lack of water. Many countries around the world are suffering from a water crisis, 17 countries are on the verge of ""Day Zero"", but nowhere is it clearer than in Africa - if you can afford water, you can get it. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in arid regions, including Europe. Over the next century, the likelihood of cross-border conflicts over water could increase by 95%. The increasing level of pollution, the ever-growing population and climate change combine to produce far from optimal conditions in which we can survive. The odds of survival sound daunting."
2228	3	"""Western propaganda has failed,"" the Kremlin claims. Shortly after media reports suggested that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, Moscow announced it would withdraw all troops from the border, then claimed that ""Western propaganda"" had failed."
2228	5	"Goaded by the Biden administration, major news outlets such as The Sun reported that the invasion was scheduled for tomorrow, with a ""massive missile attack"" planned, along with 200,000 troops on standby."
2228	7	But within hours, it seemed like the media had skipped over the story.
2228	9	Major General Igor Konashenkov announced that he would begin withdrawing all Russian troops from the border region.
2228	11	"""As always, when the armed forces complete their military exercises, they will undertake a multimodal march back to their permanent bases,"" Konashenkov explained."
2228	13	"""The South and West Military District divisions have completed their tasks and have already begun loading rail and automobile transport and will begin withdrawing to their military garrisons today."""
2228	15	Russia also released video clips showing armor being loaded into railroad cars on the way back home.
2228	17	Kremlin officials saw the troop withdrawal as evidence of a propaganda victory against the US and NATO.
2228	19	"Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day when Western war propaganda failed,"" she wrote, adding that the West ""was shamed and destroyed without."" fire a single shot""."
2228	21	"White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan breathlessly told CNN on Sunday that the agency had indicated ""major military action"" could ""commence any day."""
2228	23	"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had also declared that February 16, the day the Biden administration claimed Russia was planning an invasion, would be a national ""Day of Unity."" (A war with Russia would be unlike anything what the US and NATO have ever experienced)"
2228	25	The comments were subsequently picked up by US media and released without an ounce of skepticism, prompting a sell-off in stock markets and a rush for gold and crude oil.
2228	27	"Zelenskyy was then forced to backtrack and claim his comments were made ""with irony."""
2228	29	"""Hysteria"" about Russia's attack on Ukraine - Lavrov speaks of ""information terrorism"
2228	31	"According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russian forces are returning to their permanent bases as planned, regardless of Western ""hysteria"" over an alleged invasion of Ukraine. In his view, ""information terrorism"" is being sparked around this topic."
2228	33	"At a meeting with Poland's Foreign Minister and Acting Chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Zbigniew Rau, the Russian Foreign Minister on Tuesday once again emphasized that Russia is conducting military exercises ""on its own territory"" and ""according to its own plans"". (""What can't you understand? What is unclear here?"" Putin's reckoning with the NATO warmongers! (Video))"
2228	35	"“They begin, progress and end as planned. We have talked about this several times,"" Lavrov said."
2228	37	The same also applies to the exercises in the west of the country, in the Far East or for the joint Russian-Belarusian exercises, which are also developed and carried out strictly according to a previously agreed schedule.
2228	39	"""And this happens regardless of who and what thinks, who and how is hysteria about it, who and how sparks real information terrorism (...)"", stressed the Russian foreign minister."
2228	41	"Lavrov also dismissed as ""speculation"" reports from the West that Russia was using the Russian-Belarusian exercises to ""attack"" Kyiv from the north and ""capture"" it. He explained that these ""paranoid scenarios"" had been published several times in the media - ""and in the serious ones at that""."
2229	3	It's not just about preventing attacks in the context of the Corona crisis, but about breaking up this framework. When health becomes a German obsession, the country's modern economic, political and cultural fabric is lost.
2229	5	"Mid-March marks the second anniversary of the beginning of the Corona crisis in Germany. ""Only two years?"" some will ask, because it feels much longer. This is certainly due to the fact that this crisis is a constant back and forth, with ever new attempts at the solution, which are then rejected as insufficient. An endless, hopeless construction site. How was it at the beginning?"
2229	7	"The photographs by Bettina Hagen (Tichys Insight 5/2020) show the deserted streets in Hamburg. The first lock down. A spooky wasteland. At that time, the real danger of the virus could not be assessed. It could not be ruled out that it was a highly contagious, deadly virus, comparable to the Ebola virus. Was there a new plague? It was understandable that this situation caused great anxiety. The willingness to endure extreme protective measures was great. The Italian ""Bergamo"" with its overcrowded hospitals, in which people fought for their lives in vain, and the transport of the dead on trucks - these were the images in our heads."
2229	9	What has happened since then? In the whole tangle of events, measures and experiences, two major lines can be seen: On the one hand, the virus has proven to be less dangerous than was initially feared. On the other hand, the protective measures were not scaled back on the same scale. The Corona danger was not reintroduced into the normality of life. To this day, the economy, state and culture, public life and human interaction have not found their way back to their independence and free development.
223	3	This disguise is as obvious as it can be, and shows that the government no longer cares what people think of its totalitarianism, so there seems to be no longer a need to disguise its true agenda.
223	5	"Biden's puppeteers have basically emerged as the tyrants they always were with this new DHS department claiming to be fighting ""disinformation"" online. What they really mean, of course, is that telling the truth will soon be criminalized."
223	7	For some, the truth is already criminalized (e.g. Edward Snowden). It will soon be obvious to many others that anything contrary to political correctness is banned in the land of the free.
223	9	The witch hunt against the truth really picked up speed after Donald Trump was elected President in 2020. Suddenly everything the conservatives said and believed was labeled “Russian disinformation” and the Kremlin was blamed for Trump's victory.
223	11	Now we have Hunter's father, and anti-Russian hostility is in full swing, as is the federal government's crusade against anything that challenges their official history on any given matter.
223	13	"GREENWALD: The label ""disinformation"" is just a cover for authoritarian censorship under a new name"
223	15	"""The same strategic motive - to coat the charge of 'disinformation' with the veneer of expertise - has spawned a new, very well-funded industry that calls itself 'anti-disinformation' scientists,"" explains Glenn Greenwald on Substack."
223	17	“Since Americans are instilled from childhood that censorship is shameful — that it is the hallmark of tyranny — those who wish to censor must find some ennobling rationale to justify it and disguise what it is.”
223	19	Big Tech and Big Government are both on an anti-truth crusade
223	21	There have been many different government censorship programs over the years, many with benevolent names like The Atlantic Council and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
223	23	"""Fact checking"" is another form of censorship that has emerged in recent years, also with the aim of suppressing the truth by branding it ""disinformation."""
223	25	Just as the corporate media have rebranded their partisan experts as “fact-checkers” to disguise their opinions as lofty, apolitical, authoritative decrees of expertise, the term “disinformation expert” is designed to declare ideological views as official truth on behalf of governmental and corporate powerhouses obfuscate,” claims Greenwald.
223	27	“Yet if you subject these groups to even minimal investigative scrutiny, you will find that they are anything but apolitical and neutral. They are often funded by the same small handful of liberal billionaires (like George Soros and Pierre Omidyar), by US, UK or EU state security agencies, and/or by big tech monopolies like Google and Facebook.”
223	29	The notion that institutional authority is the sole authority for establishing truth is fallacious. It gives the propagandists official-sounding titles and makes them appear as experts, when in reality they are there to distract people from truth and critical thinking.
223	31	The fact that the mainstream media has consistently invoked “former intelligence operatives” throughout the Trump administration is an example of how the scam works. What the Biden regime is now doing with its disinformation council is an appeal to false authority.
223	33	"""There is no conceivable circumstance under which a domestic law enforcement agency such as DHS would claim the power to decree truth and falsehood,"" Greenwald warns."
223	35	“US security state officials are not specialized in combating disinformation. The opposite is true: they are trained professional liars whose job it is to concoct and spread disinformation.”
2231	1	Ukraine War: The Insidious Desire to Do Good Right Now
2231	3	After the deaths in Bucha, everyone is calling for NATO troops to be sent to Ukraine.
2231	5	Why are historians still puzzling over how the First World War came about? When the solution is so close.
2231	7	It is easy to understand that it is difficult to understand how it could happen that in the summer of 1914 half of Europe threw itself into a war that it believed would be over by Christmas at the latest and in which each side was firmly convinced to take the field against the tyranny of the wicked men. And then, in 1917, the awakening of a continent in tatters and civil wars against which the 'Great War', as it was called, should be harmless, and economic crises that have carved themselves deeper into the collective memory than plague, cholera and ' Spanish Flu‹.
2231	9	We feel right again, maybe even are right again. So we demand to send troops to Ukraine. Just like we sent fighter jets to Afghanistan and troops. And with some justification, as one can say again today after the Taliban took power. And could say again tomorrow.
2231	11	The Hubris of the West. Wanting to spread the good. An understandable hubris. Any hubris is understandable. Especially those of the good.
2231	13	And what if it really came to the end? – The central, indeed the only question is: Was the First World War worth not having to live in Berlin as in Paris, in Moscow as in Vienna, in New York as in Budapest? And even today it is surprising to hear how few people moved to Zurich or Bern at the time.
2231	15	Isn't a life like Moscow worth risking another Great War? - Yes that's it. Only: it's not that far yet.
2231	17	The pictures from Ukraine are reassuring. Not the ones from Bucha. They show that the Ukraine war is a war like any other, with propaganda and threats against civilians. A ruler willing to lie to the world for weeks and then invade a peaceful neighboring country with his troops will also slaughter civilians. It's just not safe. Even the threatened may lie.
2231	19	The soldiers of Ukraine are reassuring. No store-bought characters who just want a liberator's monthly wages to feed their clan. No defectors to take with you after the trigger. They are real soldiers from a country ready to fight for and for their freedom. That much has been certain since February 24th.
2231	21	And that doesn't need any troops of good from the West, or even from the Midwest. The Ukrainians pushed back the Russians in front of Kyiv and also in front of Kharkiv. A general staff may rant about the planned retreat for as long as it takes. The propaganda too, understandable propaganda, because defeat feels bad. And even Mariupol has held since the day its fall was prophesied.
2231	23	Let's let Ukraine fight this battle alone. Without leaving her alone! We take care of Ukrainian women and children while their husbands fight. And we deliver weapons. Because it is not enough to denounce Putin's war of aggression. Tanks and bombers are only driven out by force and certainly not by appeals.
2231	25	Europe has seen enough world wars. It doesn't need another fourth trigger that is caused by negligence and is self-convinced of the good. And it doesn't need another war in which it fights for others. Let's leave the victory over the Russians to the Ukrainians, which they are fighting for all by themselves. Then they will fulfill their wish for freedom. A freedom that the country and its people more than honestly deserve after 100 years of foreign rule.
2234	3	The only antidote to the propaganda frenzy are the sparse voices of reason, which happen to be Russian and are therefore silenced and/or dismissed.
2234	5	Especially since the start of the GWOT (Global War on Terror) at the turn of the millennium, no one has lost money betting against the toxic combination of hubris, arrogance, and ignorance serially deployed by the Empire of Chaos and Lies.
2234	7	"What passes for ""analysis"" in the sprawling intellectual no-fly zone known as the US think tank country involves wishful thinking, such as Beijing ""believing"" Moscow would play a supporting role in the Chinese century, only to have Russia now on the see geopolitical driver's seat."
2234	9	This is not only a striking example of overt Russophobic/Sinophobic paranoia over the emergence of equal competitors in Eurasia - the primordial Anglo-American nightmare - but also a blatant ignorance of the intricacies of the complex comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and China.
2234	11	While Operation Z is methodically entering Phase 2, the Americans have also—emphatically—initiated their symmetrical Phase 2, which amounts to a de facto outright escalation toward total war, from hybrid to red-hot shades, all by proxy, of course. The notorious Raytheon arms dealer and current Pentagon boss Lloyd Austin set the course in Kyiv:
2234	13	"""We want to weaken Russia to the point where it can no longer do the things it did when it invaded Ukraine."""
2234	15	So that's it: the Empire wants to wipe out Russia. That's it for War Inc.'s unlimited supply of arms to Ukraine, the overwhelming majority of which are to be gutted by Russian precision strikes.
2234	17	The Americans exchange information with Kyiv around the clock not only about Donbass and Crimea, but also about Russian territory. Total War is taking place in parallel with the planned controlled destruction of the EU economy, with the European Commission happily acting as a kind of PR arm of NATO Amid the propaganda dementia and acute cognitive dissonance spreading throughout the NATO sphere, the few voices of reason that happen to be Russian are the only antidote and are therefore silenced and/or dismissed. The West ignores them at its own collective peril.
2234	19	Patrushev makes Triple-X unplugged
2234	21	Let's start with President Putin's speech to the Legislative Council in St. Petersburg on the occasion of the Day of Russian Parliamentarism.
2234	23	Putin demonstrated how a hardly new “geopolitical weapon” that relies on “Russophobia and neo-Nazis” coupled with efforts at “economic strangulation” not only failed to smother Russia, but entrenched a sense of existential conflict in the collective subconscious : a “second great patriotic war”.
2234	25	"With hysteria raging at every level, a message to an empire that still refuses to listen and doesn't even understand the meaning of ""the indivisibility of security"" had to be unavoidable:"
2234	27	"“I would like to emphasize once again that if someone intends to intervene from the outside and make threats of a strategic nature that are unacceptable to Russia, he should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning fast. We have all the tools for it. Those that no one can boast of now. And we won't brag about it. We will use them when necessary. And I want everyone to know - we have all made decisions on this matter."""
2234	29	Translation: The constant provocations may result in Mr. Kinzhal, Mr. Zircon and Mr. Sarmat being forced to present their business cards in selected western latitudes, even without an official invitation.
2234	31	Probably for the first time since Operation Z began, Putin has differentiated between military operations in Donbass and the rest of Ukraine. This is directly related to the ongoing integration of Kherson, Zaporozhye and Kharkov and means that the Russian armed forces are always going further and asserting sovereignty not only over the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, but also over Kherson, Zaporozhye and further down the road from the Azov Sea to the Black Sea to complete control over Nikolayev and Odessa.
2235	3	"In March 2021, the Munich Security Conference, in cooperation with a US security organization, conducted a simulation game that simulated an outbreak of monkeypox in 2022. A few months later, a US vaccine against smallpox was released for the European market. And now, ""surprisingly,"" cases of monkeypox are on the rise. Coincidence or Plandemic?"
2235	5	Business game, vaccine development and outbreak:
2235	7	In November 2021, the US security organization Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) published a report entitled “Strengthening Global Systems to Prevent and Respond to High-Consequence Biological Threats”. This report summarized the results of the 2021 Tabletop Exercise, conducted in partnership with the Munich Security Conference. In this exercise, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) simulated a monkeypox outbreak in 2022.
2235	9	According to the news channel Euronews, a new vaccine against smallpox was developed almost at the same time by a US company with the support of the US government and has now also been approved for Europe. And now cases of monkeypox are suddenly appearing in numerous countries. “Nothing happens by accident in politics. When something happens, you can be sure that it was planned that way,” US President Franklin D. Roosevelt is said to have said. You might also get that impression when you study the coronavirus, swine flu, and now monkeypox.
2236	3	Two studies now suggest that the circulating monkeypox virus was manipulated in a biolab
2236	5	We recently reported that a study published by the Portuguese Institute of Health found abnormal mutations in the supposedly circulating monkeypox virus, suggesting that it was manipulated and processed in a biolab. A second study has now been published that supports this theory.
2236	7	Monkeypox disease usually starts with a fever before developing a rash one to five days later, which often starts on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before eventually forming a scab that later falls off. A person is contagious until all of the scab has fallen off and there is healed skin underneath.
2236	9	The disease has always been extremely rare and was first identified in humans in 1970 in a 9-year-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It was not until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, in the United States, and the disease has never been detected in more than one country at the same time.
2236	11	Until now.
2236	13	A new study published by Portugal's National Institute of Health has provided evidence that the virus responsible for the monkeypox outbreak in Europe, America and Australia was heavily manipulated by scientists in a laboratory and more evidence suggest it was released intentionally.
2236	15	The study was published on May 23, 2022 and can be accessed here.
2236	17	NIH scientists collected and analyzed clinical samples from 9 monkeypox patients between May 15 and 17, 2022.
2236	19	The scientists concluded that the transnational monkeypox outbreak we are now said to be witnessing is most likely due to a single origin, given that all sequenced viruses published to date are closely related.
2236	21	They also concluded that the virus belongs to the West African clade of monkeypox viruses. However, they found that it is most closely related to the monkeypox viruses, which were exported from Nigeria to several countries, namely the UK, Israel and Singapore, in 2018 and 2019.
2236	23	Although the virus is very similar to the 18/19 viruses exported from Nigeria, it differs with more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e. H. genetic variations, nonetheless significant.
2236	25	Richard Neher, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel, has publicly claimed in the mainstream media that -
2236	27	Based on normal evolutionary timelines, scientists would expect a virus like monkeypox to pick up as many mutations in maybe 50 years, not four. That's remarkable.
2236	29	Now a second study has been published, finding something in the virus' supposed genome that shouldn't be there.
2236	31	"The authors of the study are Jean-Claude Perez and Valère Lounnas from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Their study is titled ""May 2022: Peculiar Evolution of the Monkeypox Virus Genomes(link is external)""."
2236	33	Scientists compared the evolution of 14 monkeypox virus genomes with the aim of discovering mutations or other viral evolutions (recombination) that could explain the sudden onset of this very weakly circulating epidemic.
2236	35	"By chance, the scientists discovered that the supposedly circulating monkeypox virus contains a ""30-T long sequence in the middle of the monkeypox genome, between the DNA-dependent RNA and the A-type vaccinia inclusion protein."""
2236	37	Why is that strange? Well, according to the scientists, it's because this never occurs entirely in one sequence. The scientists claim that while they are often found at the end of a genome, e.g. B. at the end of the monkey encephalitis virus, but that they are almost never found completely in one sequence.
2236	39	You can read the full study here.
2236	41	Supposedly for the first time in history there is a monkeypox virus circulating in several first world countries simultaneously and this alleged virus has over 50 mutations that have occurred within 4 years instead of the 50 years it would have taken. And now we know it contains something that just shouldn't be there.
2238	3	The politically correct show at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. As world leaders babble on about a climate allegedly threatened by CO2, they themselves have flown tens of thousands of miles from around the world in private jets.
2238	6	DAVOS – “Climate protector” David Attenborough called on the heads of state and government in Davos to take urgent action against climate change, but apparently nobody was listening. As he spoke, experts were predicting that up to 1,500 (!) private jets will be flying to and from the airfields of the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week.
2238	8	Private jet getting bigger
2238	10	Politicians, business leaders and lobbyists are opting for ever larger and more expensive planes, according to an analysis by the Air Charter Service, which found that the number of private jet flights rose 11% in the past year.
2239	3	Since the end of the corona measures, incidences and deaths have fallen rapidly. Nevertheless, the Greens and Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach are now planning new massive restrictions at high pressure. Why climate change must also be used for this.
2239	5	2G and 3G rules, mandatory tests and mandatory masks should come back. The health policy spokesman for the Greens, Janosch Dahmen, announced this to the newspapers of the Funke media group. Minister of Health Lauterbach is also already working flat out on new restrictions in autumn. He also refers to climate change. In fact, the incidences have been falling to new lows since the end of most corona measures. And the evaluation of the restrictions is not even available.
2239	7	A new wave of infections is expected in the fall, said Dahmen. And for this you have to develop “protective measures” now. Therefore, the Infection Protection Act should be changed in such a way “that the federal and state governments have sufficient measures available for emergencies”. As a precaution, the 2G and 3G rules, the obligation to wear masks indoors and the obligation to test could be reactivated “in good time” in the event of a renewed wave. It remains unclear whether the vaccinated status then only applies to people who have been vaccinated four times.
2239	8	"""Pandemics more likely due to climate change"""
2239	10	"Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has also promised an early concept. He will soon present a ""plan, which I have also coordinated very closely with the Federal Chancellery, on how to manage the pandemic in the fall,"" he announced on Bavarian radio. The politician also referred to climate change. This has health consequences and makes new pandemics more likely."
2239	12	A commission of experts currently has the legal mandate to evaluate the corona measures. By the end of June, it should be determined which restrictions have helped to prevent the virus from spreading and which have not. Neither the Greens nor Lauterbach seem to want to wait for the results.
2239	14	"The FDP has meanwhile criticized the plans. Group leader Christian Dürr told the Funke newspapers: ""There will be no restrictions on freedom with the FDP."" You have to prepare for the fall. ""But for this we don't have to reactivate the measures from the Infection Protection Act, which were not able to contain the last wave."" What is needed, for example, are better digitization, more creative vaccination offers and more prevention in authorities and schools. The recently amended Infection Protection Act expires on September 23."
224	3	"On Wednesday, the EU Parliament passed a draft reform of the European police agency Europol by a vote of 480 to 143 with 20 abstentions. From now on, this has the authority to process extensive and complex data sets in order to support the member states in the fight ""against serious crime and terrorism"" - or against everything that falls under ""national custom"" and national interpretation. In Germany, considering the priorities of a left-wing interior minister, one can be sure that from now on opinion criminals and dissidents criminalized as ""right-wingers"" will also fall into these categories - with the corresponding, now legalized, disenfranchisement consequences."
224	5	"This significantly increases the power of the authority based in The Hague, because Europol is supplied with huge amounts of data primarily by the national law enforcement authorities. The EU data protection officer, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, has long had a thorn in the side of the enormous flow of information that Europol receives: as early as 2020, he had reprimanded the mania for collecting there because even unsuspected persons - such as victims, witnesses or contact persons - ran the risk of being ""illegally involved"". being associated with criminal activity across the EU”. Earlier this year, Wiewiórowski ordered that information about people who could not be proven to be linked to criminal activity must be deleted after six months at the latest. On the one hand, this period enables the authority to “meet the operational requirements of the EU member states”, but on the other hand it would also “minimise the risks to the rights and freedoms of the individual”, according to Wiewiórowski. The fundamental question here is, of course, whether or what is actually “deleted” – and then in a way that cannot actually be reconstructed. There are considerable doubts about this - especially since the Europol data storage is said to include at least four petabytes with tens of billions of information parameters, according to the British ""Guardian"". No authority will part with such a laboriously hoarded ""treasure"" voluntarily - certainly not a non-transparent and only partially democratically legitimized continental police unit."
2240	1	"Climate change: How the ""Spiegel"" calls for left-wing violence"
2240	3	HAMBURG. Attacks on cars in Germany, acts of violence against pipelines - all of this is allowed when it comes to combating climate change. The Trotskyist Andreas Malm is allowed to write that on the Spiegel online site. But that's not enough. It is now, according to the medium, about “the relentless intensification of the actions”.
2240	5	"Under the headline ""Militant climate fighters demand escalation"", the paper publishes a ""contribution to the debate"" that calls for massive violence. In the opening credits, Der Spiegel tries to shirk its responsibility for the pamphlet at least a little by briefly claiming that by publishing the call for violence it is documenting “the world of thought behind it”. If that was a distancing, that was it. Otherwise, the Spiegel reader will be incited against SUV drivers and other alleged ""climate sinners"". It is a call for violence that has probably not been published in an established German medium since the beginning of the RAF terror half a century ago."
2240	7	"The “fossil capital”, writes the Swede Malm in Marxist diction, is “out of control in an infernal and demonic way”. On the other hand, according to the apparent logic of the text, “infernal and demonic” actions are then also legitimate. Referring to various attacks, Malm writes: ""We haven't done enough yet. We have to try harder.” In concrete terms: “We don't need any great concepts to realize that only sabotage and damage to property will help now.” But the so-called “activists” are not to blame. It is “fossil capital itself and the realities it creates that bring us to it”."
2240	9	"Praise for talk of ""green RAF"""
2240	11	Malm has great hopes for Germany and the “millions of striking schoolchildren and sympathetic adults” who started taking action three years ago. They constituted “a considerable reservoir of potential radicalization.” Full of anticipation and indirect prompting, the Trotskyist rhetorically asks, “What will the generation of 2019 do next?” He praises the hunger strike outside the Reichstag, the high-profile roadblocks, and the threat to disrupt air traffic with rising balloons.
2240	13	"He describes the violent German initiative “Ende Gelände” and the group “Fridays for Sabotage” as a “source of inspiration for all of us in Europe”. Malm calls the climate ideologue Tadzio Müller, who was also allowed to talk about a “green RAF” in Der Spiegel, a “brilliant strategist”. And he describes the ""deflating of SUV tires"" as ""a form of extremely peaceful sabotage"". He calls the cars “killer vehicles”. He is happy about ""1000 flattened SUVs""."
2240	15	"And then he talks about what he calls a ""militant attack"" on a pipeline construction site in the United States. 20 people ""armed with axes, flare guns and spray paint"" broke into ""bulldozers and trucks, using them to smash other machinery, generators, heavy equipment and trailers."" But even those are ""no more than small pinpricks"". Therefore, “only one thing can be imagined in the near future: the relentless intensification of actions”."
2240	17	"""Sabotage as a mass movement"""
2240	19	He justifies this again with allegedly legitimate counter-violence of good against evil: “Because the ruling classes refuse to say goodbye to fossil fuels, those who care about a livable planet are forced to up the ante. It should be clear who is responsible for this.”
2241	3	"""It will be more colorful - yes, how wonderful is that?"" - The frenetic jubilation of the old party representatives during the refugee crisis in 2015 seems like sheer mockery today. Because almost 900,000 of the former Merkel migrants live on Hartz IV. Specialists? None! Only 460,000 of the Syrians, Afghans, Somalis or Iraqis who came to the country at the time are currently employed, and mostly only in underskilled jobs. This is reported by the AfD, citing a report by ""Young Freedom""."
2241	5	"The AfD also reports: ""No wonder: Of the 670,000 refugees who are registered as unemployed or looking for work, 88 percent have no professional qualifications. And that hasn't changed to this day!"
2241	7	"All of this resulted from the federal government's response to a request from AfD member of the Bundestag René Springer. According to statistics, the quota of refugees in the so-called benefit receipt would be up to 60 percent, depending on their nationality. In the German population, the Hartz IV rate is 5.6 percent. ""Despite all the whitewashing by the government and the established media, the massive immigration into our social systems can no longer be denied,"" sums up René Springer. All the billions in taxes that have been spent on integration measures so far have ""spent mostly ineffectively""."
2241	9	"One rightly wonders how such numbers fit together with the current plans of the traffic light government. With effect from June 1st, the Ukrainian refugees have now received Hartz IV benefits and, as expected, there are already demands to do this with all asylum seekers. Meanwhile, property checks and sanctions if someone rejects job offers or further training should be abolished without replacement! It is the complete sell-out of the German welfare state! Fewer and fewer people in regular jobs have to work longer and longer for more and more people who can't or don't want to work - and that's often why they make their way to ""Germoney"". Meanwhile, for many, the pension is no longer enough to live on!"

2242	5	The three-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers at Weissenhaus Castle in Schleswig-Holstein faced a difficult task: keeping the ranks of the Russian warriors united -- given that the results of this new US/NATO crusade were anything but than are intoxicating. Not only militarily, but also on the sanctions front, it looks as if Russia will emerge victorious, despite the “mother of all sanctions” from Washington and Brussels. There should have been a need for discussion at Weissenhaus Castle.
2242	7	The war against Russia provoked by the USA and NATO will be expensive - in every respect. The US Congress just passed a $40 billion Ukraine “bailout” package. Apparently that shouldn't be the end of the road. Experts suspect an increase to 60 to 70 billion US dollars. The federal government wants to upgrade Germany with 100 billion euros. In almost all NATO countries, an increase in the armaments budget is being discussed. Poland has already decided on the new 3 percent/GDP armament target. The increase in NATO armaments budgets this year – in US dollars – will be in the hundreds of billions.
2242	9	Gold rush mood in the armaments industry, but not very effective for the hopeless fight of the Ukrainian armed forces. Even after the NATO allies have scraped together just about everything they could find of obsolete material in the warehouses, the situation for the Ukrainian troops continues to deteriorate.
2242	11	"At the same time, uncertainty is spreading even in industry as to how the energy supply for Europe is to be secured when Brussels intensifies its self-boycott of oil and gas without even having a clue as to how and from where the necessary energy gap is to be closed. Especially since Ukraine itself has begun to close key gas pipelines. Not to mention the resulting price increases. Russians and Chinese will sit in the warmth in winter. It remains to be seen whether this will also be the case in Europe. The same applies to important industrial metals, fertilizers and grain. Here, too, the Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian products are almost irreplaceable. Berlin and Brussels, as always cynical and arrogant, are in the process of undermining not only the competitiveness of German industry but also the food supply of the European population with their ""mother of all sanctions"". Not everyone likes that in Europe."
2242	13	"Of course, the G7 meeting did not intend to turn this situation around for the better and initiate a ceasefire or even an end to the sanctions war. It was about consolidating and strengthening the war narratives. Of course, Ukraine continues to win from defeat to defeat and of course Vladimir Putin is to blame - personally - if petrol is expensive and bread is no longer available here - and not the absurdly counterproductive sanctions: ""Freeze and starve against Putin"". ."
2242	15	"As always, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba was impressive. He and the Zelensky regime as a whole are trying to capitalize on the fact that they were the ones who handed the country over to destruction on behalf of Washington. Now the ""West"" is said to be bleeding too: ""Sometimes it's cheaper to help someone else and endure a short period of deprivation than to sit at home, watch TV and do nothing, just allow the problem to eventually spread to the people own door knocks,” said Kuleba. ""Give us everything we need and we will encircle Russia and defeat in Ukraine so they never knock on your door."""
2242	17	Ukraine is bankrupt. The country is missing about 8 billion US dollars per month(!). Zelenskiy has asked the G7 countries for $50 billion to offset Ukraine's acute budget deficit. The USA, EU and NATO are not only financing the war and the fascists, but the Ukrainian state as a whole. One thing is clear: the war will not work and the 50 billion will not be enough. And this is not about “a short time” as Kuleba and the G7 want us to believe.
2243	1	Let's start in Europe with denazification
2243	3	"Given the new unprecedented Russophobia in Europe and the US, did the Ukrainian and European Nazis actually manage to gain the global recognition demonstrated in “our media”? Obviously yes! Because according to the words of the ninth Chancellor of the Fourth German Reich, Olaf Scholz, he described the mass extermination (genocide!) of Russian people in the Donbass, which the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, called with great concern, by the Ukrainian fascists and Nazis there since their putsch being practiced in 2014, simply as ""ridiculous""."
2243	5	An unbelievable insult and insult to all people and peoples of the Soviet Union/Russia, who lost more than 27 million people in the liberation of their country and the European countries from fascism and Nazism. Well aware that Ukraine's major invasion of the Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea and Russia regions will begin on February 28, 2022 in coordination with NATO, he officially sided with the Ukrainian Nazis in the Bundestag on February 27 and sharply criticized the countries showing solidarity with Russia's February 24 special military operation in Ukraine.
2243	7	As expected, the Left Party, completely ignorant of the actual political and military situation in Ukraine, condemned the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, as an aggressor and war criminal. Is it any wonder that a certain Mr. Gregor Gysi, in a politically and morally repugnant television program, informs us in an extremely competent and knowledgeable manner that, in connection with the planned arms deliveries to the Ukrainian Nazis, military secrets from the German armaments industry were by no means given to the “Russians ' may be betrayed. Who is he? Who does he represent? Who pays him? How should the layman, but still normal-thinking person, classify and process this extremely complex information about the interest of the left in a well-functioning protection of secrets in the German armaments industry?
2243	9	Has the so-called civilized world already forgotten or... already forgiven the blatant crimes of the European Nazis under the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the Soviet Union and other countries? How long will it be before we live in a colonial-Nazi Europe again? The preparations for this are in full swing. Are we really already so blind and stupid that we can't see the apparitions and events associated with them, and we can't properly assess and evaluate them?
2243	11	The constant attempt by the American establishment to equate Joseph Stalin – i.e., the USSR – with the murderous Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, and the strong financial and military support of the Nazi forces in Ukraine since the 2014 coup in Kyiv by the United States and In the end, she herself exposed her vassals as flawless Nazis. Because their strategic goal was, is and remains the annihilation of Russian civilization! If possible by a war at foreign hands. Just as it was tried unsuccessfully in the years 1941 - 1945 with the help of the German Nazis! Now, with the possibility of deploying very strong military forces and the use of modern nuclear weapons (see the US first strike strategy!), the notorious warmongers have much more diabolical instruments at their disposal for the extermination and enslavement of mankind. This murderous strategic objective is not a well-kept US and NATO secret. Nor is it primitive propaganda by the “evil Russians” against the peace-loving USA. No! On the contrary! This Nazi strategic goal is loudly published in all the ruling media of the USA and its vassals as it is intended and as it should be realized in practice.
2243	13	It is therefore no coincidence that the new temporary ally of the US and NATO, the new Nazi instrument for weakening Russia and, if possible, destroying Russian civilization is Ukraine. The USA, Great Britain, the FRG, Poland and others have worked hard for many years on the devilish instrument “Ukraine”, a lot of money has been invested in the devilish instrument “Ukraine” for weapons and other military equipment, the devilish instrument “Ukraine” has been through single-minded training of its political and military leaders has developed into a murderous monster that puts even the worst representatives of the German Nazis in the years 1941-1945 in the shade.
2244	5	"Archbishop Viganò: WHO treaty is an attack on national sovereignty and part of a ""global coup."""
2244	7	In the coming days, nations affiliated with the World Health Organization (WHO) will vote on WHO pandemic management resolutions. These resolutions transfer sovereignty over citizens' health to a supranational body funded largely by the pharmaceutical industry and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. If these resolutions are passed by a majority, in the event of a pandemic, the WHO will have sole international authority to enact all regulations, including quarantines, lockdowns, compulsory vaccinations and vaccination certificates. It should also be borne in mind that this organization enjoys immunity and therefore its members cannot be tried or convicted if they commit criminal offences. Unelected technocrats will, paradoxically, have more power than the citizens accord to their representatives through their democratic elections.
2244	9	Considering that the surrender of sovereignty is considered treason under the laws of any nation, and that parliaments must not legislate against the interests of the nation, much less violate the natural liberties and fundamental rights of the citizens they represent, I believe , it will not escape anyone that this attempt by the WHO to seize a power that actually belongs to the individual nations aims to prevent any kind of resistance to the “Agenda 2030”, which in the field of health also includes the drastic reduction of the medical and hospital services, privatization of the healthcare industry and disease prevention through vaccines.
2244	11	Pandemic treaty empowers criminal WHO over nations
2244	13	The psycho-pandemic has demonstrated the enslavement of the rulers, the political system, the media, the judiciary, the entire medical industry and even the Holy See itself to the dictates of a group of officials of a supranational organization with a blatant conflict of interest. The catastrophic side effects of the experimental mRNA serum are only now being recognized, while many rightly expect that those responsible for these decisions should be held accountable in an independent court.
2244	15	It therefore seems absurd, to say the least, to give the WHO binding decision-making authority when the greatest damage in the form of deaths and permanent damage to health has occurred during the management of the recent pandemic emergency and the vaccination campaign. Aside from the impunity it enjoys thanks to the mainstream media's silence for the crimes it has committed, the WHO also has complete autonomy of choice in how to respond to the coming emergencies apparently being planned by the pharmaceutical lobby. The ostracism of health workers who invoke the Hippocratic Oath threatens to become the norm to silence any dissenting voice.
2244	17	In this context, it is significant that the nations opposed to the new world order - such as Russia and Brazil - are aware of the very serious consequences that the ratification of these resolutions would entail and are therefore opposed to their adoption. During his tenure, President Donald Trump also sent an unmistakable signal by halting US Treasury funding for the WHO. It was one of the reasons the deep state blocked his 2020 re-election and backed a compromised and corrupt individual whose son Hunter is involved in funding American biolabs in Ukraine.
2244	19	"I therefore express my full support to the citizens - especially scientists, doctors and lawyers - who denounce this threat to the national sovereignty of the affiliated nations and call for the past events and the consequences that the decisions of the WHO for the health of the world population have to be enlightened. I call on the Heads of State or Government, who are called to comment on the ratification of these resolutions, to oppose them as they run counter to the common good and aim to carry out the global coup that the WHO and the World Economic Forum (WEF) have been trying to achieve for years under the names ""Agenda 2030"" and ""Great Reset""."
2244	21	Global health governance is one of the fundamental elements of the New World Order, as has been made clear by authoritative experts uncompromised with the system, and as such it must be rejected and opposed. The logic of control, profit and mass pathologization must be replaced by a public health policy whose ultimate goal is the health of citizens and the protection of their inalienable rights.
2244	23	Holy See must affirm rights and protect the vulnerable
2244	25	The Holy See - which has been a permanent observer at the United Nations and also at the WHO for a year - has a duty to reaffirm the right of individuals to accept or refuse health treatments, especially in the face of the concrete risk of negative effects, some of which are still unknown this experimental genetic treatment. And if Bergoglio and his cabal have so far given in to the delusions of Gates, Schwab and Soros, it is time for the Catholic Church to defend the weakest, the defenseless unborn, the children and the elderly, as well as those who have been threatened by the cynicism of businessmen and conspirators to force them to be vaccinated with a serum contaminated with aborted fetal cell lines.
2244	27	The Vatican's current conspiratorial silence, after its hasty declarations at the beginning of the pandemic and its nefarious support of Big Pharma, will be attributed to the condemnation of the Roman Sanhedrin, which has made itself an accomplice in a crime against God and men. Never in history has the hierarchy prostituted itself to secular power in such a submissive and wretched manner. Let us pray that some bishops will find the courage to distance themselves from Bergoglio's collaborative line and find the words to open the eyes of the good people who have been deceived by globalist propaganda.
2245	1	The goal is regime change in Moscow
2245	3	"In October 2014, then-US Vice President Joseph Biden boasted in a lecture at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts: ""We gave Putin a simple choice: Respect the sovereignty of Ukraine or you will grow."" Face the consequences.” By that time, the coup in Kyiv that the US had been preparing for a long time – in defiance of Ukraine’s sovereignty – had already taken place, the civil war in eastern Ukraine had begun, and US President Barack Obama was pressuring leading European politicians against Russia with tough impose sanctions. The consequences of these sanctions, according to Biden, were “a massive flight of capital from Russia, an outright freeze on foreign direct investment, the ruble at an all-time low against the dollar, and the Russian economy on the brink of recession.” It was about reaching out to Russia ruin if it does not open up to western capital interests. With Russian President Vladimir Putin resisting, the next goal was regime change in Moscow. This has been and is being worked towards since then."
2245	5	The sanctions were constantly tightened with flimsy justifications, Ukraine was armed, and with the participation of European, especially German politicians and journalists, a real smear campaign against Russia began, which in the immediate present has assumed unbelievable proportions. In March 2021, Joseph Biden said Vladimir Putin was a murderer. But this lapse, contrary to all diplomatic conventions, was not new.
2245	7	As early as 1983, Ronald Reagan declared the Soviet Union to be the “evil empire”—at that time, to the dismay of many American politicians as well—[1] with which all aggression and sanctions against the Soviet Union and subsequently against Russia and its president were ended , who opposed the claims to power of the USA, could be justified before the eyes of the world public. This has never been an issue with Western politicians and their media. Nor that the USA set the Orient on fire and that Joseph Biden, who has been working towards regime change in Russia for decades, as a senator, foreign politician and vice president, is partly responsible for almost all the conflicts and wars of the past decades.
2245	9	For years now, Russia has been surrounded by a monstrous military force. Now if Sweden and Finland join NATO, the circle will be complete. A red line drawn by Vladimir Putin after his legitimate demand for security guarantees was not met was crossed the moment the US and Britain supplied Ukraine with state-of-the-art weapons for the war in Donbass, both anti-separatist and targeted were used against civilians of the Russian-speaking minority and posed an acute threat to Russia.
2245	11	Since February 24, 2022, not only has there been a civil war in Ukraine, but Russia has invaded Ukraine. This was followed by an outcry from all those, and they are almost all of them, who have been watching the USA destroy the world peace order for decades and doing what they want. What was originally a domestic Ukrainian conflict has given rise to a proxy war between the USA and Russia, in which Ukraine is being crushed, and Germany is involved. On February 25, 2022, Secretary of State Annalena Baerbock joined Biden's destructive policies in declaring that Russia must be ruined.
2245	13	"For months we have been bombarded with stories of refugees and with pictures of crying mothers with their children in an unprecedented intensity, which arouse our sympathy. On February 26, a well-organized, sanctioned demonstration took place in Berlin with more than 100,000 participants, most of whom were honestly opposed to the war and pro-peace. Signs read ""No War!"" or ""Save Ukraine"", but also ""Stop Putin!"" and ""Murderer Putin"". A geopolitical event was becoming more and more personalized, hate was channeled - the CIA's spindoctors had done a great job. And at the same time, the German Bundestag, which provided billions in tax money for war and rearmament, was apparently unnoticed by the demonstrators."
2245	15	Now you can hear and read in the media that Putin could use biological or chemical warfare agents or even nuclear weapons, that he is unpredictable, if not insane. Rumors were circulating that Putin was seriously ill with cancer. Then again it was said that a putsch was imminent in Moscow. Lots of insinuations, maliciousness, defamation. Russian military were blamed for appalling atrocities and suspicions became facts after repeated repetitions hundreds of times.
2245	17	But the statements of the Ukrainian government and the Western media cannot be trusted. The reality is different, as we learn that in Kyiv and elsewhere alleged saboteurs were hunted down by the Ukrainian army, nationalist volunteer battalions, mercenaries and fanatical Bandera supporters[2] with the most modern weapons from the USA, Great Britain and last but not least were supplied from Germany.
2245	19	"The reports from the ""war front"" are becoming more horrific by the day. Hundreds of civilian casualties, millions have fled, destruction and suffering. But Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government statement of February 27, which was de facto a hateful declaration of war on Russia and its president, unworthy of a German chancellor, is also appalling. Which means, ""This war is Putin's war"", he ""started a war of aggression in cold blood"", the pictures from Ukraine showed ""Putin's complete lack of scruples"", one had to set limits to ""warmongers like Putin""."
2245	21	Telling the world something like this shows the inability to deal calmly with the war situation in Ukraine. Is the German chancellor parroting what the US services, the White House and NATO are telling him to do? And in the Bundestag there is an ovation for the Ukrainian ambassador, who insulted the German government for allegedly lacking support and should have been expelled long ago. It is self-denial and a lack of sovereignty that are blatantly evident here. It is not only for months that incompetent, ideologized or corrupt politicians have been making life-threatening decisions instead of serving the well-being of the population in accordance with their oath of office.
2246	3	Selenskyj is US President Biden's bailiff in Europe, to whom the local heads of government have to bow humbly. The US secret service NSA could perhaps explain in more detail why they are bucking instead of following the example of their courageous Latin American colleagues. After all, he listens to us unhindered and across the board, ex-Chancellor Merkel can testify. Blackmailing politicians is one of the lighter forms of US government crime.
2246	5	Zelenskyy satisfies the interest of the US-led military-industrial complex in a long war. After all, Ukraine currently consumes in three months
2246	7	"""the equivalent of at least two annual productions of the entire Western defense industry."""
2246	8	Scholz-HiWis polish Sankt Selenskyj's hypocrite bill
2246	10	Alastair Crooke, ex-British diplomat who brokered several Middle East ceasefire agreements, points to the overarching geopolitical background:
2246	12	“The fixation on Ukraine is basically just a cloak thrown over the realities of a disintegrating global order.
2246	14	Only since he was allowed to play the warlord by Washington's grace has the showman Zelenskyj enjoyed the intensive attention of his Western European colleagues. Before that, they and their media had dismissed him as a busybody. One year after taking office, ARD news correspondent Demian von Osten commented:
2246	16	"""He wants to be different - and makes big promises ... : 'I am ready to stop the deaths of our soldiers at any price!' ... The armistice agreed in Paris did not (but) work out. As so often before.”"
2246	18	In May 2020, Russia still accepted that the Ukrainian army waged bloody wars against its fellow citizens in Donbass and that Kyiv broke every ceasefire agreement.
2246	20	loser in every respect
2246	22	"Selenskyj was at times even on the ""shit list"" in the West, for example because he had not sufficiently effectively shielded US President Biden, who is suspected of corruption, and his son Hunter from their private rip-off in the Ukraine gas business (allegedly, father and son Biden were working lazily at the time $1.5 million a). In addition, Zelenskyj did nothing decisive against the all-powerful Ukrainian oligarchs."
2246	24	In order to secure his power, he was only too quick to go against his election promise to “end the civil war in eastern Ukraine” and go for the recapture of Donbass and Crimea. To the delight of Washington and NATO soldiers, he simply claimed that Russia was a threat to all of Western Europe. During his first visit to Chancellor Merkel in Berlin, he advocated tightening sanctions against Russia; At the time, Merkel had been smart enough to refuse.
2246	26	Facts and figures show that the presidency is a lot too big for him: until shortly before the war, 4 million Ukrainians turned their backs on their homeland, which had been drained by local oligarchs and western “investors”. That was ten percent of the total population. On July 1, 2021, against the firm will of his fellow citizens, Zelenskyi lifted the sacrosanct ban on selling state forest and farmland to private buyers. In doing so, he complied with the extortionate demand of the International Monetary Fund in return for $8 billion in war credits.
2246	28	Ukrainian oligarchs can now buy up land at the expense of many tenants from poorer sections of the population and can also act as straw men for Western real estate sharks. The US speculator George Soros is likely to be the biggest winner in the Ukraine sell-off.
2247	3	On and on, on and on, the decision-makers just can't stop executing their excessive and one-sided measures, and when their time-bound authority has expired to sharpen and prolong them. The patronage of the citizens and the disregard for their sovereignty and responsibility has no end. Whether the Senate in Berlin, the Minister of Health or the Prime Ministers of the federal states including the government under Olaf Scholz - people like the paternalism. The prime ministers and the chancellor just met, on their agenda: precautions for a more critical corona situation in autumn. It was reported that the state health ministers had unanimously decided to compile a possible catalog with mask requirements indoors and access rules such as 2G and 3G (access only for vaccinated, recovered or tested people).
2247	5	So everything as usual, it will then be towards 2023, the fourth year, after two and a half years the pandemic madness will continue. The hyperactive Minister of Health likes that, he announced on television that the preparations for the fall were in full swing and that he had ordered the appropriate vaccines for the different variants. The better equipment of the hospitals, a departure from the profit orientation of these institutions, an increase in personnel in the institutions, the interiors, a strategy with regard to treatment methods, an active normalization of social life, the obligatory proof of trust towards the population, you the legally guaranteed Giving back personal responsibility – not a word about it. Worse still, to draw conclusions from the past few years through a meaningful and relentless investigation (evaluation) - that is not on the agenda of the decision-makers. Why not?
2247	7	It is long overdue to let the citizens decide how they live, there is no longer a national or even international epidemic situation, the current variants are not as dangerous as the previous variants, as many experts point out. But politicians, intoxicated by Basta's willingness to make decisions, let the citizens wear their masks and put together packages of measures without talking about further, renewed collateral damage. The mask in public space is a symbol of power. It works, you see people walking in the park all alone with a face mask. But why doesn't anyone tell them that there is no danger in the park? Politicians like to say that health is the top priority, but health does not end with mouthguards and 1-, 2-, 3-G patronizing. With their one-way street behavior and the arrogant, presumptuous overriding of citizens by politics, health is ultimately even damaged.
2247	9	At least the virologist Klaus Stöhr, who criticizes the threatening scenario on the part of the Minister of Health, contradicts the chorus of euphoric catalog of measures decision-makers in various media. The expert does not hide the fact that new variants of the corona virus could result in a renewed increase in cases. But this would not lead to a higher number in intensive care units. Speaking of healthcare. You don't read anything anymore about the facility-related compulsory vaccination, but quite a few employees in this area do not want to and/or are unable to meet this obligation, this is how the current situation is “, unteachable people or they are blackmailed by being barred from their jobs and threatened with fines. This summer, non-vaccinated employees of health facilities who have been tested for two years and wear face masks will receive mail asking them to prove their vaccination status. Existential fear arises. Yes, those affected are not surprised by this kind of mail, they have so far resisted the regime and the coercion and perhaps already other plans, other work tasks. Hoping for the return of duty. Mandatory vaccinations are off the table (for now?) - but it's a shame not to loosen the reins on the people who care about our health.
2247	11	As a citizen, you could breathe a sigh of relief in the midst of the emerging new phase of scaremongering: after the conference with the state prime ministers, Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised that all options for action that would be needed should be available - nationwide closures of schools and But there should no longer be daycare centers.
2248	3	For years, a media alliance made up of public, state-subsidized or party-owned media has been trying to convince Germans that more illegal immigration to Germany helps or at least does no harm. So it was again with the peak of more than 190,000 asylum applications to be reported for 2021.
2248	5	As if on a secret sign, an attempt was made to downplay the number record - after all, a value as high as it had been for three years - with hardly a trace of criticism. The 42,000 follow-up applications were initially deducted from the 190,000 asylum applications filed in Germany. The high number of follow-up applications (about twice as many as usual) could point to many things, perhaps also to the increasing legal sophistication on the part of the applicants or the organizations supporting them. In any case, it shows that the issue of “asylum” is no small task for the administration.
2248	7	"Incidentally, this is also indicated by the 170,000 so-called revocation checks on asylum decisions issued, through which one wants to find out whether the reason for asylum still exists at all. The focus here: “Travel of persons entitled to protection to their country of origin”. But one should not imagine the criteria for these reviews to be too strict. An asylum lobbyist like ""Pro Asyl"" therefore immediately questions it and wants to see it abolished."
2248	9	"But with the follow-up applications, not enough was deducted from the large sum. As a precaution, the Ministry of the Interior therefore informed: 17.5 percent of the remaining asylum applications of the last year were made for ""children born in Germany under the age of one year"" - in other words for children who were born after their parents entered the country. From the 148,233 initial applications, almost 26,000 were deducted, who did not even enter Germany (but will still have to be cared for here for the time being). This argument is also carried on in unison by the press, in Die Zeit as well as in the FAZ and in the SPD's own editorial network Germany (RND) of the Madsack publishing house."
2249	3	The Bilderberg Group, whose annual secret meeting took place a few days ago in the USA, is currently acting like a war cabinet and is marketing itself to some of its own participants as a traditional, transatlantic alliance to confront the threat posed by the Eastern bloc.
2249	5	Guests include the American defense establishment, intelligence chiefs, representatives of the new NATO members Sweden and Finland, experts on China and Russia, and some people who were acting as agents in Ukraine.
2249	7	Bilderberg companies sold entire key industries to Russia. The chief Bilderbergers Kissinger and Rockefeller cultivated the most intimate, most exclusive connections to the Kremlin. Corporations from the Bilderberg environment had built up the communist Ostbock so comprehensively that one can truly speak of a global organization. )
225	3	"On Wednesday, the EU Parliament passed a draft reform of the European police agency Europol by a vote of 480 to 143 with 20 abstentions. From now on, this has the authority to process extensive and complex data sets in order to support the member states in the fight ""against serious crime and terrorism"" - or against everything that falls under ""national custom"" and national interpretation. In Germany, considering the priorities of a left-wing interior minister, one can be sure that from now on opinion criminals and dissidents criminalized as ""right-wingers"" will also fall into these categories - with the corresponding, now legalized, disenfranchisement consequences."
225	5	"This significantly increases the power of the authority based in The Hague, because Europol is supplied with huge amounts of data primarily by the national law enforcement authorities. The EU data protection officer, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, has long had a thorn in the side of the enormous flow of information that Europol receives: as early as 2020, he had reprimanded the mania for collecting there because even unsuspected persons - such as victims, witnesses or contact persons - ran the risk of being ""illegally involved"". being associated with criminal activity across the EU”. Earlier this year, Wiewiórowski ordered that information about people who could not be proven to be linked to criminal activity must be deleted after six months at the latest. On the one hand, this period enables the authority to “meet the operational requirements of the EU member states”, but on the other hand it would also “minimise the risks to the rights and freedoms of the individual”, according to Wiewiórowski. The fundamental question here is, of course, whether or what is actually “deleted” – and then in a way that cannot actually be reconstructed. There are considerable doubts about this - especially since the Europol data storage is said to include at least four petabytes with tens of billions of information parameters, according to the British ""Guardian"". No authority will part with such a laboriously hoarded ""treasure"" voluntarily - certainly not a non-transparent and only partially democratically legitimized continental police unit."
2251	1	The Great Vaccine Disaster
2251	3	"""Vaccinated people have up to six times higher infection rate than unvaccinated people, New Zealand government data shows,"" reads a recent headline from The Daily Sceptic."
2251	5	Worrying data keeps coming out of countries around the world: Those who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 are significantly more likely to contract Covid than those who have not been vaccinated. Worse still, the vaccinated are now getting sick and dying more often than the unvaccinated.
2251	7	In the UK, for example, nearly 90 per cent of Covid hospitalizations and over 90 per cent of Covid deaths were among the vaccinated in March.
2251	9	The UK data is consistent with that from other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Canada. Steve Kirsch summarized this situation in his Substack article(link is external) entitled The More You Vax, The Weaker Your Immune System Becomes.
2251	11	Kirsch's article begins with the following sentence:
2251	13	It doesn't get any crazier than this: the more often you get vaccinated, the greater your chance of catching COVID. If you get vaccinated three times, your risk of contracting COVID is three times that of an unvaccinated person.
2251	15	Kirsch then points to analyzes of government-collected data that show how dire the situation is.
2251	17	How are governments reacting to this situation? Instead of stopping the harmful vaccines, some have already announced that they will stop publishing the harmful numbers(link is external).
2251	19	One thing, of course, has become very clear: instead of stopping Covid-19, the vaccines are making the situation worse. More Covid illnesses have emerged in heavily vaccinated countries than ever before the vaccines were introduced. The examples are numerous: the UK, Germany, Israel, France, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Netherlands. The list goes on.
2251	21	Also, these highly vaccinated countries also have more Covid than less vaccinated regions. Consider this headline from Newsweek:
2251	23	COVID vaccination rates in Africa are low, but the region is avoiding the worst, leaving scientists at a loss.
2251	25	There's really nothing amazing about that. The data clearly shows what is happening: the vaccines lead to an increase in Covid, while the absence of the vaccines eventually leads to a decline in the pandemic through natural immunity.
2251	27	If we lived in a normal world and vaccines were effective, it would be the other way around. The heavily vaccinated countries would be free of Covid, while the under-vaccinated countries would bear the brunt of the pandemic.
2251	29	Authorities knew from the start that the vaccines would fail. For example, on January 29 last year—barely two months after the global vaccine offensive began—Nature magazine published an article entitled How to redesign COVID vaccines so they protect against variants. The headline contains the implicit admission that the vaccines would not protect against variants.
2251	31	And yet governments around the world have continued to lie and pump these ineffective drugs into the bodies of billions of people. In doing so, they falsely referred to a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” and maliciously attacked and even imprisoned those who refused to participate.
2251	33	Remember when Fauci said that a 60 percent vaccination rate would give us herd immunity? Today, in most Western countries, more than 80% of the adult population is vaccinated, and yet there is more Covid than ever.
2251	35	This is the sad reality of the situation: after a few months, after the initial protection has worn off, those who have been injected with the Covid vaccines are more vulnerable to contagion, serious illness and death.
2251	37	Igor Chudov, in his article titled AIDS-Like Chronic Covid is Taking Over Europe, Australia and NZ, shows how the vaccines appear to undermine their recipients' immune systems and cause AIDS -cause similar immunodeficiency. Many researchers have referred to this as VAIDS: vaccine acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
2251	39	Please consider the sheer magnitude of it all: As of April 12, more than sixty-five percent of all people on the planet have been vaccinated with these harmful substances. That's more than 5.1 billion souls.
2251	41	If the ominous trends continue, we will soon face the greatest catastrophe humankind has ever known, with billions of people whose health has been compromised or ruined.
2251	43	This disaster was brought about by ruthless vaccine advocates who injected most of the world's population with hastily concocted and improperly tested substances that failed even Phase II clinical testing. As dire as our situation is, we have yet to speak of the many people who have already been killed by these dangerous drugs.
2251	45	It is very important that vaccine manufacturers are held accountable for their actions. There is enough data to hold them responsible for the catastrophe they have brought upon humanity. This data must be released and made visible to everyone.
2251	47	As the history of vaccination has been undermined by the skyrocketing incidence of disease and the disproportionate number of vaccinated people who are ill and dying, the wild vaccination crusade has eased somewhat for the time being. Currently, pro-vaccination advocates and their media partners are using the war in Ukraine to divert public attention from their company's failure. They have been surprisingly successful with this diversionary tactic. While just a few months ago the unvaccinated were declared official hate objects, now Vladimir Putin and the Russians are the target of public anger and outrage.
2253	3	As the conflict in Ukraine rages on, Russia's FSB says it has uncovered a plot organized by Ukrainian-backed radicals to assassinate journalists, including RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan.
2253	5	A neo-Nazi group allegedly hired by Kyiv to kill TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov had several other targets, including RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, according to video footage released by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).
2253	7	"Amid the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine aimed at ""denazifying"" the country, the FSB said it had arrested a group of neo-Nazis. According to the service, the group was commissioned by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to kill the well-known Russian TV presenter and journalist Solovyov. The FSB later released a video purporting to show the suspects being arrested, searched and questioned."
2253	9	One of those arrested said the group heard about the possible murder of Sputnik news agency general director Dmitry Kiselyov, Sputnik and RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan and her husband, well-known film director and TV presenter Tigran Keosayan, as well as TV presenters Olga Skabeeva and Yevgeny Spoke Popov. The prisoner reports:
2253	11	"""There was talk about the murder of people who spread propaganda, i.e. Solovyov, Kiselyov, Skabeyeva, Popov, Keossayan and Simonian."""
2253	13	Simonyan commented on the news by saying:
2253	15	"""All men are mortal, and dying for not remaining silent, but for having the luxury of speaking the truth and protecting the fatherland in a way that you think is right and doable, is no more frightening than slowing down one dying of a terminal illness or inevitably growing old. My attitude towards this is philosophical and Christian."""
2253	17	"The arrested suspect also revealed that the SBU had ordered the group to kill Solovyov ""as soon as possible"" and that he also spoke about ""setting fire to cars with symbols in support of the army's special operations and recruiting offices""."
2253	19	The FSB stated that it had seized an explosive device, eight Molotov cocktails, six handguns, a sawed-off hunting rifle and a grenade during the searches. More than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and forged Ukrainian passports were also seized. A portrait of Adolf Hitler can also be seen in the video, which was recorded in the suspects' apartment.
2253	21	In an interview with Rossiya TV, FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov revealed some more details about the group. He said they were six Russian citizens from Moscow. All were arrested.
2253	23	"According to Bortnikov, the group was linked to the neo-Nazi organization National Socialists/White Power. According to Bortnikov, the main task of the suspects was to ""determine the location of the assassination,"" which is why, according to him, the members of the group pursued Solovyov."
2253	25	"Kyiv has denied any involvement in the alleged assassination plots, claiming the FSB's operation was ""staged""."
2253	27	Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February after Ukraine failed to implement the Minsk agreements signed in 2014 and Moscow finally recognized the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Minsk Protocol, mediated by Germany and France, was intended to give the breakaway regions a special status within the Ukrainian state.
2254	3	The prosperity in Europe - and especially in Germany - is the result of cheap energy. Germany's economic success would have been impossible without cheap energy sources, but politicians no longer want them.
2254	5	You have to say it so clearly: Without cheap energy, German prosperity would have been impossible. The core of German prosperity were industrial products such as cars, mechanical engineering, the chemical industry and others. If I had put forward the thesis a few years ago that all of this was only possible because of cheap energy, then I would have been told that that was nonsense, after all it was always said that Germany's economic success is based on the productivity of German industry.
2254	6	The key is cheap energy
2254	8	Today we see that this is real nonsense, because high productivity was only possible thanks to cheap energy. Energy costs in Europe and Germany are among the lowest in the world, which is what made European prosperity possible in the first place.
2254	10	Sure, energy hasn't been cheap for private consumers in Germany for a long time, but that's a result of the policy that has added taxes (for petrol) or all sorts of other levies (e.g. to electricity prices) to energy costs. But the costs for the energy sources themselves, especially for electricity, were also among the lowest in Germany in a global comparison.
2254	12	The reason is the Russian gas, which is firstly extracted cheaply, secondly, it is transported by pipelines, which is the cheapest way, and thirdly, it was the long-term contracts with Russian suppliers, which actually included a kind of discount, because the long-term contracts gave the Russians the necessary planning security for the development of new gas fields, which require investments in the billions.
2254	13	own mistakes
2254	15	"First, in Germany and Europe, people went on the wrong path of ""green"" energies, which showed its weaknesses in 2021 when there was no wind for the wind turbines in summer, which led to the gas crisis from October 2021, because the gas that should actually be pumped into storage for the winter, was burned in the summer to generate electricity to compensate for the lack of wind."
2254	17	Nothing has been learned from this in the EU and in Germany. Instead, the EU Commission and the federal government are calling for an accelerated expansion of alternative energies in order to solve the problem that the expansion of alternative energies has brought about. You have to come up with such ideas first!
2254	18	new problems
2254	20	As is well known, people in Brussels and Berlin now want to do without cheap Russian gas as quickly as possible. This finally and irrevocably marks the end of prosperity, because Russia finds other buyers for its gas in Asia. India and China are happy about new Russian pipelines. This makes these countries even stronger economically, while Europe then buys more expensive liquid gas on the world market and enters into a bidding war with other interested parties for supplies of liquid gas.
2254	22	The unpredictability of this bet on liquefied natural gas has just been shown by a fire at one of the largest US plants producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export. On June 8, at 11:40 a.m. local time, an explosion occurred in Quintana, about 112 kilometers south of Houston. The facility, which handles almost 20 percent of all US LNG exports, will be out of action for at least three weeks, and the world gas price immediately rose. On the Dutch exchange, where the gas is traded in the EU, the price rose by almost 13 percent the following day.
2254	24	But that's not all, because Spain, which has so far largely been able to stay out of the European gas problems because it is supplied from North Africa, is now having problems. This is particularly annoying because some politicians in the EU have hoped that Spain could at least somewhat alleviate the problems in Europe with its African gas.
2254	26	The core of the problem is the territory of Western Sahara, which Morocco and Algeria are fighting over. Spain has so far supported Algeria on the issue, but changed course a few days ago and sided with Morocco.
2255	3	While the world's division into sovereign states and colonies is not as clear-cut as some might think, President Putin's observation is a highly accurate, if oversimplified, way of understanding the global systemic transition to multipolarity. Countries will either remain colonies of the US-led West voluntarily or follow the path of China, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Venezuela and others to bolster their sovereignty.
2255	5	President Putin shared some important lessons about state sovereignty late last week at a meeting with young entrepreneurs ahead of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). In his words: “There is no in-between, no intermediate state: either a country is sovereign or it is a colony, no matter what the colonies are called. The Russian leader explained that there are at least four forms of sovereignty: military-political, economic, technological and social. On the last point, he added: “I'm talking about society's ability to come together to solve national challenges, respecting history, culture, language and all ethnic groups that share a single territory. This consolidation of society is one of the basic requirements for growth. Without consolidation, things will fall apart.”
2255	7	The global systemic transition to multipolarity has accelerated in an unprecedented manner following the launch of the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine and the enactment of counterproductive anti-Russian sanctions by the US-led West in response. America has successfully reaffirmed its waning unipolar hegemony over Europe, forcing its vassal states to inflict massive damage on their own economies by complying with its anti-Russian demands. None of these states, as well as the non-Western states such as Japan and Singapore, which also followed suit, can be called sovereign. On the contrary, they embody the postmodern colonies that President Putin described in the speech that will now be explained.
2255	9	"The intention of their leaderships to improve their military capabilities is nothing more than an undeclared submission to their American overlord's plans to use their people as cannon fodder in the proxy wars they are waging throughout the Global South, particularly in (West) Africa, intended to provoke throughout the New Cold War. They have neither political nor economic sovereignty after submitting to US anti-Russian sanctions, while their technological competitiveness will be eroded the longer they remain American vassal states. As for their social sovereignty, with the exception of Japan and Singapore, these puppet states have no respect whatsoever for traditional values, which they consider ""racist"". This has led to numerous social unrests over the past decade."
2255	11	"In contrast, Russia's military sovereignty is well known, especially after the successful development of hypersonic missiles. Politically, President Putin has made it clear that his country will never compromise on issues of national interest to please someone else. The economic and technological sovereignty of his civilized state is solid, but can still be expanded, which he is also actively working on. When it comes to social sovereignty, Russia is a world leader in showing how to respect traditional values ​​in a contemporary context. President Putin's ""populist statism"" and ""sound/moderate/reasonable conservatism"" together can be described as an unofficial ideology that other countries can implement in their own way."
2255	13	"Of these four forms of sovereignty, the social dimension is arguably the most important, without which a country will inevitably fall apart, just as the Russian leader warned. Therein lies the meaning of what may be termed ""democratic security,"" which refers to tactics and strategies against hybrid warfare. They are tailor-made according to the country in which they are practiced and according to the specific context, but all these approaches aim to consolidate the social solidarity on which prosperous and secure states are built, without provoking the colorful revolutions much more easily are. States can only achieve military-political, economic and technological sovereignty if their societies are stable and comprehensively protected against the threats of hybrid wars."
2255	15	President Putin's insight is of immense importance for the Global South, especially since these countries are likely to become the scene of countless proxy wars in the course of the New Cold War. Although some of them, under pressure from the US and the West, voted against Russia at the UN, virtually none of them have imposed sanctions on Russia, showing that they are all interested in retaining at least some measure of sovereignty. Countries like Ethiopia and India that did not vote against Russia are now the target of various pressure campaigns, despite holding up impressively well and maintaining their principled neutrality on the Ukraine conflict. This is because their people support their government's stance and their societies remain largely united despite certain fault lines.
2255	17	"Each part of the world will have its own leaders who will show everyone else the best way to strengthen their sovereignty in the four dimensions that President Putin outlined in his speech. Arranged by region, these are: China in East Asia; Vietnam in Southeast Asia; India in South Asia; Iran, Israel and Turkey in Western Asia; Ethiopia and South Africa in Africa; Hungary and Serbia in Europe; and Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela in Latin America. The means with which they practice ""democratic security"" differ due to their particular social situation, but they all strive to strengthen their social solidarity and thus their sovereignty. However, they are all linked in one way or another to the Western model of globalization, which in turn limits their sovereignty."
2255	19	"Russia has never fully participated in this system, so it is not too affected by the economic and financial consequences of US-led Western sanctions. This means that the country is comparatively much more sovereign than most, although it would be inaccurate to refer to its partners, who are more closely involved in this model, as ""colonies"". India, for example, is striving to become a world power despite being centrally positioned in the Western-oriented model of globalization. This observation shows that appropriate investment and trade policies can mitigate the neocolonial effects of participating in this system. Finally, China is supremely sovereign, although it also benefits greatly from this system, having shown the world how it can beat the US in its own globalization game."
2256	3	The hawks of the Heritage Foundation, one of the main US neocon think tanks, have been harsh and critical of US military aid to Ukraine. They believe that this is contrary to US interests.
2256	5	On the eve of the US House of Representatives vote on a military aid package for Ukraine, senior director of US think tank Heritage Action (a sister organization of the Heritage Foundation) Jessica Anderson said:
2256	7	"""The proposed aid package for Ukraine takes away money for the most urgent needs of the American people and recklessly sends our taxpayer dollars to an irresponsible foreign state."""
2256	9	Sanctions are not working, Russia is on the rise and the western media is changing tone
2256	11	"Recalling that just two months ago Congress approved a $13 billion aid package, Heritage Action noted that ""the Ukraine aid package puts America last,"" playing on the contrast to the slogan "" America First""."
2256	13	Despite the fact that the $40 billion military aid package to Ukraine was nevertheless approved by the US Congress, the critical stance of Heritage Action – led by neocon conservatives with a rich past as US hawks – is a testament to a looming change in the the attitude of US elites to events in Ukraine.
2256	15	At the time, the Heritage Foundation supported the US and its allies' invasion of Iraq and has never changed its stance since, despite the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in Iraq.
2256	17	"Heritage Action has also been a constant supporter of the US troop presence in Afghanistan, coining reports with headlines such as ""Afghan Review Shows Troop Increase Is Working"" and ""Maintain the Momentum in Afghanistan""."
2256	19	"But the heritage neocons have a very different take on military aid to Ukraine. ""Congress's approval last week of an excessive and rushed aid package for Ukraine has shown how distant our politicians are from their citizens and our problems,"" Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, told the New York Times. The Heritage Foundation's pragmatic stance reflects a profound shift in sentiment among US elites. Thomas Graham, one of the leading US experts on Russia and Vice President of Kissinger Associates, has already written a number of articles calling for a compromise with Russia and for consideration of its interests. Graham believes a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict is still possible after the start of Special Operation Z."
2256	20	Narrative change: In the US media, opinion on the possible outcome of the Ukraine war is changing
2256	22	"Speaking to Russia's RBC news agency, Graham recalled that even before hostilities erupted in Ukraine, he and his colleagues had proposed a formula that would ""meet the security needs of Russia, Ukraine, NATO countries and the United States."" could"". Among other things, it proposed a moratorium on NATO enlargement for an extended period, the initiation of a series of serious negotiations to resolve deadlocked conflicts in Europe, and the modernization of the 1975 Helsinki Accords."
2256	24	"According to Graham, it could have taken several years to reach an agreement. “At least the USSR and the West were able to negotiate the Helsinki Accords during the Cold War in 1975, and it took three years. I don't understand why we can't repeat this experience now,"" he stressed, noting that after the start of the military operation, such negotiations ""could be much tougher because trust between Western capitals and Moscow is destroyed."" Graham is by no means a friend of Russia. In the late 1980s, he wrote the article A World Without Russia, in which he predicted the rise to power in the Russian Federation of a tough and pragmatic leader who would try to restore his country to great power status, but whose plans failed, causing the country will slip into the ranks of the Third World and possibly disintegrate. ""We should think seriously and systematically about the possibility of a world without Russia,"" he said at the time."
2256	26	"Graham's prediction of Russia's disintegration has not come true, but that is not why he and his think-tank colleagues have stopped ""seriously and systematically thinking about the possibility of a world without Russia."" They are merely proposing another way to achieve this goal, namely to bring an end to the offensive of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine and drag our country into a quagmire of protracted diplomatic negotiations, during which the Ukrainian armed forces will have the opportunity restore and improve their fighting ability."
2256	28	Henry Kissinger, Graham's current boss, presented exactly this view of things at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could change the world to the detriment of Western countries. “The parties must be drawn into peace talks within the next two months. Otherwise, we will be faced with a situation where Russia could sever ties with Europe entirely and seek a lasting alliance elsewhere. That would set us back decades. We have an obligation to seek long-term peace,” the veteran of US diplomacy said.
2256	30	"In the words of Kissinger, the West should stop trying to inflict ""a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine"" because doing so would have disastrous consequences for the long-term stability of the European continent. In particular, he mentioned that Russia has been an integral part of Europe for over 400 years and a guarantor of the European balance of power. Therefore, Russia should not be “pushed into a permanent alliance with China”. It is noteworthy that Kissinger and his deputy did not say a word about the need to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine. Without a solution to this problem, however, there will be no peace in Europe."
2256	31	The US is heading for failure in Ukraine with a $40 billion plan
2256	33	"The standpoint of Kissinger and his team is currently not a general consensus in the collective West. But the “attacks” on the Kiev regime are increasing in the Western press. For example, the Washington Post wrote in an editorial that Ukrainian Russophobia will not end well. ""Literary nationalism, like other forms of cultural censorship, breeds historical ignorance, stifles critical thinking, and impedes international understanding,"" says the newspaper, which is the mouthpiece of liberal America. The editorial condemned ""attempts by [Ukrainian] ultranationalists to erase Alexander Pushkin from the historical memory and cultural life of Ukraine."" The more successful the offensive of Russia and the allied Donbass republics in Ukraine develops, the louder the voices of clever analysts will be heard in the western world calling for compromises and negotiations with Russia."
2259	3	What's next, please? Wearing a mask during sex? This government, which shuns new elections like the devil shuns holy water, is not only incompetent, as the majority of Austrians seem to think, but above all embarrassing.
2259	5	The helpless and false, because there is hardly any evidence-based corona fight policy by Nehammer & Co. is increasingly becoming a shrill endurance struggle that could ultimately do more harm than good to the people. Because if everything is organized like the introduction of mandatory vaccinations, which - as we are now hearing - cannot be tackled so quickly from a technical point of view, it is also to be feared that the effects of the forced needle prick were not really thought through in advance.
2259	6	Finally call off the coercive measures
226	3	The key to understanding the future often lies in the not-too-distant past: the failure of the vaccination campaign against polio in Africa can be seen as a cautionary tale against the all too blind belief in the “success” of the corona vaccinations. In the end, the blind trust of the WHO, health authorities and Big Pharma proved to be devastating: instead of being eradicated, polio is now really on the rise.
226	5	Shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the polio virus in Africa to be eradicated in August 2020, the UN reported a series of new polio cases in Sudan - which, however, were only triggered by the vaccinations (!). As a result, the UN had to admit that this type of virus was “widespread”. There were other cases in Ethiopia, the Central African Republic and Chad. As of October 2020, at least 260 cases of such “vaccine polio” have been reported in 15 African countries – which may be just the tiny tip of the iceberg.
226	6	Vaccination campaign stopped by Corona
226	8	The head of the vaccination program for sub-Saharan Africa explained the causes: “It is a polio virus that mutated from the oral vaccination with the weakened pathogen type two and came to Chad from Nigeria. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the distance rules, we had to stop all our activities related to the vaccination campaign. In this way, the virus was able to spread in Chad and as far as Sudan.” In August 2021, a polio outbreak was also reported in Uganda, which in turn showed genetic similarities to the virus variant detected in Sudan. To date, more and more comparable cases are becoming known across sub-Saharan Africa.
226	9	False confidence and trivializations
226	11	"In Africa, a live vaccine was used that is cheap, heat-resistant and easy to administer. In the end, this not only proved unsuitable for eradicating polio on the continent, but even led to its spread. Most instructive and revealing here is the fact that these were allegedly well-tested, risk-free and ""safe"" vaccines - mind you not even experimental mRNA vaccines - which in the end turned out to be not only counterproductive but life-threatening."
226	12	Cheap vaccines and undertested
226	14	"Today it is the same health authorities, pharmaceutical and WHO representatives who emphasize the safety and lack of alternatives to Covid vaccines worldwide - although much less is known about their mechanisms of action and possible long-term damage than is the case with the modified polio vaccine pathogens. What is to be thought of the reliability of the forecasts of this vaccination cartel can thus - once again - be impressively ""marveled at"" on the black continent. It doesn't seem to bother the mainstream media; maybe because they are only Africans? That would be another case of attention racism."
2260	1	"""NATO is not aggressive"": Scholz questions Russia's NATO security concerns"
2260	3	According to his own statements, Chancellor Olaf Scholz does not want to take Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements about the aggressive actions of the Atlantic Alliance in the past seriously and regards the associated security concerns on the Russian side towards the NATO states as a debate about history.
2260	4	"“To be clear: NATO is not aggressive, there is no reason to be afraid; the EU is not aggressive, there is no reason to be afraid,"" Scholz said in English during a question and answer session at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. But Vladimir Putin takes a different view. ""When I tell him that, he always uses the argument from the former Yugoslavia and says that NATO behaved aggressively there and harmed people who did nothing."""
2260	5	"""I answer that we tried to prevent a genocide and that he should understand that the people of the western Balkans really want to become members of the EU, so in the end they see it differently,"" Scholz said."
2260	7	So there are real differences of opinion. “Then he (President Vladimir Putin – editor's note) comes and claims that there is something like genocide in Donbass, which is really ridiculous, to put it bluntly. But that is his story.” The Chancellor stressed that it was very important to pay more attention to what others were saying. But such arguments have their limits:
2260	8	"""If we were to take it literally, it wouldn't make us very optimistic about the future. And I refuse to do that. I think it's just a discussion of history. And I answer (Putin – editor's note) (...) that we cannot change the borders, that we have to accept the integrity and sovereignty of the countries that we have in Europe.”"
2261	3	Why life is in danger in Franconia. Actually everywhere in Germany. And why, strictly speaking, is a good thing.
2261	5	"The sun is currently shining over Germany, and thus also over Nuremberg and its city administration. According to the news portal North Bavaria, it announces ""temperatures above 30 degrees"" and prepares the residents for the worst: ""Summer heat reaches Franconia: City of Nuremberg warns of 'acute danger to life'."""
2261	7	As is well known, the acute differs from the non-acute danger to life in that one dies immediately, not later like everyone else. The portal further reports:
2261	9	"“As part of a press release from the city, the Nuremberg Health Department pointed out that temperatures that could endanger health are expected to be reached as early as this week. ""Even at 26 degrees Celsius, the body reacts with increased sweating and circulatory disorders,"" says the message from the town hall."
2261	11	Anyone who doesn't immediately leave Nuremberg's death zone feet first will at least know where the accumulation of fluid in the neck and armpits is coming from, thanks to the city's warning message. And hopefully one or the other Franconian will at least rebook their vacation from Hurghada to Hammerfest.
2261	13	"""There will be no return to normality,"" said a daily news commentator some time ago. And he was right, as only an ARD media representative can be right. In the past, when people thought of Ingmar Bergman films when they heard the word “young woman from Sweden”, warmth in summer was not considered a precursor to the apocalypse, but a good prerequisite for spending the day at the lake. Anyone who had to work on 30-degree days fretted, but at least got an ice cream in between and a cold beer in the evening."
2261	15	It used to be like that. That's never coming back. Media representatives will probably soon prove that people simply remember things incorrectly.
2261	17	"The Thunberg sentence ""I want you to panic"" is one of the most successful instructions ever, at least in a large part of the media - and recently also in the city administration. Anyone who simply interprets weather as weather is guaranteed to live outside of these two realms. And probably for far too long. Because we have to go back a long way to remember messages like ""nice summer weather for the next few days"". In any case, last year the Hessische Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) headlined around the same time, on June 12: ""Heat wave is rolling towards Germany - tropical temperatures also expected at night"". Because: ""The temperatures in northern Germany are around 20 degrees on Sunday and the temperatures are expected to rise again from Monday, a real heat wave is rolling towards Germany."""
2261	19	"The portal Der Westen also reported in 2021: ""Weather in NRW: Attention! Unbearable tropical heat approaching”. Incidentally, waves are constantly rolling in, a storm is marching on or in, and when it gets cold in winter - that also happens - then it is a question of a ""Russian whip"" (Image). A stylistic resemblance to frontline reports from very early on can hardly be overlooked. Speaking of the Russian whip: “New, crazy prognosis: cold shock in December?” The Berlin Kurier shocked its readers in winter 2021."
2261	21	"Many weather apps actually warn of ""extreme cold"" as soon as the temperatures fall below minus five degrees. If summer heat and winter cold are not rolling over Germany, torrential rain and/or monster hurricanes will sweep over the country in such a way that the authorities should not only warn their own citizens, but also all tourists and migrants: ""Do not enter, danger to life"". And that at least 360 days a year."
2261	23	"""When will it really be summer again?"", Rudi Carrell once sang irresponsibly, ""a summer like it used to be?"" With a lido, sunbathing lawn, cool drink and general joy about temperatures above 25 degrees, even among editors and city administrators ? Stupid question: not anymore. And autumn, so that's clear, is no longer the time for colorful leaves, but for the next killer virus."
2261	25	From minus 10 degrees in winter, caused by jet stream changes at the North Pole, as a climate expert will explain on television, the points of the trains freeze again, in whose cars the climate fails from 26 degrees in summer.
2261	27	At least there.
2261	29	Well, constant hysteria is not for everyone. Some claim they can't take the panic blast any longer. In doing so, they overlook a much more important insight that reaches far, far beyond the Franconian death zone: this people is guaranteed not to march to Stalingrad again. Not to Tobruk either. Even with an electric tiger.
2261	31	Doesn't that count?
2262	3	"With Nancy Faeser (SPD) in the Ministry of the Interior and Anne Spiegel (Greens) in the Ministry of Family Affairs, two ministers are responsible for these issues, who leave no doubt that for them exclusively ideological approaches are in the foreground. Instead of looking at the actual problems and developing solutions, people deal with queer officers or ""right-wing extremism"" as the supposedly biggest problem."
2262	5	Not only do the 20,000 girls threatened by genital mutilation show where our country is headed. Because one can neither speak of individual cases here, nor can such a development simply be wiped away. On the contrary, Germany finds itself in a situation in which our cultural and liberal values ​​are becoming less and less important. Archaic and inhuman structures are gaining ground, while political decision-makers not only disregard this fact, but also applaud themselves for their fatal migration policy.
2262	7	Germany does not need more migration, but a freeze on immigration.
2262	9	Anyone who thinks they can make archaic traditions part of everyday life in Germany must leave our country. Anyone who commits serious bodily harm in the form of genital mutilation must be punished with the full severity of the law. This is the way to deal with all those who undermine our value system and threaten our freedom and equality.
2262	11	It's finally enough: Ms. Faeser, resign!
2262	13	Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD), who was completely unknown until her left-wing extremism scandal, has already lost confidence in her own security authorities.
2262	15	In a lonely push, Faeser pushed ahead with the plan to form a “coalition of the willing” within the EU. EU states should agree to accept more migrants.
2262	17	Only France, however, sided with Germany, while 16 EU states not only refuse to take in more migrants, but are also demanding the erection of fences and walls at the EU's external borders. Another proof of the abstruse special way that Germany is trying to go again. This is also the opinion of those who actually head Faeser as Minister of the Interior.
2262	19	In an internal paper, the company's own security authorities warn of the catastrophic effects of Faeser's policy.
2262	21	"According to the Joint Analysis and Strategy Center for Illegal Migration, both the ominous ""coalition of the willing"" and the announcement that entire groups of so-called refugees would be taken directly from the Mediterranean into the EU would increase the pressure to migrate drastically. What is particularly piquant is that this group of experts is subordinate to the Chancellery, which is also run by the SPD."
2263	3	Moscow (dpo) - NATO is struggling with new members in strategic positions while Russia's economic and military power is in freefall. Since the war of aggression against Ukraine, which was completely disastrous for Russia in every respect, more and more observers are asking the only obvious question: Is Russia's President Vladimir Putin really an agent of the West?
2263	5	Many indications of this are well known: Nobody has strengthened NATO, which is hostile to Russia, like Putin in recent years. It is thanks to him alone that Sweden and Finland give up their decades of neutrality and join the alliance. Georgia and Moldova could follow. Here the question arises:
2263	7	As supreme leader, Putin is also responsible for the constant strategic failures of his army and thus for gigantic losses in personnel and material. More and more observers are asking themselves: does Russia even want to win the war? Or is it sabotage from the very top?
2263	9	In addition, Putin has been supplying Europe and its allies with cheap gas and oil for years. Even in times of Western sanctions, raw materials flow. Is this how a person who wants to harm the West behaves?
2263	11	So is Vladimir an agent of a rival secret service? The CIA? The Mossad? The Illuminati? Or even the BND? The latter in particular sounds plausible. Because: why does Putin speak fluent German, the language of a NATO country?
2263	13	A look into the past is worthwhile here. Putin is said to have stayed in Dresden between 1985 and 1990 - at that time apparently still on the side of the KGB or the Stasi:
2263	15	Was this when the BND contacted him? Is Putin a double agent? Is former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder (Gazprom) the contact person from whom Putin receives his instructions?
2263	17	"Did Schröder call Putin a ""flawless democrat"" so that nobody would become suspicious? Was it possible that the former Chancellor personally gave Putin the order to attack Ukraine on February 24, 2022? Why is there a pyramid on Putin's Stasi ID card? We only ask questions. Are we just asking questions?"
2263	19	But there are not only contacts to the FRG. The Postillon has several discriminatory images that are said to show Putin at meetings with US Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump. So did he get his instructions directly from the highest level?
2263	21	"Putin seems to be at least fluent in English - as evidenced by a video in which he sings about a mysterious ""Blueberry Hill"" on which he found his ""thrill"":"
2263	23	"Is the ""blueberries"" a code for agent activities in the service of the West? After all, blue is the color of NATO."
2263	25	"Let's stick to English: could it be a coincidence that the name ""Putin"" has an English meaning? ""put in"" means something like ""placed"" or even ""smuggled in"". Was Putin smuggled into Russia?"
2263	27	This is also supported by his recently changed appearance. Everyone knows that agents have to undergo various cosmetic surgeries in order to remain undetected during their mission. But especially in old age, operated faces get more and more out of joint.
2263	29	This may also be the reason why Putin, after years of relatively inconspicuous action, is now taking increasingly daring actions against Russia. He wants to do as much damage as possible before his true colors are revealed.
2265	3	"In an interview with Britain's BBC, the channel's correspondent put a number of critical questions to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The interview increasingly developed into a dispute, in which the Foreign Minister finally took on the role of critical questioner himself. This is reported by the magazine ""RT DE""."
2265	5	"RT DE continues: ""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov granted the British state broadcaster BBC an interview on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. The questions were asked by BBC correspondent Steve Rosenberg, who has also asked Russian President Vladimir Putin several times in recent years at his annual press conference."
2265	7	In contrast to the situation in Western countries, where Russian journalists are not allowed to talk to top politicians, Rosenberg Lavrov was allowed to ask critical questions even in the current situation of a de facto proxy war between Russia and Great Britain. Thus, the journalist took the view that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was unjustified and unprovoked and now causing unnecessary casualties for Russia and the civilian population in Donbass.
2265	9	The interview then quickly developed into a dispute, in which the Russian Foreign Minister himself took on the role of critical questioner on several occasions. He accused the BBC and other Western media such as the German ARD of reporting on the events in the Ukraine conflict selectively and untruthfully and of not taking into account the history of the Russian military operation in Ukraine.
2265	11	"Western countries have forgotten everything that preceded the start of the military operation in Ukraine on February 24, blaming Moscow alone for starting the fighting. This is another example of ""Cancel Culture""."
2265	13	"The journalist then raised the question of whether the Russian authorities were planning an invasion of other countries as well. Rosenberg was referring to the statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Tsar Peter the Great did not ""invade"" Swedish territory during the Great Northern War, but that he merely ""returned"" his own territories to Russia. ""How many and which areas will you give back?"" asked the journalist."
2265	15	"The minister then said that Putin had ""already said everything"" and that there was nothing to add."
2265	17	"""I'll tell you again: they are trying to forget everything that preceded this event. They deny, deny, do not want to hear what preceded February 24, which was the vote in Crimea. They are not satisfied with that that we are very patient. But when our patience 'breaks', we react to the rudeness and humiliation of the Russian people, like in the coup [in Ukraine] in February 2014,"" Lavrov said."
2265	19	"When the correspondent asked Lavrov about the fate of the British fighters who were captured during the fighting and sentenced to death as mercenaries in the Donetsk People's Republic, Lavrov replied that this question should be addressed to the Donetsk People's Republic. ""In the eyes of the West, Russia is responsible for the fate of these people,"" Rosenberg countered, but Lavrov interrupted him:"
2265	21	I'm not at all interested in who is responsible for this in the 'eyes of the west'. I'm only interested in international law, according to which mercenaries are not combatants. So it doesn't matter how you see it.
2265	23	When Rosenberg protested that the two men were not mercenaries but had served in the Ukrainian military, Lavrov argued that this was a matter for the court - a court as legitimate and independent as the British courts.
2265	25	British nationals Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were among a trio of foreign fighters convicted as mercenaries by the Donetsk Supreme Court last week. They were sentenced to death along with Moroccan citizen Ibrahim Saadun.
2266	3	In the slipstream of the current armed conflict in Ukraine, there is also vigorous speculation about the future of the country. For example, Poland recently promoted simulation games via a formal federation of both countries (which for Poland would amount to a recovery of the former eastern Polish territories in western Ukraine). Moscow is not fundamentally opposed to such considerations and takes into account the considerable potential for conflict between Polish and Ukrainian nationalists.
2266	5	"Now the Russian side has fueled speculation about the future of Ukraine. The Russian ex-president Medvedev, currently chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, summarily questioned the continued existence of an independent Ukraine on Telegram. Medvedev wrote that he had read that Ukraine wanted to conclude contracts for the supply of US liquefied gas for two years, adding: ""Just one question: who said that in two years Ukraine would still exist on the world map will?"""
2266	7	"The Kremlin did not directly comment on Medvedev's statements. When asked by journalists, spokesman Dmitry Peskov simply said: ""We know that Ukraine has major problems."" The country continues to refuse to ""bridle nationalist units"" in its own ranks, said Peskov. ""And therefore, of course, this doesn't bode well for Ukraine."""
227	3	"""Hydrogen is highly questionable as a climate-friendly energy source."" With these words, the energy policy spokesman for the AfD parliamentary group, Dr. Uwe Hellstern of the assertion by FDP parliamentary group leader Hans-Ulrich Rülke. ""The new study 'Atmospheric implications of increased Hydrogen use' reveals an unexpected hydrogen problem: While not a greenhouse gas, it can act as one, powerfully 'boosting' other greenhouse gases when it enters the Earth's atmosphere. The authors make the greenhouse effect of hydrogen dependent on how much escapes into the atmosphere during use. If this is a higher proportion, as is the case with methane, the hydrogen can even intensify climate change.”"
227	5	After the AfD faction woke them up, the state government is working hard to fill the gaps in the hydrogen story, Hellstern believes. “Unfortunately, as just shown, new gaps keep opening up. It is now admitted that the key cost factor is the life of the iridium or platinum catalysts used. In practice, however, it is important to be able to easily regenerate or replace them. In particular, the iridium trioxide formed in the deactivated catalyst is highly toxic. These problems, which were previously ignored, are now being tackled with a lot of research money, but they are far from being solved.”
2271	1	Russian icebreakers – or: How the West (also) shoots itself in the foot in the Arctic
2271	3	"""When the woman jumps off the wagon,"
2271	4	"'s draft horse sings with relief."""
2271	6	This Russian phrase is one of the most politically incorrect imaginable. But it describes all the better the sudden decision by a group of seven western countries in the Arctic Council to meet in future without Russia, without Russia, which incidentally currently chairs the organization. In 2023, the role of coordinator will be transferred to Norway - of course only if there is still something to coordinate. Because on the home page of the Council's website it says:
2271	8	"""The Arctic Council is suspending all official meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies until further notice."""
2271	10	It looks as if the organization is about to end. Russia will have to take full control of the Arctic if its partners don't come to their senses. The Russian Ambassador to the USA Anatoly Antonov patiently tried to persuade the authors of the strange demarche:
2271	12	"""In the face of such a step, not only Russia, as chairman of the Council, can but be concerned - but the entire international community, which is interested in further sustainable development of the region."""
2271	14	He called these events - prompted by Russia's special military operation in Ukraine - an improper politicization and recalled that decisions by the Arctic Council without Russia's participation are illegitimate as they violate the principle of consensus laid down in the policy documents of that organization . This means that no decision at all can be made without Moscow's formal approval. And whoever met it and accepted it for implementation is consequently a separatist.
2271	16	However, the fact that there are several coup plotters in the Arctic Council and that Russia stands alone against them does not give them any more rights. And the people concerned understand this very well - you can hear it in the sweet chanting and murmuring of the Western diplomats:
2271	18	"""We intend to continue our activities in the Arctic Council, on a limited basis, on projects that do not envisage Russian involvement. These projects ... are an important part of our responsibility to the people of the Arctic, including indigenous peoples."""
2271	20	And they try to put out some hay for the donkeys – just in case:
2271	22	"""We believe the Arctic Council remains valuable for cooperation in the region and we reiterate our support for this forum and its activities."""
2272	3	Are you looking forward to a utopia where you eat bugs and own nothing, where a chip in your body is linked to a social credit system that tells a global government everything it needs to know about you?
2272	5	For several months, the Dutch party Forum for Democracy (FvD) has been producing videos in English on the main issues threatening our world. In the conservative party's latest video, politician Simone Kerseboom pokes fun at the subversive World Economic Forum (WEF). The politician exposes the dangerous and anti-freedom agenda of the globalists who attended their annual meeting in Davos last May:
2272	7	The World Economic Forum, the premier gathering of the world elite, took place in Davos at the end of May after two years of hiatus thanks to Covid.
2272	9	The usual suspects, from Bill Gates down, were all there. The agenda featured panel discussions on all sorts of topics, including freedom of the press, “misinformation”, transhumanism, globalization, the energy transition and the food crisis.
2272	11	A place where world leaders debate plans to restrict free speech and loudly predict the loss of wealth and well-being for ordinary people. You will own nothing and you will be happy.
2272	13	As leaders from around the world enjoyed their champagne and steaks, they made plans to ensure that you, the ordinary citizens of the world, would eat Bug burgers and tofu dishes for the rest of your life. All well said. All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.
2272	15	And between promoting impoverishment and total surveillance of their populations in the name of the major religions of public health and combating climate change, the same government leaders who are meant to represent you and me. We dream of an increasingly globalized world without borders and nation states.
2272	17	Ministers from EU countries fantasize about an EU army. After all, a flag worn on the sleeve ensures differences.
2272	19	And then the CEOs of the major social platforms talked about how they control and censor information and decide for you what information is authoritative and what isn't.
2272	21	You no longer have to worry about the problematic facts presented by your government or the mainstream media about Covid, the climate or immigration; YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are in control.
2272	23	And what do you think of the transhumanist agenda, its attempts to normalize a world in which we are all implanted with chips, sold under the guise of efficiency, progress and improving the human condition, but which favors technology over humanity uplifts and at the same time promotes the ultimately vain society?
2272	25	I don't know about you, but I still prefer to be able to think for myself.
2272	27	Davos is not a forum at all and certainly not a world forum. But a sectarian, ideological and militant western club. Klaus Schwab boasts that his foreign countries are invading the governments of many countries. After all, politicians like Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau were the young leaders of the World Economic Forum. The Dutch Prime Minister proudly wears his World Economic Forum to work every day.
2272	29	Schwab was basically implying that he controls them. And that is a big problem for politicians and pro-democracy actors in the Netherlands trying to fight this globalist agenda. As the World Economic Forum blurs the lines between private and public organizations, it may be a private organization. But the World Economic Forum is deeply embedded in the public services of countries around the world.
2272	31	Requests by parliamentarians from their own governments for access to documents recording exchanges between public officials and the World Economic Forum must first be approved by the World Economic Forum.
2272	33	This undermines the democratic control of parliaments and is an affront to political transparency. And as far as it still exists: did you vote for this club of billionaires, world politicians and activists?
2273	3	As a climate and energy realist, my heart dreams for the day when the public realizes that climate change will not spell the end of the world as we know it, or even a long-term net loss to human civilization. So does the data and the best scientific evidence, despite the claims of corporate media, alarmist activists, corporate bosses and politicians who profit from money and power by promoting the fairy tale of the end of the world through climate change. Unfortunately, the public rarely hears this truth.
2273	5	"A few notable examples of the unalarming facts about climate change gaining widespread acceptance in recent years include the publication of several best-selling books by prominent liberals who advocate what they believe to be sensible climate policies: Michael Shellenberger's ""Apocalypse Never"" , Steven Koonin's ""Unsettled"" and Bjorn Lomborg's ""False Alarm"". Heartland's book Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students, which is strictly about climate science and not politics, has also sold well on Amazon. However, despite the success of these publications with the literary and reading public, I would be surprised if these books combined sold more than a million copies in the United States, which has a population of more than 330 million people, or a few million copies among the eight billion people worldwide. Sadly, I suspect that in the United States more people are exposed to false climate alert stories in the mainstream media every day than have been reached by all of these books in the two years since the first book was published."
2273	7	But hope dies last, and climate realists press on, trying to breach the nearly impregnable wall of climate change disinformation that has been erected by the powerful corporations, media, and political elites. Every now and then, the realists hit a bull's eye that makes the arguments of the climate and energy realists so compelling that even the mainstream media and elite journals take notice. Such was the case recently when the New York Times Magazine (NYTM) published an interview with eminent scientist Vaclav Smil, Ph.D., in which he published his book How the World Really Works: The Science Behind How We Got Here and Where We're Going. (More mainstream yet elitist than the NYTM does it get.) Another direct realist blow to the climate alarm edifice came with the publication of Ted Nordhaus's article “Russia's War Is the End of Climate Policy as We Know It” in Foreign magazine Affairs.
2273	9	Both Smil and Nordhaus are far more convinced than I am that human activities are causing potentially dangerous climate change. While I disagree to some extent with their assessment of the dangers of climate change, their “realpolitik” analyzes of the impracticability of the net-zero energy transition in the 2030-2050 timeframe are compelling and accurate.
2273	11	Despite the constant flattery of the NYTM interviewer, who basically asked the same question over and over again, prompting Smil to admit that climate change is such a looming catastrophe that world leaders need to forcibly decarbonize our energy systems almost immediately, refused Smil, take the bait. His consistent response, based on his assessment of the world's energy and material needs to reach net zero in the short term, was that that goal is physically and politically impossible. Smil also made it clear that the threat of climate change does not justify such a dramatic forced switch.
2273	13	"For Smil, the four pillars of modern civilization are cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia, each of which requires large amounts of fossil fuels to produce. He concludes that those calling for rapid decarbonization to combat global warming are dangerously foolish. ""I see the world as it is,"" Smil told the NTYM interviewer, continuing:"
2273	15	The most important thing to understand is the magnitude. ... According to COP26, we should reduce our carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. That's impossible, because there are only eight years left and emissions continue to rise. People are unaware of the magnitude of the task and set themselves artificial deadlines that are unrealistic. ...
2274	3	Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has admitted that the 2015 ceasefire in Donbass, which he negotiated as Ukraine's President with Russia, France and Germany, was merely a red herring to give Kyiv time to rebuild its military.
2274	5	He made the same comments this week in interviews with several news channels, including Deutsche Welle and the Ukrainian branch of US state broadcaster Radio Free Europe. Poroshenko also defended the record of his presidency from 2014 to 2019. Speaking about the peace agreement, he said:
2274	7	"""We achieved everything we wanted."""
2274	9	"""Our goal was to first stop the threat, or at least delay the war, to allow eight years for restoring economic growth and building strong armed forces."""
2274	11	Megalomania as a mental illness of Ukraine
2274	13	The ex-president referred to Sun Tzu's stratagems, which were an inspiration for the deception. Winning a war does not necessarily mean winning military battles, Poroshenko stressed, calling the agreement he reached a win for Ukraine in this regard. The oligarch was not re-elected in a landslide election against him and for President Vladimir Zelensky. He had promised voters that, unlike his predecessor, he would secure peace in the Donbass.
2274	15	In the interviews, Poroshenko spoke about his role in negotiating the Minsk agreements and a roadmap for reconciliation between his government and the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The former president confirmed that Kyiv had not come to the talks in good faith, but simply wanted a reprieve after a military defeat.
2274	17	The agreements included a number of measures aimed at containing hostilities in the Donbass and reconciling the warring factions. The first steps were a ceasefire and a withdrawal of heavy arms from the front line, supervised by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which were met to some extent.
2274	19	Subsequently, Kyiv should grant the rebels a general amnesty and allow the Donetsk and Lugansk regions extensive autonomy. Ukrainian troops were to take control of rebel-held areas after Kyiv granted them representation and otherwise reincorporated them as part of Ukraine.
2274	20	“Zelensky is a war criminal” – Tribunal on Atrocities of Ukrainian Nationalism
2274	22	Poroshenko's government refused to implement those parts of the deal, claiming it could not go ahead until the border between the insurgent republics and Russia was fully secured. Instead, he advocated an economic blockade of the rebel areas initiated by Ukrainian nationalist forces. Zelensky's presidency initially gave a boost to the peace process, but it stalled again after a series of protests by far-right forces, who threatened to oust Ukraine's new president if he lived up to his campaign promises.
2274	24	Kiev's failure to implement the roadmap and ongoing hostilities with the separatists were among the main reasons Russia cited for its special operation in Ukraine in late February. A few days before the maneuvers began, Moscow recognized the breakaway Ukrainian republics as sovereign states, offered them security guarantees and demanded that Kyiv withdraw its troops. Zelensky refused to comply.
2274	26	Now opposition MP Poroshenko has called on Western states to supply Kyiv with more heavier weapons so that Ukrainian soldiers can “fulfill [the West's] task” and defend Europe against Russia. He also called for further sanctions against Moscow and for his country to join the EU and NATO as soon as possible.
2274	28	The ex-president claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the one who broke the Minsk agreements. It was to his credit that Ukraine did not fall into the hands of Russia within days, as some Western officials had predicted. The country resisted the attack thanks to military reforms implemented by its government. Moscow did not provide a timeline for its military operation in Ukraine, merely stating that it was proceeding as planned.
2276	3	Berlin - Now we finally know why the virus - despite mask terror - was able to spread so wonderfully:
2276	5	In 2020 and 2021, the market surveillance bodies of the federal states found defects, some of them serious, in up to 70 percent of the imported masks, rapid tests and corona protective equipment. This is reported by Business Insider. According to this, tons of products were introduced that were inferior and could not offer sufficient protection against the corona virus.
2276	7	The background is that the federal government reduced the import requirements for masks and other protective goods in spring 2020. Because Germany did not have its own production facilities, for example for FFP2 masks, manufacturers should also be allowed to import products that are not certified according to European quality standards to the German market. The usual check before the introduction was omitted.
2276	9	However, the survey of the authorities shows that manufacturers and importers apparently take advantage of this freedom to a large extent. According to the examiners, forged and incomplete documents were often submitted. In addition, tracking the supply chain was often a challenge for the auditors.
2276	11	"Some dealers refused to take voluntary action after a poor assessment. Sometimes the surveillance authorities could not even locate the importer who was responsible for the import into Germany. ""In most cases, the economic players were unreasonable and argued with the supposed technical effectiveness of the masks, the shortage situation and the negative economic consequences,"" says a spokesman for the Darmstadt authority."
2276	13	"In addition to the high defect rate, what is particularly explosive is that scrap masks are still in circulation today without the ""CE"" product safety seal of approval or other checks. Because although the import of masks and other protective goods was banned on October 1, 2020 without an extra examination, importers who bought from the manufacturers before the deadline can continue to sell them. According to the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, use is permitted until May 31, 2022."
2276	15	Despite the omicron wave and although there is no longer an emergency for the products like at the beginning of the pandemic, the ministry does not want to override the rule any earlier, a spokesman told Business Insider.
2276	17	The clear proof that wearing a mask is not about health, but only about submission.
2277	3	"It's Jair Bolsonaro's latest chutzpah: Instead of fighting the escalating corona pandemic with real measures, the ultra-right Brazilian President is reaching into his bag of tricks: Brazil is no longer publishing total figures on the Internet about the number of people who have contracted or died from Covid-19. True to the motto ""Out of sight, out of mind"", the Brazilian head of state, often dubbed the tropics Trump, wants to cover up his total failure in the fight against the corona pandemic."
2277	5	In an ignorance similar to Trump, Bolsonaro downplayed the dangers of the corona virus and thus facilitated its massive spread. In terms of the number of deaths and infections recorded, Brazil has been in the fast lane for some time - not to mention the number of unreported cases.
2277	7	The fact that he, like Trump, has now also announced that he is leaving the World Health Organization because Brazil does not need outside people to provide health advice shows that he is willing to continue on his course. Two health ministers have already had to resign during the pandemic. The interim minister is a general with no experience in the health field. If the advice of health ministers from the states who oppose Bolsonaro's course does not prevail, the catastrophe will continue unabated.
2278	1	SBU prepares cynical provocation with dead bodies to accuse Russia of war crimes
2278	3	According to our sources in Kyiv, the SBU is preparing a large-scale provocation to accuse Russian troops of mass murder and torture of civilians.
2278	5	For this purpose, the bodies of those killed in SBU custody are transported to the cities of Irpen and Bucha, where bloody fighting took place. As is well known, these cities were abandoned by the Russian troops as part of the redeployment. The Americans instructed the SBU to immediately transport to these cities all those shot in their chambers and to scatter the bodies on the streets and in the destroyed houses. The task was to bring about 300 bodies of dead Ukrainian citizens, including those shot in the SBU cells, to Irpen and Bucha. In particular, the SBU arrested all those who had collaborated with Oleg Tsarev in distributing humanitarian aid in the Borodyanka settlement. They were shot and their bodies were transported to Bucha and Irpin.
2278	7	"The gruesome footage of the dead, most of whom were shot in the back of the head, is being presented to the world media as evidence of the brutal treatment of the local population by Russian troops. According to the ideas of the SBU and its US agents, all of this is to follow the scenario of a staged ""chemical attack"" in the Syrian city of Douma. There, the MI6-controlled White Helmets pseudo-humanitarian organization staged an entire show hosed down on the alleged victims of the Syrian chemical attack. It later turned out that this was all staged by the White Helmets. Witnesses to the attack later testified before the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but the organization's leadership dropped the investigation."
2278	9	"Since the time of Pyotr Poroshenko, the SBU has had a knack for organizing ""death squads"". The militant groups controlled by the SBU have massacred dissidents and even committed high-level assassinations for political reasons. For example, journalist Pavel Sheremet was blown up in his car. Lawyer Yuriy Grabovsky and dozens of other critics of the Poroshenko regime were brutally tortured and killed."
2278	11	"It becomes clear why the SBU has launched a full-scale manhunt across the country for sane people or those who simply advocated cooperation with Russia. Dozens of journalists, public figures and human rights activists have been arrested and many have already been killed. Today their bodies, as well as dozens of others who were shot in SBU cells, are being taken to Irpen and Butscha. In the near future, foreign journalists will also be brought there so that the footage of the ""atrocities committed by the Russian army"" can be broadcast by all the world's media. US intelligence agencies are well aware that in order to perpetuate Russophobia in the West, it is necessary to show horrific videos and footage of staged atrocities. The provocation to shoot down the Malaysian Boeing was organized according to exactly the same scenario."
2278	13	Advisor to the Presidential Office Mikhail Podoliak has already started reproducing images of the bodies on his Twitter feed. Zelensky's next step will be to set up a public commission to gather facts, photos and evidence to accuse Russia of war crimes. The Presidential Office of Ukraine hopes that such a campaign will help reduce the negative impact of all leading Western media outlets publishing the facts about the AFU's brutal treatment of Russian prisoners of war, as well as evidence of the infiltration of Nazi ideology into the AFU.
2279	3	"The German-Russian framework has been crunching for years. The first major crack came at the beginning of 2014, when Germany ""overlooked"" neo-Nazis on Kiev's Maidan and supported the unconstitutional coup in Russia's neighbor. For its part, Germany was outraged that Russia ""annexed"" the Crimean Peninsula, which was seceding from Ukraine."
2279	5	"But the edifice of German-Russian relations did not collapse. Because there was Minsk. Russian diplomacy was well aware that Berlin would not reprimand its Maidan foster children for their sabotage of the Minsk agreements. But the Russians were working together with Germans on the ""Nord Stream 2"" energy supply project and therefore refrained from harsh criticism of their economic partners. In fact, these partners had long since left the Minsk process."
2279	7	"Then came the ""Russian war of aggression against Ukraine"" – as Berlin sees it. The history of the invasion and Berlin's role in it, Merkel's ""great game against Putin"", was completely ignored. Olaf Scholz terminated the German-Russian ""special relations"" that were allegedly still remaining at the time. German politicians directed their angry philippics at Moscow, and the media began to paint the Russian president as the Adolf Hitler of the present day. Russia is now not worthy of remembering the victory over Nazism, was the Federal Chancellor's tenor during his speech on May 8th. German companies such as Siemens had previously withdrawn from the Russian business, and Nord Stream 2 was stopped with great pathos by the Germans."
2279	9	Official Moscow reacted irritably, but refrained from explicit anti-German rhetoric. When Berlin began to deliver German live ammunition and large weapon systems to the Kiev regime, the last dams that prevented the Russians from reviving anti-German resentment in social communication were broken in the media. The Germans only owe their carefree existence to Putin's love for Germany, according to one of the voices.
2279	11	"The Russian President, who is considered a self-confessed Germanophile, was silent when German politicians made arrogant speeches and polemicized with the ""common West"" – without emphasizing Germany. Berlin, meanwhile, increasingly accused Moscow of all the evils in the world - including the use of ""hunger as a weapon"" and barbarism in general."
2279	13	"Then the Chancellor appeared with another keynote address. With his own sense of date symbolism, Scholz delivered a confrontational speech in the Bundestag on June 22, the anniversary of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. In it he announced a new turning point and promised financial and military support for Ukraine - ""until Putin finally recognizes his colossal misjudgment."""
2279	15	"Scholz mentioned Russia and Putin eighteen times in his speech. He canceled the partnership with ""Putin's aggressive, imperialist Russia for the foreseeable future"" and recalled German cities destroyed in World War II. Scholz did not mention by whom and why they were destroyed. On the other hand, he accused Russia of a ""barbaric war against women, the elderly and children""."
2279	17	"He also promised that Germany would also play a special military role in the European security architecture in the future, especially with regard to the so-called ""eastern flank"". However, he has not explained how to achieve a European security space with a state like Ukraine, which worships bloody Nazis and makes revanchism, oppression and Russophobic ultranationalism an ideological doctrine."
2279	19	"The Chancellor showed that he thinks globally and is determined to fight together with other ""democracies in the world"" ""against Putin's imperialism, but also in the fight against hunger and poverty, against health crises and climate change""."
2279	21	The new hawks from the opposition, such as Friedrich Merz, did not object to this speech, because it contained all their positions anyway. unity in hatred. Even the last Russian-eaters in this country are satisfied with this speech, including disappointed intellectual romantics like the historians Karl Schlögel and Gerd Koenen.
2279	23	"For years, the author of the ""Russian complex,"" Koenen, has been preaching that the last remnants of Germany's romanticism toward Russia should be abolished until German-Russian relations become ""stink normal."" But that will only happen if the full force of the moral value canon of a Germany in its new manifestation as a do-gooder applies to Russia as well."
2279	25	Yes, almost forgot. Right at the beginning of his speech on that memorable day on June 22, Olaf Scholz confirmed with satisfaction that the German self-propelled howitzers had finally reached their new area of ​​operations:
2279	28	"""Ukraine is getting the weapons that it particularly needs in the current phase of the war. I spoke to the Ukrainian President about precisely these supplies and these weapons. We are supplying them today and in the future."""
228	3	“The European Commission presented proposals to expand legal migration as part of its migration and asylum package. But the EU is only concerned with setting up further legal entry routes to Europe in order to get cheap labour,” explained today, Thursday, Harald Vilimsky, head of the Liberal delegation in the European Parliament, on the EU Commission's plan to simplify labor migration to the EU to want.
228	5	Europe is withdrawing skilled workers from their countries of origin
228	7	“But it is precisely these 'talent partnerships' that lead to a general deterioration in the countries of origin. For example, schooling is no longer offered when well-educated people are leaving the country anyway. Furthermore, there is displacement on the labor market in the EU and, on top of that, there is an increase in the pressure to migrate to Europe,” emphasized Vilimsky.
228	9	Against the interests of European citizens
228	11	"""If workers are now allowed to come more easily to the countries of the Union, that would also be an incentive that would not only fuel the influx, but also put the labor markets under massive pressure. If we now start opening the gates even wider to third-country nationals, that would be a totally irresponsible policy against the interests of European citizens. Unfortunately, that fits seamlessly into the Brussels mixture of inability and unwillingness to limit the mass influx into the Union,"" criticized Vilimsky."
228	13	Combat the shortage of skilled workers in Germany
228	15	"""If there is a shortage of skilled workers, the fault lies with the individual EU member states, which apparently do not train in the labor market. This is where we should start instead of forcing mass immigration,” Vilimsky demanded. ""The allegedly better control of legal migration on the part of the EU is merely a further step towards undermining national sovereignty and thus our own scope for action in migration,"" says Vilimsky."
228	17	Illegal mass migration is relabelled
228	19	"A ""strict no"" to the EU Commission's proposal came today from FPÖ security spokesman Hannes Amesbauer: ""The fact that the Brussels Eurocrats can think of nothing better to do with the existing shortage of skilled workers in many areas than to put a large-scale migration offensive on the table is true not surprising, but nevertheless to be rejected completely. But to glorify this project as an instrument against illegal migration is outrageous. It means nothing other than relabeling and legalizing illegal mass migration instead of finally establishing effective external border protection to prevent it in the long term.”"
228	21	Austria must put in a clear veto in Brussels
228	23	"""If the People's Party has just a spark of honesty towards its voters - to whom it has promised a restrictive migration policy - I expect the ÖVP Chancellor Karl Nehammer, ÖVP Interior Minister Gerhard Karner and ÖVP Labor Minister Martin Kocher to immediately reject the move EU Commission,” emphasized Amesbauer and added: “Unfortunately, it is to be feared that the ÖVP will then fall over, as always in Brussels. While the media always wants to portray itself as a hardliner in asylum and migration policy, there is a lack of will and backbone to consistently reject such bad proposals in Brussels. And with the Greens as a coalition partner, the ÖVP also lacks the necessary corrective on these issues.”"
2280	1	Ex-US President Obama becomes a “prepper” hoards propane gas in giant tanks at home
2280	3	According to media reports, the former US President and still active climate fighter, Barack Obama, has three huge propane gas tanks built on his noble property in Martha's Vineyard south of Cape Cod in Mssachusetts. He's obviously hedging against rising prices in the US, which are about to rise by more than half. The average US household doesn't have that privilege.
2280	4	"Obama becomes ""Prepper"""
2280	6	"Local media became aware of Obama's ""prepper measures"". Whether he actually became a lateral thinker remains a secret. ""Preppers"" who are preparing for self-sufficiency because they no longer trust the state - and rightly so - have recently been referred to as right-wing extremists. In any case, the responsible approval authority was astonished at the extent of the tanks, which is unprecedented for private individuals."
2280	7	Gas for me but not for her...
2280	9	"The local Daily Caller got wind of it and loudly headlined its Obama report: ""Gas for me but not for them"". The newspaper was told by the Edgartown, Mass. permitting agency that an application had been made for an underground propane gas facility at 79 Turkeyland Cove Road -- a property Obama owns. The tanks are used for private purposes. Two of the tanks each hold almost 4,000 liters, one tank almost 2,000 liters of propane gas. Daily Caller reached out to Obama for comment on his new facility, which has so far not materialized."
2280	10	lying politician
2280	12	"Obviously, Obama is one of those politicians who preach water and drink wine. Because during his term in office, he was the one who promoted the topic of climate change to the point of hysteria, highly propagated renewable energies, demanded a limitation of the use of fossil fuels and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by almost a third below the level of 2005. In 2021 Obama gave a speech at the COP26 climate summit and accused mankind of having wounded the planet with ""their actions"", especially with regard to global temperature developments."
2280	13	No clean energy
2280	15	While propane has fewer CO2 emissions, it is a fossil fuel that Obama has strongly opposed to using. The system he commissioned is not exactly environmentally friendly. Propane is colorless combustible gas, hydrocarbon. It is formed with petroleum and butane, is released from petroleum fields by separating it from other hydrocarbons and refining (separating and collecting the gas from its petroleum sources. It is liquefied under pressure and stored in this way. When propane gas burns, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc. are formed , carbon monoxide, methane, etc. Americans who use it to heat their homes will pay half as much in the near future, according to the US Energy Information Agency.
2280	16	60s party at the peak of the pandemic
2280	18	Obama's multi-million dollar home was also the scene of an extravagant celebration for his 60s with 475 guests at the peak of the Corona Delta variant outbreak in the summer of 2021. The guests came by private jet, among other things.
2281	1	All against Rächz: Historic success for Le Pen
2281	3	"The majority for the banker puppet has melted away. Macron became a macronette and the one that now has to bake smaller rolls. Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National won 89 seats - more than ten times as many as in 2017. But the historic result for the right-wing conservative party was almost doubled by the left-wing alliance ""Nupes"" around Jean-Luc Mélenchon. According to the latest projections, up to 180 seats are possible. For Macron's ""Ensemble!"" there is still the largest chunk with up to 250 seats, but power must now be shared. This now results in the usual tactic of the ""all against revenge"" game, which has been tried and tested for a long time in Germany."
2281	5	"Macron will have to make ""concessions,"" but these ""impositions"" will affect all French people, no matter how many social benefits the left coalition can churn out that no budget will cover."
2281	7	Either Putin, climate change, Corona or the Germans are to blame for the misery, which could be punished by cutting off cheap nuclear power, because of course gas prices are also rising in France and not everyone wants to tumble into oblivion as obediently and selflessly as the sleeping Michel .
2281	9	"In France, however, one saves on inflated state expenditures for the fight against Rächz. Le Pen is far too valuable to be a bogeyman. Should she ever play a larger role, the shadow forces already have a plan B in their pockets with the scenario from Houellebecq's novel ""Soumission"". The question is whether submission to Islam is still necessary before the Great Reset shuts down the entire continent, the Russians invade and the Eiffel Tower is plastered by a cruise missile, or Godzilla emerges from the English Channel and dinosaur pox calls for another lockdown."
2282	1	Religious leaders say Covid shots to blame for rise in 'demonic possession'
2282	3	"There are now so many ""fully vaccinated"" people showing strong signs of demonic possession that a new St. Michael Center for Spiritual Liberation and Exorcism is opening in Manila, Philippines."
2282	5	According to reports, exorcisms are to be performed there on people who have been vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Father Jose Francisco Syquia says he receives about 10 reports a day of demons invading the bodies of those who are vaccinated.
2282	7	The Roman Catholic Church is responsible for the construction, which is reportedly the first of its kind in Asia. Priests will be trained in the art of exorcising demons, and Syquia, the director of the archdiocese, will hold the post of chief exorcist.
2282	9	The official rumor is that the pandemic and all the stresses it brings are responsible for the increase in demon possession, but in reality vaccinations are also a big part of it.
2282	11	"""As a result of more than seven years of prayer, planning and fundraising, this will be the first center of its kind in Asia, if not the world,"" the archdiocese said."
2282	13	"""This center will take care of those who are in bondage to the devil, who are the poorest of the poor and are usually overlooked."""
2282	15	Syquia says demons texted him after exorcisms
2282	17	The facility will have special rooms where not only exorcisms but also talks and consultations can be performed.
2282	19	"""Total possession,"" according to Syquia, accounts for only about 20 percent of all exorcisms performed by the Roman Catholic Church. Most exorcisms, Syquia says, are performed on people who are being ""physically molested"" by evil spirits."
2282	21	"In the past three to five years, Syquia added, there has been a ""proliferation"" of witchcraft in people's homes, which is also a factor in the current crisis."
2282	23	Launched in 2005, the first Vatican-sanctioned exorcism course is designed to train priests not only in Manila but around the world in the art of exorcising demons from people's bodies and lives.
2282	25	The Manila facility will serve as the headquarters of the Philippine Association of Catholic Exorcists (PACE), which reports to the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.
2282	27	After performing the exorcism ritual on some people, Syquia said the exorcised demons texted him later. In one instance, he is said to have seen a woman levitate after being possessed and the demon later sending threatening messages to his office phone.
2282	29	While Syquia was speaking to the woman and her companion, the phone was in a completely different room, he says.
2282	31	"""The devil has power over everything that is electric,"" the archdiocese is quoted as saying, adding that the message it received from the alleged demon accused him of being a sinner and a liar."
2282	33	"""For example, if this place is infested and they want to make themselves known, the lights usually flicker. If I was giving a lecture and using a certain device, the devil would just turn it off because he's an expert on all things electricity."""
2282	35	"In the United States, demon possession is in full swing right now, especially now that we've hit Pride Month. Everywhere, children are being dragged by their parents and guardians to parades and bars where transgender drag queens flaunt their fake body parts and read them books on ""gender identity."""
2282	37	"""Demonic activity and even possession are clearly on the rise,"" someone wrote in response to news of the new exorcism facility. “Those involved in the occult and witchcraft are particularly at risk."
2283	1	Economic summit in Saint Petersburg: Putin explains the situation to western dream dancers
2283	3	In a long speech at the economic summit in St. Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin took a long time to present his view of the global economic situation and the traditional attitudes of the western world. He didn't say anything that couldn't be understood.
2283	5	“Our country is suffering. Our economy is in shambles. Inflation is out of control. Gasoline prices are higher than ever. Cargo ships cannot unload their cargo. Families with small children do not receive baby food. Our nation is being exposed before the world.” Wait a minute. Putin didn't say that. It wasn't about Russia either. It was Donald Trump who, in an article about the length of Putin's speech in St. Petersburg, detailed how Americans were cheated of a legitimately elected president in the 2020 US election.
2283	7	Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin - what about Joe Biden? A video shows him falling off his bike somewhere in America during the Saint Petersburg Economic Summit while trying to get off. Luckily he had a helmet on. But that's symbolic. In fact, Putin said in St. Petersburg that the Western elites would not be able to stay in the saddle much longer before reality crushed them to the ground. The disturbing thing is that with Putin, unlike Joe Biden, one can understand how he arrives at his statements.
2283	9	Colonial Empire America
2283	11	Vladimir Putin outlined the western world as essentially a colonial empire in which one country, the US, calls the shots and everyone else would lead a vassal life with American pro-kings at the head of their respective nations. The best-behaved US vassals are the Europeans in the EU, so good that they pursue economic policies even against the interests of their own nations. Although the sanctions hit Russia hard, they hit those who imposed them harder. According to Putin, the time for a unipolar world order is over and any attempt to prolong it is doomed to failure. The Russian market remains open to anyone who wants to cooperate economically with Russia. But there will be an end to the bad Western habit of sucking the poorer countries dry with inflation, with the Americans inflating the dollar as the world's leading currency in order to pay for real goods with increasingly worthless scraps of paper.
2283	13	A general reorganization of world monetary policy is indicated, in which finance-capitalist and real-economy organized national economies face each other. The fact that the balance sheet totals of central banks were simply increased out of the blue using the printing press, without the corresponding values ​​being compared to the money supply in circulation, has no future. For example, the amount of money in circulation in the dollar has increased by 38 percent in the past two years alone, without there being any backing. In contrast to the Western European countries, Russia has almost infinite resources that need to be used, which is why it is important to focus on them.
2283	15	The Ukraine War
2283	17	"In front of the delegations from over 40 countries, including China, Turkey, Egypt and various nations from Asia and Africa, Vladimir Putin also explained in St. Petersburg what Russia is about with the ""military special operation"" in Ukraine. At least he would like it to be understood that way. The main goal of the ""military special operation"" is to defend the mostly Russian population in the Donbass in a war that has been waged against them in Ukraine itself since 2014. In addition, Russian troops in the Donbass fought to ensure Russia's own development. Putin: ""The West has fundamentally refused to honor its earlier commitments, which is why there is no point in trying again with new treaties."""
2283	19	"He was probably addressing both the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in which the territorial integrity of a sovereign and neutral Ukraine was guaranteed by Russia, the USA and Great Britain. Gradually, however, the neutrality of the Ukraine was gradually eroded in the following years to such an extent that finally there was talk of an anti-Russian US vassal state par excellence, which although officially not a member of NATO was de facto treated by NATO as be he already one. In addition, Putin is likely to have pointed to Ukraine's breach of the Minsk agreements. ""In the current situation,"" said the Russian President, ""against the background of ever-increasing risks and an increasing threat to us, the Russian decision to conduct this military special operation - although difficult - was a forced and necessary decision"". This may be taken for a pretended justification for war, but anyone who wants to can hardly refute it."
2283	21	perspectives
2283	23	In the long term, in view of the decline of finance capitalism, it will remain essential for the European economies to return to a product and value-based economic order. Russian raw materials are indispensable for such a process, so that the embargo on Russian raw materials cannot be maintained for too long. The sooner this insight comes, the better for everyone. The fact that an era in the western world is also coming to an end politically and that a reorientation must take place, which cannot be implemented with the same personnel who have so far stubbornly resisted this insight, presents the western world with the problem of coming to terms with its own Having to deal with business and political elites. They, in turn, have long since understood that for themselves it can only be a matter of bagging what there is still to bag. The statement by WEF founder Schwab, according to which nobody will own anything in 2030 - and that everyone will like it, has a real reason that is less based on an idea than on an economic inevitability if the course is not set again as soon as possible will. While inflation is eating away at citizens' assets at an ever-increasing rate, states are apologizing in this way – and the assets of the global clique of multi-billionaires are growing exorbitantly.
2285	3	The surgeon, radiologist, university professor and President of the Union of Surgeons and Dentists of Rome, Dr. In an interview, Antonio Magi described the “Green Passport” as meaningless and illogical. Even vaccinated people can infect themselves and others with the corona virus. Unvaccinated people should therefore no longer be presented as a danger to the public. He also criticized the suppression of scientific knowledge, called for a return to rationality and rejected compulsory vaccination.
2285	5	Italian Medical Association boss against compulsory vaccination
2285	6	Based on scientific facts
2285	7	Surreal ideology tunnel
2285	8	The Green Passport is useless
2285	9	Because vaccinated people can infect themselves and others
2285	11	Surreal ideology tunnel
2285	13	"The green passport, which entitles you to travel across the EU on the basis of 3G (vaccinated, recovered, tested), has no “hygiene logic”, Magi told the online medium RomaIT. If vaccinated people can also become infected and infect others - what use is the Green Passport then? Based on this scientific evidence, one must immediately leave this ""surreal ideological tunnel"" and return to rationality. It is wrong to present unvaccinated people as a ""public danger"". They are potentially a danger to themselves, they can become infected and develop no symptoms or severe symptoms."
2285	15	Schizophrenic campaign for two-class society
2285	17	"Above all, the vaccination protects the vaccinated person. That is the main thing. If everyone protects themselves, everyone is protected. One must stop calling non-vaccinated people “no vax”. This would lead to a two-tier society and a social split towards apartheid. This is not about a “movement” but about individual citizens. Magi spoke of a ""schizophrenic communication campaign"" between lockdowns and easing."
2285	19	Side effects concealed, experts suppressed
2285	21	He criticized that side effects of vaccinations that were then made public had been concealed. Existing drugs against Covid-19 and voices from experts who consider mass vaccination in the middle of a pandemic to be “dangerous and crazy” have also been suppressed. In addition, the previously vaccinated gene sera have not yet completed all clinical trial phases. On this basis, vaccination can only be voluntary and optional. Protected by strict data protection rules so as not to foment conflict between citizens - when making a decision that only affects their own security.
2285	23	What's in the vaccine?
2285	25	In Italy and many other countries around the world, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent days and protested against the planned introduction of compulsory vaccination - for the time being for health and nursing staff, including massive sanctions for those who are not vaccinated. Many people now know what Magi addressed in the interview. More and more users on social media are therefore asking themselves: what is in this vaccine that politicians around the world want to impose on people with such vehemence and with massive threats.
2286	1	Nothing works anymore
2286	2	Political Roulette The West bet on the wrong numbers.
2286	4	"Politics is a strategy game in which it is necessary to think as far ahead as possible and to calculate with different variants. The propensity of Western politicians to drive on sight and practice politics as a game of chance is therefore inappropriate. In roulette, which is a pure game of chance, the player bets on specific numbers, such as odd or even. He has a certain amount of time for that. Finally the croupier says ""Rien ne va plus"" - ""I can't do it anymore"" and lets the ball roll. From this moment on, the player is at the mercy of fate. There can also be such a moment in politics. Only there the probability of winning the even and the odd numbers is rarely the same. It seems to me that Western politicians have already missed the moment when the croupier spoke. The ball is rolling and it won't land on a number that our side bet on."
2286	6	Even if a correction should still be possible, it is not to be expected. Public discussion in the West is stuck in old ways of thinking. She recognizes neither the character of this war nor the magnitude of the challenge. Politicians and journalists convince themselves of a superiority that no longer exists. As a result, they hinder thinking about which changes in direction are necessary and possible. The fact that politics is the art of the possible is generally considered outdated. However, the impossible will most certainly not happen.
2286	8	Hybrid war and how it came about
2286	10	One of the fallacies of current western politics is that there is a Ukraine war that can be limited to this country. Russia has been waging a hybrid war against the political West since February 24. The military attack on Ukraine is just one aspect of this hybrid war, the economic component of which is far more important. With this attack, Russia created a situation to which the West had to react. Putin knew full well that the West would react in an uncoordinated manner and in a way that was primarily detrimental to the West itself.
2286	12	How one assesses the character of this war has a major impact on what strategy one believes to be correct. If it were a pure war over Ukraine, then Russia would have been interested in a quick military victory. The narrative of a miscalculation by Putin would be credible. If, on the other hand, this military conflict is only one aspect of a larger attack on the entire West, then it is in Russia's interest to tie up and destroy as many Western resources as possible. In such a scenario, a quick end to the military conflict would be disadvantageous from the Russian point of view.
2286	14	I don't want to doubt that there were strategists on the western side, especially in the US, who recognized this situation. The offer to evacuate Zelenskyj abroad from Kyiv very soon after the start of the war speaks in favor of this. However, the Russian side had better foreseen the Ukrainian reaction. She also had better ways of controlling that response. Putin also correctly calculated that the West could not drop Ukraine unless it did so very quickly. The West was drawn deep into the conflict without Russia having to take any escalating steps towards the West on its own in the first three months. It was enough to respond to Western escalation steps at the same or even slightly lower level. The West, which did not anticipate the scenario of a long dispute, was not prepared for it either. He reacted confused. Conflicting interests emerged. To date, the West has not taken any action that goes significantly beyond symbolic politics. This inadequate response was easy to predict. For at least a decade, Western politics has been symbolic in essence. The entire political and media class is trapped in this way of thinking and acting. She cultivates a groupthink, which would be better described as group thoughtlessness.
2286	16	The above considerations explain how Putin arrived at the view that Russia, from an intrinsically economically inferior position, could wage and even win a hybrid war against the West. But they don't explain why Putin saw this war as advantageous. Such a war must also lead to economic and military losses for Russia. However, it should be undisputed that in the second half of February, after weighing up all the circumstances, he viewed this war as advantageous. Otherwise, Putin, who sees himself as a great strategist, would not have started the war. Above all, he must have taken into account the relatively quick end of the oil, gas and coal deals with the West. This is evident from the fact that Russia followed a pre-war strategy that led to low natural gas reserves in western storage facilities and that Russia is now dictating the pace of exiting the gas business itself.
2286	18	In doing so, Putin broke with an economic strategy pursued by the Soviet Union and Russia for at least 50 years with good results. Why? The answer to that is relatively simple. In any case, this economic strategy had no future after Western Europe decided to stop importing fossil fuels for a period of less than two decades. Russia could have lost this deal insidiously and on Western terms, or it could shut down the deal on its own terms and find new buyers when the time was right. The only problem with a shutdown on its own terms was that it would send a signal to Russia that it was not a reliable supplier. This in turn would have made it more difficult to conclude long-term contracts with other customers. The West solved this problem for Putin by breaching the contract as part of “sanctions”. However, this is just a blemish in western strategy. The major mistake is to believe that the West can afford to break off this business relationship as well as, or even better than, Russia. Here the central lie of the western zeitgeist is touched on, the assertion that one can do without fossil carbon sources in the foreseeable future.
2288	1	"""Energy transition"" is like taking a roast Christmas goose to the vet"
2288	3	Isn't the sum of around 100 billion euros per year in support for renewable energies per year for all subsidies, EEG surcharges, CO2 tax, tax breaks, purchase premiums for e-cars, state support programs for all sorts of things already far too high for our economy ? According to the government's plans, these expenses will increase enormously.

2288	7	"""The lack of competence, knowledge and education is nothing more obvious than the wrong use of terms and units."" Basic knowledge of physics and mathematics is not available in politics and the public relations media. Power and energy are misused all the time. Ignorance reigns when it comes to capacity, efficiency and the laws of thermodynamics. Mega, giga or tera: it doesn't matter. What kind of nonsense comes out of it is shown by these examples:"
2288	9	“A wind turbine generates 5 megawatts of electricity (ARD). The sun does not send an invoice (GREEN). Nuclear and coal power block the lines (Professor C. Kemfert). There are many gigabytes in the power grid (Cem Özdemir). Cooling towers smoke (WDR). The FFF movement: If the ice at the North Pole has melted, the sea level will rise.” The children should have gone to school on Fridays and learned something from Archimedes.
2288	11	Daniel Günther, MP of Schleswig-Holstein, recently claimed in Die Welt that its 1.9 GW wind power capacity generated more electricity than the Brokdorf NPP with 1.4 GW. In truth, the NPP generated 3.5 times as much electricity, unit: GWh. Who is dumber here, what do you think? The politician without basic knowledge or the newspaper that has no idea about the topic and doesn't correct anything?
2288	13	"Do you know that ""renewable energy"" doesn't actually exist? Energy cannot be created, destroyed, consumed, or regenerated. Energy can only ever be converted or stored. At the end of all processes there is only heat. The sun constantly emits radiant energy. This can be converted into electricity via PV and wind. Solar energy is chemically stored in coal, oil and gas. Nuclear binding forces can be released in the uranium nucleus, which generate heat. If you have dropped out of physics at school, you can of course know nothing about the conservation laws..."
2289	1	A new church, a new faith, a new people
2289	3	Church adapts to the zeitgeist. Now it has not only adapted, but completely submitted to the neo-pagan climate religion. To always and constantly worship the climate, to think of the climate in everything one does, is the preamble, so to speak, to the new catechism of the climate church.
2289	5	The Christian churches have said goodbye to Christianity. They see patriarchal and familistic Christianity, the conspiracy theory of the Trinity, and the reactionary doctrine of the out-of-this-world empire as outdated. They replace the trinity of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit with the triad of climate apocalypticism, genderism and identity politics. Not the cross, but the renunciation for reasons of climate justice paves the way to paradise, which is praised strictly within the world as a climate-neutral society. The churches have chosen as their new god the climate they now ecstatically worship.
2289	7	"Every century has its own irrationalism, which is always totalitarian because it knows no rationality. The new irrationalism of the 21st century is climate worship. ""The climate issue is one that we are dealing with at all levels of our church, from the congregation to the EKD,"" says 26-year-old Anna-Nicole Heinrich, President of the EKD. Heinrich estimates more correctly than you probably realize: ""We are a church, a community that has always been changing, that has always been adapting..."" To the spirit of the times. Now the church has not only conformed, but fully submitted to the neo-pagan climate religion. Always and constantly worshiping the climate, thinking about the climate in everything you do, so that you don't harm the climate, is the preamble, so to speak, to the new catechism of the climate church."
2289	9	Of course, “butterflies and insects” are not becoming rare, and “birds are disappearing” not because of the wind farm rotors, but because of the metaphysical entities of “summer glory with heat waves and lack of precipitation”, as Annette Kurschus, Chairwoman of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, puts it , as brave as they are ignorant, but asserted that they have a strong belief in the climate. Because the climate is very angry about our guilt, about the great sins of the wicked and sinners of the global north, who have so horribly violated the climate god children of the global south. The climate shaman of the EKD, Kühnbaum-Schmidt, seconded the Council President with the new dogma: Global climate justice also plays a role in this.
2289	11	"A very large proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by a wealthy minority of the world's population. ""Those who suffer the most from the consequences of climate change are least responsible for it - currently dramatically visible in Bangladesh and India."" At this point, Kühnbaum-Schmidt redefines faith as the attitude that is to be adopted after successfully denied knowledge. Because in reality, i.e. outside the climate church, China and India, as named by Kühnbaum-Schmidt, cause 30.3 percent and 6.8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, respectively, while highly industrialized Germany only causes 1.8 percent of emissions. This puts Germany behind China, the USA, India, Russia and Japan. That China and India, which together account for almost 40 percent of emissions, are least ""responsible"" for climate change, one has to believe against better knowledge. The floods in Bangladesh, to which the climate shaman alludes, even represent the opposite of climate change, namely climate constancy."
2289	13	"With the conversion to the climate church, the churches have also given up the claim to transcendence. Instead of looking at the perspective of the empire out of this world, they fight like a political party, like an ideological pressure group for an inner-worldly salvation. Her new salvation is now called climate justice, her paradise climate-neutral society. The Synod of the Northern Church proclaims: ""Together with the ""Churches for Future"" alliance, the ZMÖ also urgently calls on church actors to make climate protection and climate justice even more of an issue than before. “Church climate protection measures are currently far from sufficient. The time has come for us as churches to step up and take our share of the responsibility,” says a joint appeal."
2292	1	Next inflation shock! One euro now costs 117 cents
2292	3	Things just aren't getting any better: inflation in the euro area is taking on increasingly threatening proportions. On Monday afternoon, one euro cost 117 cents for the first time. That is a jump in price of 17 percent since the beginning of the year. Experts are concerned.
2292	5	"The fact that inflation does not stop at the euro is a worrying development, according to Johannes Nebelsiek from the Institute for the World Economy. ""Until now, it was considered indisputable that a euro always costs around 100 cents."""
2292	7	The consequences for consumers and entrepreneurs are painfully felt. It is self-explanatory that everything is becoming more expensive overall. What is new is the fact that amounts that are out of round or the issuing of change will have to be converted differently in future. Many retailers do not want to subject their customers or checkout staff to this and have therefore rounded up all product prices to whole euro amounts, which further increases the price increase.
2292	9	Employees who have previously received their salary in cents are also particularly affected by the rise in the euro to 117 cents. You are advised to switch to paying in euros as soon as possible.
2292	11	"In view of these developments, according to Nebelsiek, it is probably only a matter of time before the cent is also more severely affected by inflation. ""We have to be prepared for anything now,"" explains the expert. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we have to pay a cent to two cents before the fall."""
2293	1	Allah akbar! 92 percent more asylum applications - but hardly any Ukrainians
2293	3	The repopulation of this continent is in full swing and can report one immigration record after another: 92 percent more asylum applications have already been made in the EU than in the same period last year. Among them but as good as no Ukrainians. Destination country for the Islamic migrant army: Germany, as before.
2293	5	The EU asylum agency EUAA can once again report a new immigration record to those in power in Brussels: by June 14, 339,984 people in the EU had already applied for asylum for the first time. However, despite the allegedly raging Ukraine war, only a small fraction of the asylum seekers among the migrant army come from the Eastern European country. With 22,700 they make just 6.7 percent of the applications. A special rule allows Ukrainians to be recognized directly as civil war refugees without any asylum procedure or examination.
2293	7	Most asylum seekers still come from Islamic countries. 42,900 Afghans and 34,900 Syrians sought asylum in the EU in the first five and a half months of the year. According to the EUAA, with the exception of around 23,000 Venezuelans who prefer to stay in Spain, they prefer to move straight on to Germany.
2293	9	So that Germany can be irreversibly changed by migration, the traffic light coalition is stepping on the gas. More dual citizenship, family reunification for migrants, fast naturalization after just three years, children born in Germany to foreign parents automatically become Germans at birth and more visa options, as well as fast – and of course positive for the migrant – asylum procedures.
2293	11	"This is just a small selection from the left-green magic box that is now supposed to finally change this country under the motto ""Germany for migrants""."
2295	1	West in dead end
2295	3	"Isolating Russia remains one of the three major goals the West is pursuing in its power struggle against Moscow, alongside the goal of ""weakening"" the country militarily (US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin) and ""ruining"" it economically with unprecedented sanctions « (Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock). It can be said that the Western powers have failed so far. Even if almost three quarters of all states reject the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Almost no state beyond the West is willing to join its orgies of sanctions against Russia. Sympathy for the transatlantic demand not to talk to Russian government officials is also extremely thin on the ground."
2295	5	The meeting of the G20 foreign ministers puts this before the eyes of world public opinion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Bali on Thursday from Vietnam where he had spoken with his counterpart there. A day earlier he had met the Mongolian foreign minister in Ulan Bator. On the fringes of the G20 meeting, which he is attending personally, he wanted to confer with the foreign ministers of China, Wang Yi, and Turkey, Mevlut Cavusoglu. The government of Cambodia also announced yesterday that it had invited Lavrov to meetings of the Southeast Asian state association ASEAN in early August. There can be no talk of isolation.
2295	7	And the G20 foreign ministers meeting? The pressure exerted by the Western powers on Indonesia, the current G20 leader, was immense, forcing the country not to invite Russian officials to G20 meetings at all. As for the G20 summit in Bali in mid-November, the pressure not to host President Vladimir Putin continues unabated. So far, Indonesia has held its ground. With a view to the meeting of foreign ministers in Bali, the West ultimately failed: Lavrov is taking part. Its presence will be visible on TV screens worldwide - a serious bust for the West.
2295	9	What to do? At the G20 finance ministers' meeting in April, some Western powers put on a show: finance ministers and central bank governors from the USA, Canada and Great Britain left the room with great fanfare in a PR-effective manner because Russia's deputy finance minister was present. Of course, this did not change the state of affairs at all: Half of the G20 countries have not given in to the demand to isolate Russia to this day. What Antony Blinken, Baerbock and their G7 counterparts are offering the television cameras this time to make an impression worldwide was not yet clear on Thursday. The problem: If the G7 ministers boycott the meeting, they isolate themselves. In order to appease the wild west, Indonesia has invited Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba as a guest. Maybe that's enough for Baerbock and Co.

2295	17	"- Letter to the editor from Ronald Prang from Berlin (July 8, 2022 at 00:23) The struggle for world domination began in 1990, after Yeltsin dissolved the Soviet Union. Yeltsin had trusted that the United States would accept him as an equal partner. After the fragmentation of the former USSR, the Americans downgraded Russia to a regional power. It was necessary to establish the ex-Soviet states as ""subjects"" of the USA, the explosive expansion of NATO was the first step towards submission, they went all the way to the Russian border. The economically weak Yeltsin Russia was no longer an opponent. It was necessary to isolate Russia in order to focus on China, the main global enemy. The game almost worked, Biden dreams that the damned war in Ukraine will weaken and isolate Russia for as long as possible. Russia's isolation has already failed. World domination in the hands of the USA is not what the countries of Asia want. The weak EU, fragmented in the national interests of its members, submits to the demands of the USA to a large extent to the detriment of the Europeans. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla and others have subjugated the world economically, with the exception of China, now it is about political subjugation. While I wish this war in Ukraine to end quickly, as much as I condemn Russia's attack, I fear US world domination even more. But who wants to prevent that? Should planet earth actually fall into the hands of US capitalism? Will China succeed in taking over the role of the USSR? I don't know, that scares me, I know too little about the Chinese system called socialism. The future is the time that is coming, I said as a young person, now I hope I no longer have to live through the final phase of capitalism. I'm pessimistic, that doesn't really suit a Left.Answers"
2298	1	With Marine Le Pen, a right-wing populist takes over the leadership of the parliamentary group
2298	3	"The National Assembly has just become the stage for an obscene flirtation: the president's party has chosen two right-wing extremists from the Rassemblement National (RN) as vice-presidents of parliament. In the first ballot, with an absolute majority. The far right, in turn, gave way to a Macronist leader who blew them kisses. A deal is a deal. The Macronists politely applauded the speech of the parliamentary doyen of the RN, who regretted the loss of the Algerian colony in 1962 and shed a tear for the putschist generals of the colonial war (500,000 dead). Marine Le Pen called this ""a great moment for democracy"". As one minister's spin doctor puts it: ""When Marine Le Pen takes power in five years, this week will be remembered as the first sequence of her rise."""
2298	5	"But Emmanuel Macron sticks to the old doctrine of capital: ""Everything, just not left."" In parliament and the population, he has clearly lost the majority for his neoliberal policies. The left coalition Nupes around Jean-Luc Mélenchon almost became the strongest force. That is why the president needs an authoritarian turn for the further neoliberal restructuring of France. Without hesitation, he razed the ""cordon sanitaire"" with which the right-wing extremists in democracies are usually kept at a distance. Macron can hardly avoid Le Pen. For years he jazzed her up as his favorite opponent. Now she has entered Parliament at the head of 89 deputies, as the third strongest force. All chalk in the voice. Le Pen is on the march, she has her eyes firmly on the 2027 presidential election. No one can claim not to have read their program: national preference, abolish basic rights (“human rights babble”) by referendum, open fire for the police. And she has already assured capital of her submission."
2298	7	"This flirtation takes on bizarre forms: when the Nupes man Eric Coquerel was elected President of the Finance Commission, Le Pen, in chorus with employers, Macronists and other right-wingers, sang an outraged lament: Here, she says, is a dam of democracy "" against the extremists”. It can go that fast."
2299	1	High costs and cold feet
2299	3	"The price increases are continuing: the persistently high cost of living is likely to make everyday life even more difficult for wage earners in the future. Households with low and middle incomes in particular will be hit by rising energy and rent prices this year. In view of the explosive social situation, the central association of the housing industry (GdW) seems to be getting cold feet: At its annual press conference on Thursday, the situation was described as ""dramatic"" and social peace was ""massively at risk"". Association representatives allegedly conjured up congruent interests of apartment owners and tenants. ""Together"" you have to ""save as much energy as possible in the future, so that your own wallet can be protected as best as possible in view of the price increases,"" it said in a GdW statement."
2299	5	"It is primarily the tenants who are or will be affected by cost increases and literally cold feet. According to the GdW, the companies have ""adjusted upwards"" advance payments for additional costs ""in many cases in close consultation with the tenants"". The association, which represents not only cooperatives and municipal housing companies but also industry giants such as Vonovia, has “since the beginning of the crisis informed and advised companies to check the heating systems in residential buildings and adjust them optimally”. The lowering of the room temperature at night to 17 degrees Celsius announced by Vonovia on Thursday should give a foretaste of the ""optimal"" setting of the heating systems. The association had previously proposed that landlords should only be obliged to guarantee 18 degrees Celsius during the day and 16 degrees Celsius at night."
2299	7	"The expected interest rate development and the increase in construction costs together led to an increase in ""the necessary net cold rent from 10.62 euros to 16.87 euros per square meter"" in the new building, the GdW announced. If housing should remain affordable under these circumstances, companies ""could not finance housing construction and certainly not finance it through rent,"" said association leader Axel Gedaschko on Thursday. The construction of social housing must therefore be promoted with “five billion euros a year, financed by the federal and state governments”. On Thursday, Gedaschko called the targets set by the federal government for the construction of 400,000 apartments per year ""a waste of time""."
2299	9	"""One has to assume that the new building will become more expensive,"" said Lukas Siebenkotten, President of the German Tenants' Association (DMB), on Thursday in an interview with Junge Welt. However, an increase of around 60 percent predicted by the GdW would be “a pretty good pound”. In view of the current development, one is ""miles away"" from the goal of the federal government, especially from the construction of 100,000 publicly subsidized apartments. Most recently, there were only 23,000 new social housing units nationwide in 2020 - ""more than quadrupling this year would be very difficult to implement,"" said the DMB President. Instead of demanding further benefits and subsidies, ""the housing companies should go there themselves and develop building activities"". Because: ""We need a social housing construction offensive with cost control."""
2299	11	"According to information from the association, GdW companies had a good 691,000 apartments with rent or occupancy restrictions last year. That is almost 14,000 fewer apartments than in the previous year. The decline will continue this year. A ""much stronger state purchase of occupancy commitments"" is therefore necessary. The association is calling for the real estate transfer tax rate to be reduced to 3.5 percent, ""warm operating costs"" should be ""capped"" for tenants at 40 percent of the net cold rent. A so-called trust fund should ensure that rising energy costs are deducted from utility bills. According to the GdW, the withdrawal from the fund is “in trust by the company”."
