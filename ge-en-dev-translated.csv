22104	1	Industrial action against Amazon: The invisibles from the second row
22104	3	Reports on working conditions at Amazon quickly become reports from a disaster area in this country: Poor exploited pickers, packers and parcels home deliverers tell - mostly pixelated - about apps that constantly monitor you, about fixed-term contracts, about bosses with the upper hand , from being at the mercy, from the desire to find another job.
22104	5	What gets lost in such scandal reporting are the ongoing struggles against the circumstances. At best, these become publicly visible when there is a strike again at one of the large Amazon logistics centers, in Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig or in Brieselang, for example. There have been frequent strikes, several times a year, for almost ten years.
22104	7	The fight for a collective agreement against constantly increasing pressure is impressive, the perseverance of the employees is unique. Even if there is still no collective agreement, the perseverance has paid off for the employees: Higher wages and better working conditions are concessions from the group.
22104	9	Almost no reports are made of protests
22104	11	But what about those who come after the large logistics centers in the work process, which are further down in the hierarchy? For those of the last mile who work in the smaller distribution centers or bring hundreds of packages to the front door every day? There is resistance there too. However, he is largely invisible. Again and again parcel deliverers tell of colleagues who do not put up with everything from the subcontractors they are employed by. Recover the withheld wages on their own.
22104	13	There is collective resistance when the deliverers of a subcontractor go on spontaneous strike and unload the parcels in front of the Amazon warehouse in protest to draw attention to the fact that the subcontractor is not solely responsible, but also the group, which is Subcontractor system benefits. Such protests are almost never reported on - also because hardly anyone notices anything about such actions. In Wunstorf, Lower Saxony, there will now even be a works council in one of the small distribution centers. There, the Verdi list won six of the nine places in the works council election, also because the Verdi union recognized that it is not just the employees in the large logistics centers that need to be organized.
22104	15	Perhaps there will soon be less disaster reporting and more reporting of how human exploitation is being challenged by humans.
22106	1	CO₂ compensation does not solve the problem
22106	2	Traveling sustainably and fairly does not mean having to do without air travel. But it requires dealing with politics. How ethical travel succeeds
22106	4	More and more people are questioning their own role as tourists and want to make their holidays more environmentally and socially compatible. But traveling ethically – how does that even work? Jon Andrea Florin from fairunterwegs explains why you should take a close look at hotel websites and what questions you should ask yourself before traveling to authoritarian countries.
22106	6	ZEIT ONLINE: The pandemic, the flood disaster, Fridays for Future - the events of the last few years have also made us aware of the ecological footprints that we leave behind with our holidays. Have they also made us better travelers?
22106	8	Jon Andrea Florin: We don't know that yet, we don't have the data yet. But what we do know is that more and more people are saying they want to travel more sustainably. There are many polls about this. For Germany, there is a travel analysis by the research association Holidays and Travel. Every year, it asks Germans whether they want to travel more sustainably. For environmentally friendly travel, the values ​​increased from 42 to 47 percent from 2019 to 2022 and for socially responsible travel from 51 to 64 percent. That's a big leap.
22106	10	ZEIT ONLINE: Is the age of ethical tourism coming?
22106	12	Florin: I'm skeptical about that. Because on holiday you also want to take a break from the superego, to put it psychoanalytically. People want to take a vacation from moral concepts and conscience, to leave behind all external and internal constraints. That's why I don't think the vast majority will pay attention to ethical components and instead will continue to travel as before.
22106	14	ZEIT ONLINE: Cities popular with tourists like Barcelona have almost as many visitors as before the pandemic. The residents, plagued by overtourism, certainly imagined things differently. Is it still reasonable to go to Barcelona, ​​Venice or Paris?
22106	16	Florin: Yes, that's still justifiable. But you should note a few things. Let's take Venice: one should not stay in the center and only travel in the low season, which in Venice is from November to February. If you then go on vacation with the locals and let local guides show you historical places that you don't get to see on a standard city tour, then locals get a good income.
22106	18	ZEIT ONLINE: They need that too. Because they have to pay higher rents because the many Airbnbs are driving up prices and making their living space scarce.
22106	20	Florin: Travelers could look for offers on Fairbnb, which is an association of landlords who also live in their apartments themselves and only rent them out when they don't need them. Airbnb is a good example of how a beautiful idea can be perverted. In Paris, 60,000 apartments were rented via Airbnb before Corona. As a result, rents have risen to such an extent that Parisians themselves can no longer live there. As an Airbnb user, however, you can see very well whether someone is offering two or three apartments or just one, which they will probably use themselves. Then I think you can stay overnight there.
22106	22	ZEIT ONLINE: What about trips to dictatorships and autocracies?
22106	24	Florin: If the tourists stay away, that can contribute to people becoming impoverished and then even more so hiding behind an autocratic leader. In the Philippines, for example, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a dictator's son, was elected whose father was notorious for corruption and human rights violations. Tourism has collapsed completely because of Corona and that has exacerbated the economic crisis in the Philippines.
22106	26	ZEIT ONLINE: Which countries are taboo?
22106	28	Florin: Certainly North Korea, but I would also avoid Myanmar with a heavy heart. Because in these countries it will not be possible to come into contact with the people. At least none that is not directed by the regime. And of course Russia at the moment, although I have mixed feelings about it. If you know your way around there and go to people you know, to whom you want to show that there is another point of view, if you have the feeling that you can get that across, then I would not advise against traveling to Russia per se.
22106	30	ZEIT ONLINE: Another factor is the consumption of resources in tourism. A room in a 5-star hotel in Goa, India, uses 1,785 liters of water every day.
22106	32	Florin: There is a simple formula that you can use as a guide: the higher the number of stars at the hotel, the higher the consumption of resources. You can check the hotel's website to see what sustainability initiatives it has. If there is nothing there, you can assume that the operators are not concerned. If there's a little side note about sustainability, they might only change towels when asked.
22106	34	ZEIT ONLINE: On your website you write that there are more than a hundred sustainability labels in tourism. How can I recognize serious labels and greenwashing?
22106	36	Florin: The easiest way is to build on certificates. There are now some booking platforms that offer certified travel and accommodation. Fairweg and Ecohotels are new; Forum Anders Reisen and We are Elsewhere have existed for a long time. You can also consult the label guide on our website or visit Tourism Watch. Together we make recommendations as to which certificates we regard as reputable. The sustainability labels are awarded by independent, external certification companies.
22106	38	ZEIT ONLINE: In view of the fact that we contribute to climate change with every flight: Isn't the claim to want to travel ethically just psychological greenwashing of oneself?
22106	40	"Florence: Good question! No, definitely not. Because we always leave an ecological footprint, no matter what we do. And if I decide to only fly once every five years, then that is definitely better than nothing. We have created five criteria to look out for when travelling. We call this the LUCKY formula: G for leisurely travel, i.e. on foot, by bike or by train. l prefer local offers. Ü How to be ready for surprises and don't tick off the ""101 must-see places"". Lower C like CO₂ by flying less or by compensating for flying. And K like paying correct prices."
22106	42	ZEIT ONLINE: You mean distance yourself from cheap offers?
22106	44	Florin: Working conditions in tourism are often very difficult. Not just for low-cost airlines. On cruise ships too, many people work under the most miserable conditions for ten, twelve, 14 hours at a time in housekeeping or in the kitchen. Others find themselves in dire straits, such as the travel guides in the Himalayas. Tourists can see where they can get the cheapest deal on booking platforms and then book there. This leads to suppliers lowering prices. This creates a price spiral downwards and the guides can no longer live from their work.
22106	46	ZEIT ONLINE: Compensation is controversial among environmentalists. Is it more of a cure for flight shame than an effective measure?
22107	3	Coal-fired power plants are to replace many gas-fired power plants in Germany. The Bundestag gave the go-ahead on Thursday evening and then the Bundesrat on Friday morning. Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) explained in the state chamber that it was a “climate policy step backwards” that more coal-fired power plants would be used to generate electricity instead of gas. However, this is necessary in order to reduce gas consumption.
22107	5	"The background to the decision is the gas crisis caused by the economic war against Moscow. Germany and other European countries have had to cope with lower gas supplies from Russia for several weeks. Repair work on a gas turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is to blame, which cannot be completed due to western sanctions. According to the federal government on Friday, however, ""positive signals"" have now been received from the Canadian government that the turbine serviced there will be delivered by Siemens Energy for Nord Stream 1. From Monday, the pipeline will then be closed for maintenance for ten days. After that, gas deliveries to Europe will be increased again, Moscow assures."
22107	7	"Nevertheless, the federal government wants to become independent of Russian energy sources as quickly as possible. In addition to liquefied natural gas from Qatar and the USA, coal power is now to be used more intensively. That, however, contradicts the promises the Greens made before they came to power. A few months ago, Kathrin Henneberger probably could not have imagined that she would now have to explain in the Bundestag why her party is deciding on the comeback of the climate killer coal power. In her speech, the Green MP tried to sell the »Replacement Power Plant Availability Act« as a »great success«. With a view to a Colombian open-cast mine, which has been criticized for environmental and human rights standards and which supplies Germany with hard coal, Henneberger said: It will be ensured that the decision does not further promote the coal industry in Colombia. This will be ""controlled by parliament"". In addition, they want to ""drive that we enter into energy transition partnerships with these countries and manage the change together: out of hard coal and towards renewables,"" says Henneberger."
22107	9	"Ralph Lenkert, energy and climate policy spokesman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, explained in his speech that the left-wing faction would approve the law because the traffic light had improved its draft. Many people today are afraid of the next energy bill, continues Lenkert. ""Without natural gas, there is a risk of cold apartments, food - including bread - could become scarce."" Gas, electricity and heat must remain affordable, jobs and income of employees must be secured, said the left-wing politician."
22107	11	"Oliver Powalla, energy and climate officer at the Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND), warned Junge Welt on Friday that the tense situation on the energy markets should not be a license to mobilize and use additional fossil fuels. ""The federal government must react prudently to impending supply bottlenecks and ensure that coal-fired power plants are no longer operated by means of mandatory energy savings,"" said Powalla."
22107	13	"Whether Habeck's coal plan will work is an open question. The power plant operator Leag, for example, currently sees ""insurmountable hurdles"" for its lignite-fired power plant in Jänschwalde in Brandenburg, as a group spokesman told dpa on Friday. This is about emissions standards. Since these requirements for the power plant blocks could not be met in the necessary time in the security reserve, the federal government had to make an exception for lignite. ""If we're supposed to be available in the fall, we won't be able to do it without a special permit."""

22107	21	- Letter to the editor from online subscriber Dieter R. from Nuremberg (July 9, 2022 at 07:40 a.m.) Yes, in view of the economic and political shambles that have been caused, the green warmongers are now panicking and throwing all environmental ambitions overboard. However, the trigger for the “comeback of the climate killers” is not the Ukraine war, as the headline incorrectly states. Rather, the looming catastrophic effects are due to previous aggressive decisions and actions by Western decision-makers such as NATO eastward expansion, prevention of Nord Stream 2, extreme armament, arms deliveries to Ukraine and, of course, the self-destructive, blind sanctions orgies. Whoever wages the unspoken »total war« against Russia at all levels and with all means alone bears the blame for the foreseeable consequences. The Ukraine war is not a trigger but a consequence of the western strategy of confrontation.Answers

22108	3	"The attempt by the United States and its allies to bring Russia to its knees with sanctions on oil, gas and coal exports is ""pushing inflation to levels not seen in decades"". The facts are obvious. The quote is from a statement from the G7 summit that took place in Bavaria early last week. It is obvious that the leading politicians in the USA, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan do not locate the cause of the misery in their own politics, but in »Putin's war«."
22108	5	"At the meeting of the G7, which was a G8 including Russia from 1998 to 2014, it was decided to look for ways to control and cap oil prices through the formation of a consumer cartel. This is intended to reduce Russia's revenues in order to ""increase and keep the economic and political costs for President Putin and his regime high,"" as Chancellor Olaf Scholz put it. That will ""require a lot of work,"" said Scholz. After all, it is not only a question of the industrialized countries of the West having to agree – which they have not yet done – but also of persuading the big buyers of Russian oil, such as China and India, to follow this policy. To achieve this, the most favorable mix of threats and promises, punishments and rewards is discussed."
22108	7	In the previous discussions, technical means of coercion are in the foreground. Tanker transport requires, among other things, ship insurance and credit. The financial centers of the West still play a role in this. One idea is to tie both to the fact that a certain purchase price of the transported oil may not be exceeded. However, this requires precise knowledge of the contracts and thus also extensive willingness to cooperate on the part of Russia's customers.
22108	9	"If that were easy, the G7 wouldn't still have to talk about this four and a half months after the start of the war in Ukraine. Washington's Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said in early June that the US government was in ""extremely active"" discussions with European countries to find more ways to limit Russian oil revenues."
22108	11	With the same goals, the US and EU are also aiming to force the price of Russian natural gas down. So far, however, only the consequences for the economy and for the social situation of the majority of the population in the west have been negative and there are fears of catastrophic effects in winter.
22108	13	"Klaus Ernst from the Left Party, who chairs the Bundestag Committee on Climate Protection and Energy, therefore proposed in an interview with the Rheinische Post on Wednesday that the ""completely failed"" sanctions policy should be corrected and that the Nord Stream gas pipeline should be temporarily commissioned with Russia 2 to speak. He was then violently attacked by the party co-chairs Janine Wissler and Martin Schirdewan and by the co-group leader Dietmar Bartsch. But while the capitalists are at least discussing the advantages and disadvantages of possible measures intensively in their media, Ernst's opponents only refer dogmatically to their interpretation of the party congress resolution, instead of presenting factual arguments."
22108	15	The price of a barrel of Brent was just under US$112 at midday on Thursday. After briefly peaking at $139 in March, it has averaged between $100 and $115 for several weeks. That is still extraordinarily high: For the first half of the year, this results in an average price of 103.76 US dollars, compared to 70.68 in the previous year and 41.96 in the first corona year of 2020. To find an average price like the current one, you have to going back in 2013. The background is clear: there is no free capacity anywhere. These are very bad conditions for a customer cartel.

22110	1	part of state policy
22110	3	"The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, recently got caught up in a scandal over the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian version of fascism. Polish Defense Ministry head Mariusz Blaszczak last Wednesday called the ambassador, now recalled from Kyiv, a ""useful Kremlin idiot"" after the diplomat described Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera as ""Robin Hood"" and ""the personification of the freedom struggle."""
22110	5	"The German-Polish historian Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe had already reminded DW in May that »Bandera naturally wanted a Ukrainian state, but he wanted a fascist state, an authoritarian state, one in which he was the leader would have been"". However, Melnyk seems to get away with it this time too. At best, he'll get a promotion in Ukraine's foreign ministry, because after all, when one criticizes Ukrainian neo-Nazis and radical nationalists, there is little ideological basis for countering pro-Soviet sentiments."
22110	7	However, both Ukrainian politicians and Western allies often prefer to show off, since in this case it is difficult to conduct a consistent information policy. For if on the one hand there is a rehabilitation of fascism in Ukraine, then the formal justification for the Russian invasion is at least not without importance. On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians and officials themselves are giving away such trump cards, glorifying the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists with its military wing (OUN/UPA) and Bandera. This is not even a fringe phenomenon but has become part of state policy. Bandera's supporters parade through the capital Kyiv in a torchlight procession every year on his birthday. In 2016, the capital renamed Moskovsky Prospekt to Bandera Prospekt. On the positions of the Ukrainian troops, in addition to the national flags, the black and red UPA flags can be seen everywhere.
22110	9	However, the problem with rehabilitating fascism in its Ukrainian version is that you have to be hypocritical all the time. Even students and housewives are encouraged to be hypocrites, glossing over Bandera for liberal Western audiences but glorifying his deals for right-wing and nationalist audiences. You just have to identify the interlocutor first. Skillful use of such duplicity is said to help save the lives of the husbands and children of Ukrainian students and housewives drafted into the army.
22110	11	The logic here is this: condemnation of the OUN/UPA's crimes may lead to an uprising by neo-Nazis and nationalist paramilitaries amid hostilities - an undisguised glorification of reducing financial support from Western liberal society. Another manipulative instrument used to rehabilitate fascism is the reference to the »fight for the nation«. In Ukrainian national ideology, the concept of »Ukrainian« as a representative of an ethnic group has been replaced by the concept of »Ukrainian« as a supporter of radical nationalism since 2014. From this perspective, the fight against fascism becomes a fight against all Ukrainians as against one people.
22110	13	But western liberal politicians swallow that too and often refer to the figure of the president. However, Volodymyr Zelensky is a nominal and ephemeral figure, while the rehabilitation of Ukrainian fascism is a long-term policy more justified by external geopolitical interests. From the pragmatic point of view of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis, Zelensky only serves to disavow some of the thesis of Russian propaganda, which in turn contributes to the flow of money and arms to Ukraine for their long-term goals.
22110	15	And the fact that Russia is using the anti-fascist rhetoric of denazification for its own pragmatic purposes cannot justify defending or rehabilitating Ukrainian fascism and radical nationalism.

22116	1	The never-ending farce of US sanctions on Russia
22116	3	by Joseph Solis-Mullen - http://www.antikrieg.com
22116	5	"Rather than seek a diplomatic solution to the civil war in Ukraine that it helped start (by supporting the unconstitutional transfer of power in that country in 2014), the Biden administration did so in the months leading up to the Russian invasion eager for the imposition of ""extreme"" economic sanctions in February."
22116	7	The threat of such additional sanctions, as Washington had already imposed a number of sanctions in 2014, was supposedly intended to deter the invasion. When that failed, it was claimed that the sanctions would force Russia to the negotiating table.
22116	9	That too has clearly failed.
22116	11	Given the centrality of economic warfare to Washington's foreign policy, it is worth examining how the Kremlin has managed to keep Russia's economy afloat since invading Ukraine, what the wider ramifications may be, and how it might applied towards China in the future.
22116	13	First, the immediate collapse of the ruble was halted by the actions of the Central Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance. While the former doubled interest rates almost overnight, the latter began spending its accumulated reserves to offset price inflation, which was beginning to eat away at the purchasing power of Russian consumers. Although Washington and its vassal allies have withheld almost half of their foreign exchange reserves, the Moscow government has used its record balance of payments surplus to offset the temporary loss.
22116	15	This balance of payments surplus, the result of continued oil and gas sales at lower volumes but higher prices while imports fell sharply, has mitigated the impact of domestic inflation, which currently stands at around 17 percent, but did not prevent it economic growth in Russia fell drastically (a decline of around 10 percent is now expected for the coming year).
22116	17	As governments from Washington to London, Warsaw and Vilnius have made it clear that they do not support lifting sanctions even in the event of a cessation of hostilities, Russia's future growth is likely to lag far behind what it would otherwise have been. With Russia lacking access to Western capital and technology, it will become increasingly dependent on China, India or other developing economies for imports, but also for finding customers for its energy exports, as a much of Europe wants to drastically reduce or eliminate its dependency on Russian hydrocarbons.
22116	19	In the long term, therefore, there is little doubt that the current sanctions will weaken and impoverish Russia. Of course, just like now, the Russian people will bear the cost of the West's financial war - not its leadership.
22116	21	As usual, we are supposed to believe that the people of countries hit by US economic warfare will blame their own governments, not Washington - that they might even depose Vladimir Putin and welcome the West! Aside from the fact that this has never worked, from Cuba to Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, etc., Anne Williamson declared twenty years ago that if one consider that the last time Russia invited the west, the likes of Jeffrey Sachs, Larry Summers and Paul Rubin destroyed the economy and handed it over to oligarchs who they ultimately hoped would hand it over to western multinationals.
22116	23	Of course, the Russian people are not alone in their current impoverishment. Ordinary people around the world are also becoming poorer and weaker because of Washington's policies. As Europeans drain their savings in the face of record-high gas, oil and food prices, many in the developing world will literally starve long before the war in Ukraine is over - which, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, may be years away.
22116	25	That this policy has been hailed by Democrats and Republicans alike is not surprising: America's Democrats are delusional with hatred of Russia because they cannot accept Hillary Clinton's failure to defeat Donald Trump, while Republicans like Ted Cruz are committed to mercantilist interests are, d. H. US oil and natural gas producers looking to sell to Europe. In the first case, while Russia deliberately tried to interfere, it did not exert any demonstrable influence on the elections, which even the well-established Economist admits; in the second case, US gas and oil exports are already climbing to an all-time high.
22116	27	Demonstrating its ability to force others to comply with its policies and make its own people suffer the consequences, Washington has undoubtedly succeeded in getting the message it intended to send to Beijing about Taiwan. While Washington's arming of the global financial system has no doubt alarmed Chinese Communist Party planners, the fact that its own people would be willing to suffer for the reunification of their country and the fact that many countries in the developing world have avoided following the West's lead, there is ample reason to doubt the effectiveness of the looming sanctions as a deterrent in the event of another, major crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
22116	29	That doesn't stop Atlantic Council officials from dreaming about it ahead of a NATO summit focused on saber-rattling Beijing-bound.
22116	31	After all, what does a history of failure and mass impoverishment prove if not that next time will be different?
22116	33	If only Karl Marx had been right when he said, following Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Rather, the truth seems to be that if Washington continues to pursue proven failed and immoral policies, we are doomed to suffer a never-ending parade of farces.

22130	1	"The world's biggest sponsors of their own imperial power are demanding the ""decolonization"" of Russia"
22130	3	"Most recently on June 23, a US Congress-funded organization — the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission — hosted a virtual conference calling for the ""decolonization of Russia."" This raises the question of why decolonization of the United States has not long since been sought. After all, this nation was literally founded by successors of white colonists who first had to cross an ocean and then violently wrest this territory from the native people."
22130	5	"While the speakers at the conference, which can be heard here, took the current crisis in Ukraine as a starting point, they called on the Russian Federation to ""decolonize"" regions and republics that - like Siberia and Tatarstan - had been inhabited since the 16th century or – such as Chechnya – have been governed from Moscow since the early 19th century."
22130	7	"Such a demand would be tantamount to asking the US to give up all of its territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific, not to mention more recent annexations, such as Hawaii, which only became a full-fledged US state in 1959. When a conference attendee asked how the US should deal with the issue of Hawaii in the face of this ""decolonization of Russia"" debate, the panelists babbled around the question and soon changed the subject, ultimately just to prove that really didn't want to be that concerned with ""decolonization"" but is actually more interested in breaking the Russian Federation up into pieces."
22130	9	"Speakers at the conference focused heavily on ""Russia"" in the Soviet era, although the rest of the Soviet republics they mentioned were already part of Tsarist Russia long before the 1917 revolution. If anything, the USSR gave all these territories more independence than they ever had. Conjuring up the specter of the Soviet Union and confusing it with modern-day Russia is the standard ruse used to incite hysteria against Moscow as some sort of imperial power ostensibly trying to conquer the world."
22130	11	But such an attempt is doomed to fail from the start. Of course, as noted historians such as Eric Hobsbawm and Jean Bricmont have pointed out, the irony is that, apart from the Soviet Union, no other nation in the world has actively supported a Third World liberation struggle against colonialism. And certainly after the Second World War it was the USA that mercilessly campaigned for the preservation of western colonialism.
22130	13	"So if you look at cases like Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Palestine or Nicaragua, just to name a few examples, it was the USSR that supported each of these countries' national independence struggles, while the USA defended the ""old regimes"" militarily. The most notable case, of course, was South Africa and the South African frontline states, where the US and Israel were desperately trying to maintain apartheid and settler colonial rule, while the Soviet Union and its ally Cuba were fighting – and quite successfully so – to defeat those rulers ."
22130	15	Furthermore, it must be emphasized that it was the Soviet Union, more than any other nation, that led the fight against Nazi Germany's attempt to colonize Europe - and ultimately the rest of the world - in the 1940s. The USSR sacrificed 27 million people.
22130	17	"Meanwhile, since World War II, the United States has built an empire of unprecedented proportions. It is estimated that the United States operates approximately 800 formal military bases in 80 countries, a number that could exceed 1,000 when counting troops stationed at embassies, missions and so-called ""dormant"" bases and the approximately 138,000 abroad stationed soldiers. No other nation in the world has ever had, or today has, such a military reach. In fact, the relatively few other countries that have military bases abroad collectively have less than a tenth the number of US bases."
22130	19	In fact, only eleven other nations operate bases abroad, which together make up about 70. Russia has an estimated 26 to 40 bases in nine countries, mostly in former Soviet republics as well as Syria and Vietnam. Speaking of Syria, while speakers at the Helsinki Commission tried to claim that Russia is engaged in some sort of neo-colonial endeavor there, in reality it is the US that is appearing as an uninvited – and therefore illegal – invader in Syria, taking a third of the country against the the will of the Syrian government and regularly looting Syrian oil for themselves in this occupied country, in violation of the Geneva Conventions.
22130	21	Meanwhile, Washington continues to maintain its colonial hold on territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, Guantanamo Bay and Hawaii, not to mention that the entire area of ​​what is now the United States of America and Mexico is lands stolen from indigenous peoples.
22130	23	"In short, the US government and its compliant NGOs have no moral basis for ""decolonizing"" anyone before they have set about decolonizing their own territories."
22130	25	Such an effort could begin with the removal of US military bases around the world and the concomitant withdrawal of all US foreign troops, as well as the return of all stolen assets and resources to countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Russia, the return of Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, holding referendums in Puerto Rico and Hawaii on their independence, and paying wider reparations to Native Americans and the descendants of former slaves.
22130	27	"A focus on the sins of one's own country would not only be right, but also more promising and also avoids the risks associated with advocating the forced disintegration of other nations such as the Russian Federation - as the Helsinki Commission did in its loud appeal, which was at least implicit calls for a ""decolonization of Russia""."

22130	37	RT DE strives for a broad range of opinions. Guest posts and opinion pieces do not have to reflect the editor's point of view.
22137	1	Neither Russia nor the USA want a free Germany
22137	3	Many patriots in Germany, at least the majority who call themselves patriots, believe that the Russians are the good guys. This is not about the Ukraine conflict, but about the fact that the German people still think that the Russian army has retreated and left German soil. The propaganda for this has of course been successful since Central Germany was renamed East Germany, but the fact is that the real East or East Prussia is still Russian-occupied territory.
22137	5	The difference between the American occupation is only one, that the Germans were expelled and thus it is not visible to anyone at least in everyday life. So if, like many patriots, Russians are friends, why don't they give East Prussia back? Over 20,000 Russian soldiers are stationed in East Prussia. There are also over 60,000 American soldiers stationed in Germany. Neither the Americans nor the Russians want a free Germany, they always put their own interests first and these are not to make Germany strong again. But to keep it on the ground for their interests, because a free Germany would mean a free Europe and this should not happen.
22138	1	SPD MEP speaks out against bans on Russian media
22138	3	"In a guest article in the Frankfurter Rundschau, which appeared on Wednesday last week, SPD MEP Petra Kammerevert pleaded against EU bans on Russian media and for the protection of diversity of opinion and media. The EU would lose credibility if it used autocratic methods ""against Putin""."
22138	5	The current cause is the EU's new package of sanctions against Russia, which is currently being discussed. Among other measures, it includes the ban of three Russian television channels, the state-owned RTR Planeta and Rossija 24, as well as the Moscow regional channel TV Center. So far, these exclusively Russian-language channels have been received via cable, satellite and the Internet, at least in Germany.
22138	7	Kammerevert already doubts the EU's legal competence for the ban: The Commission bases its decision-making power on the contractually standardized competence to regulate economic relationships, but argues with the influence of the broadcasters on the formation of social opinion. This is contradictory in itself and reveals that the true motives for the ban are not of an economic nature.
22138	9	"However, the deputy also argues more fundamentally: You can only ""morally win"" against Putin if you do not sacrifice ""our freedoms for the purpose of supposedly protecting our society"". With the ban on Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, this is exactly what has already been done, writes Kammerevert. One cannot blame Putin for the ban on Deutsche Welle and do the same with Russian broadcasters."
22138	11	Whether the ban actually works is doubtful. With the help of VPNs, the RT live stream can still be accessed. Kammerevert further:
22138	13	The textual distribution of propaganda is still possible undisturbed, because texts are not subject to a license.
22138	15	"Kammerevert appealed to refrain from bans and to trust ""our diverse and independent media"" to ""unmask propaganda and disinformation"". Legal violations should be punished by the media regulators of the member states. She finds it worrying that it is left to ""big platforms"" to ""define fake news and disinformation with their terms and conditions"". Even beyond the individual case, the politician expresses concern about legislative initiatives that are aimed at ever further restrictions on freedom of opinion and freedom of the media:"
22138	17	Overall, freedom of the media in Europe is gradually being severely restricted and the old saying 'the opposite of good is well-intentioned' applies. What we need instead of further restrictions are effective instruments to defend media freedom and diversity.
22138	19	Among the German MEPs, the SPD MEPs were the only ones who had voted against the bans on RT and Sputnik by a majority in the European Parliament. While the deputies from the ranks of the CDU/CSU, the Alliance Greens and the FDP voted for the bans, the parliamentarians of the left and the AfD abstained in the vote in the European Parliament at the time.
22138	21	"More on the topic - ""Not fans of RT, but ..."" - Dutch journalists want to challenge RT ban in court"
22138	23	"By blocking RT, the EU aims to silence a critical, non-pro-Western source of information. And not only with regard to the Ukraine war. Access to our website has been made more difficult, several social media have blocked our accounts.

2214	1	Fear of civil war as a result of mass immigration.
2214	3	Former French intelligence chief Pierre Brochand warns that unless Europe and France radically change their policies on mass immigration, civil war could break out: “All multicultural societies are doomed.”
2214	5	Brochand, who was director of France's DGSE from 2002 to 2008, spoke in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.
2214	7	"""All 'multicultural' societies are doomed to more or less deep divisions,"" Brochand warned, adding: ""In such a situation, it happens that minorities are violent winners and majorities are peaceful losers."""
2214	9	"The negative effects of mass immigration on France can no longer be dismissed, because ""it is becoming increasingly difficult to prevent the French from seeing what they see"" and also because ""suddenly a pioneering figure in the formulaic world of politics that encouraged them to open their eyes,"" Brochand said."
2214	11	If Emmanuel Macron wins the presidential election and does not massively change his stance on immigration, a civil war could ensue, the ex-intelligence chief predicts.
2214	13	"""While this gradual upheaval of the French population is not the only challenge we face, it is the only one that directly threatens civil peace on our territory,"" Brochand said, warning that Muslim and non-European migrants are experiencing a ""spirit of... postcolonial revenge”."
2214	15	"He also warned that the significantly higher birth rate among migrants and the fact that younger generations of immigrants are ""even less integrated into French society than their parents"" are threatening the very fabric of French society."
2214	17	"The only solution, according to Brochand, is the ""remigration"" proposed by French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour. H. Incentives and obligations for millions of migrants to return to their home countries."
2214	19	"When asked if it was too late, Brochand replied, ""In any case, it's very late. Let's not kid ourselves: we are no longer dealing with scattered individuals, i.e. with many 'special cases' who are all looking for a better future, but with diasporas."""
2214	21	"“A diaspora is an entity made up of immigrants and their descendants, most notably French, who come together and whose numbers reach a critical mass sufficient to encourage, through social pressure, the maintenance of the beliefs and ways of life of the countries of origin, with whom relations remain strained,” explains Brochand. ""In this way, more or less closed foreign enclaves are formed spontaneously, turning their backs on the host country and its customs."""
2214	23	Brochand's conclusion is sobering and grim.
2214	25	All of my experiences lead me to foresee a dark, very dark future for our children and grandchildren. At best, they're heading for an unexpected collapse in their quality of life (an implosion), at worst, we're leading them into horrific confrontations (an explosion). Most likely there will be a combination of both amid growing confusion.
2214	27	As reported by RemixNews(link is external), Brochand made his comments amid another wave of migrant unrest sweeping through major French cities.
2214	29	As of last week, the cities of Sevran and Aulnay-sous-Bois in the Paris suburbs have been the scene of a veritable urban guerrilla war, and similar scenes have taken place in Villeurbanne and Vénissieux in the Lyon suburbs. Each time, incidents between police officers trying to enforce the law and violent, multiple-recidivist criminals have sparked riots, shootings, and several fires, ambushing the police squads called in to reinforce them.
2214	31	"A poll published by Harris last year found that a majority of French people are concerned that ""European, white and Christian populations are at risk of extinction"" as a result of ""Muslim immigration""."
22142	3	No petrol, no gas, power outages, horrendous prices: for months people in Sri Lanka have been taking to the streets because of the severe economic crisis. The country's president and prime minister have now announced their resignations. The US Secretary of State blames Russia for the crisis.
22142	5	"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed on Sunday that ""Russian aggression"" in Ukraine was partly to blame for the unrest in Sri Lanka. The island state has been shaken by a wave of protests for several months. Food and medicine shortages, fuel and gas shortages, and skyrocketing prices have pushed people onto the streets."
22142	7	The unrest escalated on Saturday as thousands of protesters stormed the president's residence, forcing him to flee. The Prime Minister's private residence was also stormed and eventually set on fire. Head of State Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced their resignations over the weekend. The island state south of India, with a population of around 22 million, is experiencing the worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1948. US Secretary of State Blinken told reporters in Bangkok:
22142	9	We see that the effects of Russian aggression are being felt everywhere. She may have contributed to the situation in Sri Lanka; we are concerned about the impact around the world.
22142	11	"He claimed that the world's ""growing food insecurity"" was ""significantly exacerbated by Russian aggression against Ukraine"". Blinken again urged Moscow to let 20 million tons of grain out of Ukrainian ports, which it says are being blocked by Russian forces as part of their military offensive in the eastern European country."
22142	13	"The US Secretary of State added that in Thailand, too, fertilizer prices have ""skyrocketed"" due to the alleged blockade."
22142	15	Russia, meanwhile, denies all allegations of blocking food exports. Moscow says it offers safe passage for cargo ships, but Ukraine prevents civilian ships from leaving ports, including Odessa. The sea mines laid by Kyiv are a threat to shipping in the area.
22142	17	"Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said some countries were trying to exploit the food safety issue ""in the worst possible way"", accusing Moscow of ""something it is not involved in"" and ""whitewashing"" Ukraine ""."
22142	19	Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in its history in May. Fuel rationing was introduced earlier in the month and armed police and soldiers were deployed at petrol stations. The crisis is being attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has deprived the island nation of important tourism revenues. Increased government spending, tax cuts and quantitative easing pushed up inflation.
22142	21	Around 100,000 people are said to have surrounded the Sri Lankan President's residence in the capital Colombo on Saturday. The politician had previously been brought to safety.
22143	3	Finally, the US-led military alliance called NATO has made clear its ambitions for a global cold war. At last, the warmongering organization has emerged from the treacherous hideout where it has been hiding for years. And therefore, from now on, may she be condemned by all sane people in the world.
22143	5	"At a summit in Madrid this week, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization released a new strategic concept calling Russia a ""direct threat"" and China a ""challenge"" to ""our values ​​and interests."" What exactly are these values ​​and interests? Warmongering and supremacy!"
22143	7	"The last time NATO released a strategic document was in 2010. At that time, Russia was referred to as a ""partner"" and China was not even mentioned."
22143	9	Over the past decade, the US-dominated military bloc has adopted increasingly hostile policies toward Russia and China. The search for a new Cold War was relentless, unyielding, and largely implicit. But now the US-led axis is openly declaring its hostility.
22143	11	The 30-member NATO has formally invited two new European countries, Finland and Sweden, to join its ranks. The two Nordic countries are thus ending their decades of nominal neutrality, which can only be seen as a calculated provocation to Russia's national security. The new members will double NATO's land border with Russia and reinforce the nuclear-armed alliance's already growing presence in the Arctic. Moscow has warned against such NATO expansion as a wanton destabilization of the strategic balance. The fact that the bloc is pursuing expansion shows a reckless disregard for efforts to ensure mutual security and the preservation of international peace.
22143	13	"This week's NATO summit has also made it clear that the US-led military axis is at loggerheads with China. Why else would an Atlantic organization invite, for the first time, four Pacific states that have increasingly aligned themselves with American anti-China rhetoric? The leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea were in Madrid to form the so-called ""Asia-Pacific Four"" (AP4). Like the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the AUKUS Pact, the Pacific is becoming a NATO battle zone against China, much like the Atlantic is dominated by NATO hostility to Russia. Ultimately, it is the United States and its imperial interests that are being served and providing direction. This is what is really meant by the vague and apparently benevolent invocation of ""our values ​​and interests""."
22143	15	"This escalation in 2022 is consistent with NATO's historic role. It was established in Washington in 1949 as an offensive tool for US aggression against the Soviet Union. American imperialism's zero-sum ideology is inevitably based on hegemony and domination. Other nations are either vassals or enemies. A multipolar world of mutual partnership is an anathema. In fact, the very concept of the United Nations is dreadful. The world must be divided into ""allies and enemies"" for US militaristic capitalism to survive."
22143	17	When the former Cold War with the Soviet Union ended in 1991 with the political and economic collapse of the Soviet Union, the initial euphoria about the supposed American victory quickly evaporated. Author and commentator John Rachel examines how the dizzying talk of an end to militarism and excessive military spending and the expectation of a massive, transformative “peace dividend” have been all too cruelly brushed aside. And why? Because the American rulers and their NATO vassals realized that without militarism and war, the game for their capitalist profiteering was over.
22143	19	Thus was born the Wolfowitz Doctrine and “full-spectrum dominance” with which the United States and its European vassals literally declared war on the planet to constrain natural resources and keep perceived competitors in check. A resurgent Russia and an emerging China would not be tolerated as obstacles to American hegemony.
22143	21	The past 30 years since the end of Cold War I have seen nothing short of an orgy of US-NATO warmongering, with weaker nation after weaker nation being destroyed by American-led militarism. International law and human rights have been eroded and plundered by a Washington-led blitzkrieg on the planet.
22143	23	Principled people like Julian Assange who exposed such crimes have been persecuted and tortured. Free speech and genuine independent critical thinking have been harassed and murdered.
22143	25	With incredible hypocrisy, arrogance and infatuation, US President Joe Biden and other NATO accomplices exalt the principles of democracy, rules-based order and international law. In truth, the United States and its NATO minions are the enemies of world peace. Martin Luther King made a similar statement almost 60 years ago. He was then assassinated by the US National Security State. Washington and its Western or Pacific accomplices are the greatest threat to whatever they supposedly and cynically uphold.
22143	27	The United States and its imperialist henchmen in NATO have been striving for a new Cold War for the past three decades. When the Russian Federation, led by President Vladimir Putin, challenged the unilateralism of the rogue state USA and its satraps with his landmark 2007 Munich speech, he was declared an enemy. Russia's military intervention in 2015 in support of Syria, which was being attacked by the US and NATO in a covert war for regime change, ended the orgy of American-led imperialist gangsterism. This spoilsport made Russia an enemy to contend with.
22143	29	"The 2014 Washington-NATO coup in Ukraine was another landmark event. It was a virtual extension of NATO to the borders of Russia with a Nazi spearhead. Could it be any more provocative? But Moscow drew the red line. Despite repeated calls for a diplomatic solution to Ukraine and NATO enlargement, Russia has been forced to take ""technical military measures"" to neutralize the threat posed by the Kiev regime."
22143	31	China, too, has boldly demonstrated that it is not willing to subordinate its independence to Washington's imperial rule. That's why Washington is abandoning its half-century-old one-China policy of its own accord, with the ulterior motive of angering Beijing. The provocation against Russia in the form of a NATO-armed Ukraine is the same coin as the provocation against China with a US-armed Taiwan and increasing NATO encirclement in the Asia-Pacific region.
22143	33	It is no exaggeration to say that this week's NATO summit was tantamount to a war planning conference. The US-led axis has created a new global cold war.
22143	35	That in itself is damnable. In a world beset by pandemics, disease, environmental degradation, poverty, hunger and unemployment, the capitalist powers are pouring billions into the war machine and fomenting a confrontational fever based on fear mongering, phobia and demonization. Their mentality is demonic. US-led imperialism has caused much of the world's current crises, including a new Cold War.
22143	37	Yet the world has changed dramatically since NATO was founded 73 years ago, or even since the end of the last Cold War some three decades ago. There is indeed a terrible danger of a catastrophic hot war. However, there is also a welcome danger that NATO will dig its own grave through its criminal activities and unfortunate contradictions. If Russia and China stand their ground, it could be enough to push the US axis into the grave it deserves.
22144	1	No more masochism exercises: Open up Nord Stream II!
22144	3	"The prevailing infantile policy under the direction of a small farmer and author of children's books is about to serve. It follows a government bard suspected of fascism, brings ""children's thoughts to power"", but ruins us instead of the targeted Mr. P. in Moscow. How naïve one can be, as a political Halma player, to want to hit the Russian chess grandmaster with tailor-made blockades that leave out exactly what we need and block exactly what his country needs - and also to assume that in the long run you will be in charge keeps and the other side parried at the word?"
22144	5	Politicians want to lay out the opponent according to the rules of the art in order to then hit him properly
22144	7	"Such political silliness has never existed at the state level in the history surveyed by the author. In this respect, the saying about the ""turn of the era"" hits the facts. As expected, the US-affiliated traffic light policy fails at the first half-broken gas turbine, which the Canadians - there you go! – should be released repaired so that they can be brought to Russia in an exceptional procedure. Of course, the transport is only released once for one's own turbine, all other sanctioned transports to and from Russia remain blocked. Greetings to Lithuania and the Russian corridor to Koenigsberg!"
22144	9	"Is Oskar Lafontaine right with his statement: ""Scholz is Putin's and also Biden's idiot""?"
22144	11	"The former SPD chairman and Federal Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine (here and here) could express what the majority in Germany thinks and, for example, hundreds of readers in the forum of a ""Welt"" article (here) almost unanimously confirm: This policy must go. It has frightened and harmed us enough already and bodes ill for the future."
22144	13	"Instead, all pressure must be exerted in the direction of stopping weapons and war in Ukraine and recognizing that the deeply hostile ethnic groups can hardly be peacefully united in one state. Especially not when everything is shot up with ever heavier weapons. At the same time, the supply of energy from Russia, including Nord Stream II, is to be restored – with the anti-Russian blockades being lifted. Fatal slogans like ""Never again energy from Russia"" and ""We will ruin Russia"" should seamlessly continue where they already belong - as Mr. Blinken's press spokeswoman, who ""comes from international law"" and has therefore internalized the right of the strongest."
22158	1	Study: Federal pressure on Paxlovid could accelerate COVID mutations
22158	3	Biden's FDA bypasses doctors to prescribe ineffective drugs
22158	5	The Pfizer drug used in the four-time vaccinated Dr. Anthony Fauci causing a relapse of symptoms when he contracted COVID-19 could help accelerate mutations in SARS-CoV-2 after FDA expands emergency use approval, according to a preprint study.
22158	7	Virology researchers at Innsbruck Medical University found little difference in the number of hospitalizations or deaths between placebo and Paxlovid recipients in an analysis of the Pfizer study, Just the News reported.
22158	9	"Marty Makary, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said the study clearly shows that overuse of Paxlovid in low-risk people can induce resistance and create new viral mutations, calling it a ""risky proposition""."
22158	11	Still, the FDA has authorized state-licensed pharmacists to bypass doctors by prescribing the drug directly.
22158	13	"The cardiologist Dr. Anish Koka of Philadelphia wrote in his newsletter this week that seven months after the drug's approval, ""it seems someone in government has decided that not enough Paxlovid is being prescribed."""
22158	15	"The doctor said he's been ""struggling with quite a few requests for Paxlovid lately"", mostly from ""young vaccinated patients"". Patients felt pressured to take the treatment and ""just wanted reassurance from a professional that it's okay not to take a drug."""
22158	17	"Koka said he received a ""panic call"" from an emergency room when a vaccinated and high-strung elderly patient developed a fever and chills after a round of Paxlovid he prescribed."
22158	19	"The doctor now regrets exposing his patient to ""the side effects of a drug with little to no benefit,"" while ""doing nothing"" seems to work better ""in the vast majority of cases."""
22158	21	Vice President Kamala Harris took the drug for her asymptomatic COVID infection this spring. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month he experienced a relapse of COVID symptoms after being treated with the drug.
22158	23	In May, the Centers for Disease Control issued a formal warning that treatment with Paxlovid could lead to a recurrence of COVID-19.
22158	25	Just the News asked the FDA how the expanded EUA might affect mutations, especially if the people most interested in taking the drug are already vaccinated and boosted.
22158	27	"FDA press secretary Chanapa Tantibanchachai referenced a memo from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Review arguing that the expansion allows for ""timely treatment"" for eligible patients since the drug is now ""abundantly"" available stands."
22158	29	"But the study shows that the emergence of resistance was ""inevitable,"" according to respiratory disease specialist Peter Wark of Australia's University of Newcastle and the Hunter Medical Research Institute."
22158	31	"University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad tweeted that Pfizer ""is going to make more than $20 billion from this drug and they still haven't come up with a positive randomized trial in vaccinated people."""
22158	33	"""Healthy 20-year-olds with no comorbidities and three shots are taking this product,"" he said."
22158	35	Prasad sees political motivation behind the push for Paxlovid.
22158	37	"""The concern, of course, is that it must be viewed as an offer for political rather than medical reasons,"" he wrote. “You have to limit the cases right at the time of the midterm elections."
22158	39	"""The other concern is that Pfizer obviously has an oversupply of products, and this move will help them sell that supply. Are they only working in Pfizer's best interest?”"
22168	1	Everything is collapsing in Germany - but the elites celebrate their festivals
22168	3	The elites party like there's no tomorrow. The most expensive and second largest parliament in the world says goodbye to the summer holidays and an eight-week break while everything in the country crashes. But Germany's political crème gave themselves to Lindner's decadent marriage on Sylt, where until recently, thanks to the same politicians mobilized with a 9-euro ticket, asocials and punks had been hanging around, and then the champagne edge. Some even floated in in a climate-appropriate private jet.
22168	5	All of this is happening while in the “last Germany of all times” the first collapses and crumbling are beginning to appear from cracks that have been visible for a long time. There is a shortage of specialists in all areas and increasingly also unqualified unskilled workers - because those who could work no longer want to or earn more money abroad, while Germany is becoming a paradise for all those who do not work. And with constantly rising energy prices, which are borne by the state, unlike in private households for recipients of basic security, Hartz IV status is increasingly becoming an insider tip and a luxury; not just for the refugees pouring in unchecked from all over the world.
22168	7	Parcel floor, counter clerks, cashiers, airport handlers, security people are missing. 100,000 truck drivers alone are needed. There is a shortage of teachers, police officers and accountants - although the state creates 120,000 new permanent positions for people with full pensions every year. Also to nurses, mainly thanks to a ludicrous institution-related vaccination requirement. Inflation is through the roof due to the irresistible and highly dangerous combination of money bloat and shortage of goods. In real terms, it should reach 12-15 percent this winter, and the trend is rising. Today we are economically closer to Sri Lanka than to the old Federal Republic.
22168	9	But the elites and their constituents don't get it. You don't hear the shot, not the gunfire, not the whole barrage. Empty supermarket shelves. Shut off gas supplies, looming blackouts. Fuel prices, which will tend to rise steeply again. Supply chains and missing spare parts. Our roads are dilapidated, almost all bridges are in need of renovation. The craft collapses. Public safety is eroding, swimming pools are becoming terror camps. There is no proper schooling. Families fall apart, clans triumph. And on top of that migration, family reunification, “repopulation” without control and without end.
22168	11	And they celebrate their summer festivals – before they make our lives even more difficult in winter with new corona harassment. Apparently this is all on purpose. (DM)
2217	1	Fridays for Future: Save Palestine for the climate!
2217	3	The image conveyed by the media of “Fridays for Future” as harmless Friday hoppers and truants does not correspond to reality. One could suspect that for a long time, but now it is becoming more and more apparent.
2217	5	Jumping and truancy for the climate: the harmless children next door – that is the media image of “Fridays for Future” (FFF). Clever observers had suspected for some time that this movement might not be quite so harmless in reality and that it might be pursuing an ideological agenda that goes far beyond “something with climate”.
2217	7	"Postcolonialism, ""anti-racism"" and other aberrations - these parts of FFF have become increasingly obvious in recent years, most recently with the discussion about the racist content of felt locks. Firmly part of the repertoire of the Friday Kids - at least their umbrella organization - is a die-hard hostility to Israel, as FFF has now demonstrated once again on its Twitter channel."
2217	9	"""Climate justice means justice for Palestine, solidarity with Palestinian organizers in Germany and around the world,"" it read in English on Friday. The background to this is the ban on assemblies that the Berlin police issued for pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the weekend on the occasion of the so-called Nakba Day (day of the founding of the State of Israel, which the Palestinians celebrate as a ""catastrophe"")."
2217	10	"These bans amounted to an ""act of repression"" that ""we"" - i.e. Fridays for Future - ""are appalled"". In another contribution, she made it unmistakably clear that the organization is not just concerned with protecting freedom of assembly in Germany, but that it is explicitly aiming at Israel."
2217	12	Israel problem known
2217	14	"In it, she referred to the death of Palestinian reporter Shirin Abu-Akle on the sidelines of an Israeli anti-terrorist operation on Wednesday. The cause of the death - whether it was Palestinian gunmen or an Israeli ricochet - is still under investigation, but that doesn't stop FFF from claiming that ""Abu-Akle was murdered (!) by the Israeli military""."
2217	16	"An Israel problem at FFF had already revealed itself several times in the past. In 2021, for example, the international umbrella organization had agitated against Israeli “settler colonialism and imperialism” and distributed Palestinian propaganda cards. The German offshoot and Luisa Neubauer had distanced themselves at the time and spoke of ""anti-Semitic content""."
2217	18	"Of course, the Neubauer troupe didn't want to give up the ""Fridays for Future"" label. Apart from that, it remains questionable whether FFF Germany even has its own people under control when it comes to positioning on Israel and anti-Semitism. For example, on Sunday Fridays for Future Mainz shared a call for a “demonstration on the anniversary of the Nakba”."
22172	3	Regensburg (dpo) - All clear for the global climate! Thorsten Kohnmüller from Regensburg has just remembered that it was sometimes very warm in the summer when he was young, and thus impressively refuted the research of thousands of climate researchers worldwide.
22172	5	"All this hysteria about global warming is completely ridiculous! When I was 13, it was already 36 degrees in summer, Kohnmüller explained on Wednesday, dismantling the central thesis of global climate research that had been proven for decades. ""Everyone had no heat that day and I was in the outdoor pool until the evening hours. I remember that very well. And what does Greta Thunberg say now??"""
22172	7	"He believes that the six hottest years since weather records began in descending order were 2020, 2016, 2019, 2015, 2017 and 2018. ""No, I'm quite sure that it must have been 1978. Or 1979. Anyway, I was really sweating then."""
22172	9	"In fact, it was so hot back then that he almost burned the soles of his feet on the asphalt in the parking lot in front of the lake, says Kohnmüller. ""The fine ladies and gentlemen climate researchers should explain to me how that could be. Climate change? No way! Chess and mate."""
22172	11	Kohnmüller's groundbreaking insight is a blessing for politics and business: Complex environmental protection measures can be discontinued worldwide, climate conferences no longer have to take place, and petrol will soon only cost 50 cents per liter.
2218	3	"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen became pathetic at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We are mobilizing all our economic power,"" she declared(link is external), ""Ukraine must win this war."""
2218	5	"Another ten billion euros in financial aid are to go to the country, which von der Leyen wants to ""help hand in hand"" to ""rise from the ashes"". She also considered stealing Russian assets: ""We should turn every stone for this - if possible also Russian assets that we have frozen."""
2218	7	They accuse Russia of using grain and energy as weapons; As an example of countries that would suffer from this, she cited Lebanon of all places, where the price of bread had risen by 70 percent. In this context, she did not mention that Lebanon is also the target of Western sanctions.
2218	9	"The EU Commission President also sees no contradiction to the plans to increase the proportion of ""green"" energy sources to 45 percent by 2030, thereby further reducing the need for Russian fossil fuels. The war in Ukraine is forcing the EU to accelerate the transformation of the European economy."
2218	11	After both the chemical and automotive industries had already declared that they could not produce under the conditions created by the sanctions, according to the Handelsblatt, the plans announced by the Commission were not well received by SMEs either. Its associations sent a letter to von der Leyen and demanded an end to the additional workload and more time for the necessary adjustments. In her opinion, the supply chain law and the introduction of a CO₂ border adjustment mechanism and various requirements for stricter obligations to provide evidence should be postponed.
22183	3	Nonetheless, no one should be mistaken in assuming that this development implies a transatlantic rift between the EU and the US, as nothing of the sort is afoot. Rather, the EU unexpectedly resisted the US after the latter had provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc by using Lithuania for this purpose.
22183	5	The European Commission's clarification that its anti-Russian sanctions should not be interpreted by Lithuania as a green light for a blockade of the Kaliningrad region strongly suggests that the bloc is concerned with the destabilizing influence that the US is said to have over the Baltic country. feels uncomfortable. Vilnius' unilateral interpretation of these earlier restrictions as a pretext for cutting off road and rail links with this Russian exclave was more of a Washington-orchestrated political provocation aimed at manipulating the minds of Westerners than an attempt to lower the living standards of the people in this region to deteriorate, as the author explained here at the time. The decision to join Brussels in this regard is therefore an unexpected defeat for this declining unipolar hegemon.
22183	7	The US successfully restored its hegemony over the EU under an anti-Russian pretense at the start of Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, even tricking its European vassals into counterproductively sanctioning its main supplier of raw materials, thereby triggering a totally avoidable economic crisis that tipped the euro to to par with the dollar for the first time in two decades. If some European companies were to go bankrupt anytime soon, their US and UK competitors would benefit. All in all, the US currently has almost total control of the EU, but they finally went too far when they got Lithuania to blockade Kaliningrad, provoking a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc.
22183	9	"That was too much for the ""Big Three"" (France, Germany and Italy), who quickly intervened through the European institutions to reassert their own, much more direct, hegemony over the Baltic country by making it clear that their sanctions were not can be exploited to prevent the transit of civilian products to the Russian exclave by rail. Although Lithuania is an American vassal state, it is more of a European state when push comes to shove, as has been the case recently. Vilnius could not oppose the European Commission, so it stuck to their political clarification and thus acted against the will of Washington. This happened only because the ""Big Three"" found it unacceptable to provoke Russia in such a brazen manner, which in turn speaks for their comparatively more pragmatic attitude towards the Ukraine conflict."
22183	11	"Nonetheless, no one should be mistaken in assuming that this development implies a transatlantic rift between the EU and the US, as nothing of the sort can be observed. Rather, the EU unexpectedly resisted the US after the latter had provoked a serious crisis between Russia and the bloc by using Lithuania for this purpose. This shows that America's top European vassals will accept just about anything their overlord asks of them, unless there is a risk that, in the worst case, it will trigger a direct conflict with Russia, as some feared that of the US orchestrated blockade of Lithuania against Kaliningrad threatened to do so. In such cases, the ""Big Three"" have demonstrated that they have the political will to act decisively against Washington's wishes."
22192	3	"Often referred to as a hate preacher and ""God's Kalashnikov,"" the man with the shaggy beard is the spiritual eminence of Russian war propaganda."
22192	5	"If Viktor Orbán hadn't recently prevented the Russian Orthodox Church's chief mufti from being put on the EU sanctions list, stricter measures against Moscow would probably have failed due to a Hungarian veto. Who is the man who makes no secret of his closeness to the Russian President and his war and even praises the dropping of cluster bombs as Christian charity in action? In the TITANIC interview, patriarch Kyrill, whose real name is ""Vladimir Heinz-Peter Gundjajew"", talks about his fondness for Swiss luxury watches, the effects of a possible ordeal against Putin and tells us which subtle and difficult to discover detail distinguishes him from historical crackpots like Iwan distinguishes from the terrible."
22192	7	"TITANIC: Your clergy, prior to your ordination, you were an active KGB agent for a long time. In the 1990s you made headlines as a ""tobacco metropolitan"" when the Orthodox Church imported cigarettes in bulk to Russia and you raked in billions selling butts. Doesn't such a history disqualify you for such an important and dignified office?"
22192	9	KYRILL: I must beg you! At the KGB, I learned from scratch everything I needed to hear confessions in terms of interrogation and torture techniques. And as for the fags: even after a few years, I still consider helping the Russians to stop ruining their livers drinking vodka and chain smoking instead as a service to people. I couldn't have known at the time that the ungrateful pack would simply do both.
22192	11	TITANIC: Already at the beginning of your career, as foreign representative of the Russian church, you denounced the 'postmodern arbitrariness' of the western world, which you accused of 'demonized euthanasia and abortions'. What exactly do you dislike about it?
22192	13	KYRILL: You know, active euthanasia is no stranger to me from my past with foreign intelligence. For people who suddenly no longer see any meaning in their lives because of the constant preoccupation with freedom of expression and basic democratic rights, a dash of Novichok can actually have a very liberating effect. And since you're talking about abortions, I ask you: In which Russia would we be living today if our mothers had aborted Putin, Lavrov and me instead of making good-hearted people out of us?
22192	15	TITANIC: We prefer not to answer that for health reasons. Changing the subject: According to the latest polls, just one percent of the Russian population considers you to be a morally relevant authority. That puts you behind even oil tycoons, nightclub owners and mafia godfathers. Even Ivan the Terrible would probably have better stats than you today. Isn't that devastating for a church leader?
22192	17	KYRILL: Of course, the way you say it sounds stupid. But you can also express it differently. Ninety-nine percent of Russians think I'm an absolute authority on immorality. I want someone to do that for me.
22192	19	TITANIC: You once had your $100,000 luxury Swiss watch retouched in an official photo. However, the graphic artists forgot to remove the reflection of the timepiece on the smooth tabletop, so that your weakness for filthy lucre became well known. That must have been pretty embarrassing for you...
22192	21	CYRILL: Embarrassing? I took over the 'Audemars Piquet in 18k rose gold case and platinum dial' from a man who could no longer bear the burden of wealth on his wrist and, by the way, for the same reasons also gave me his yacht, his Moscow penthouse apartment and the Ferrari fleet before permanently retiring to a Siberian gulag. To me, this disgusting wealth is a little like carrying the cross of Jesus to Calvary 24/7. Whoa, heavy! (moans)
22192	23	TITANIC: On the occasion of the Annunciation of Mary on March 25th, you always release a few doves of peace into the hazy Moscow sky in front of your official church. This year, for the first time, they didn't come back into the loft. What has become of the birds?
22192	25	KYRILL: They flew past the Kremlin, where a small military parade was being held. Comrade Putin just couldn't resist, the old rascal. But it didn't have to be surface-to-air missiles.
22192	27	TITANIC: In an interview you claimed that an invasion of the Ukraine was necessary to prevent gay parades from being held there. Quite apart from the fact that we cannot understand what bothers you about it. Isn't that a bit exaggerated as a reason for war?
22192	29	KYRILL: The problem is that things like this tend to come out in waves. It all starts with a gaudy parade through downtown Kiev and before you know it the Russian President is watching 'Brokeback Mountain' on DVD every night, our Secretary of State is welcoming Elton John and the Don Cossack Choir is dancing to the YMCA in Red Square.
22192	31	TITANIC: Gosh! But they know each other suspiciously well.
22192	33	KYRILL: (blushing and shifting in the chair nervously): Next question, please.
22192	35	"TITANIC: OK. In a letter, they wished Vladimir Putin ""strong health, peace of mind and abundant help from the Lord in his high and responsible service to the Russian people."" And if your supposedly anointed president is ""lightened when he shits"" - would you accept that as a sentence of God against a dictator and warmonger?"
22192	37	"KYRILL: As far as I know, the President only poops at home in a lightning-proof ""Faraday cage"" for fear of ordeal. That's why he always looks so grumpy at official appearances outside the Kremlin. If the Creator's wrath should overtake him with his pants pulled up, I would actually take that as a sign from heaven."
22192	39	TITANIC: Ah. For what?
22192	41	KYRILL: That I should also seize political power and become an ayatollah of Moscow.
22192	43	TITANIC: You're crazy. Well then, thank you for the interview.
22193	3	Nusa Dua (dpo) - At the G20 meeting in Bali, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made serious allegations against the West. While Russia itself had no intention of invading Ukraine, it was NATO that pulled Russian tanks and soldiers onto Ukrainian territory with a powerful super magnet in February.
22193	5	"There is no other explanation, Lavrov said indignantly while holding up a graphic with a large horseshoe-shaped magnet. ""Why on earth should a peaceful country like Russia invade Ukraine? It was NATO's nasty super magnet that pulled our military across the border against its will. The West is to blame."""
22193	7	"Since then, Russia has been trying everything in its power to leave Ukraine. ""But the magnet is just too powerful,"" Lavrov explained. ""Our tanks and rocket launchers are constantly firing only to drop ballast."""
22193	9	"The exact location of the super magnet is currently unknown. ""We suspect, however, that he is in Kyiv. You can see that from our previous troop movements. I call on NATO to switch off this super magnet immediately! This behavior endangers world peace!"""
22196	3	Berlin (dpo) - What's going on with the job market? Arnold Menschenschinder complains that his company, MiesBezahlteDrecksjobs GmbH, has great difficulty finding capable employees at almost all locations in Germany.
22196	5	"Unbelievable, why can't we find anyone? complains the entrepreneur. ""We pay exactly the minimum wage, offer inflexible working hours, unpaid overtime and a lack of opportunities for advancement, and yet hardly anyone wants to start with us. I'm puzzled."""
22196	7	"The situation is similar for friendly entrepreneurs such as the boss of the OHG who founds a works council will be mobbed out, the BoniNurAnVorstand AG and the company We-educate-nobody-and-are-then-surprised-about-the-lack-of-young-trainees & sons. ""They don't find anyone either. It's really like a bewitchment!"""
22198	3	Hamburg, Palma (dpo) - It was only a matter of time before staff shortages and congestion at German airports would lead to dangerous mistakes. At Hamburg Airport on Thursday, a pilot was accidentally loaded into the cargo hold of a Boeing along with his luggage and had to spend the entire flight there while a suitcase on wheels steered the machine to Mallorca.
22198	5	"Yes, well... Something has gotten totally mixed up there, admits a person in charge of the airport contritely. ""We can be really happy that everything went smoothly."""
22198	7	Exactly who botched it is still being determined. The only thing that is clear is that the pilot who was actually scheduled for the flight was not allowed past the security checkpoint to his machine, as is usually the case, but was picked up and loaded as luggage.
22198	9	When the Boeing 737 was finally ready to take off after a 40-minute delay, a trolley case that was actually intended for the hold was apparently on the pilot's seat.
22198	11	"That also struck me as odd, explains co-driver Peter Kahle. ""But I thought to myself that the airlines would know what they were doing and who they were assigning where. So I just let the trolley do its job. Most of the time the autopilot does most of it anyway. But of course I would have intervened if necessary."""
22198	13	"In fact, the flight to Palma de Mallorca was largely trouble-free. Only the usual announcements (""If you look out the window on the left now, you would see Mont Blanc if it weren't so cloudy."") were missed by some of the 140 passengers."
22198	15	"The landing was also described by some vacationers as ""a bit jerky""."
2224	3	Last December, 1,000 people in Austria, Flanders, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Hungary were questioned about asylum and immigration on behalf of the EU Group “Identity & Democracy”.
2224	5	Europeans pretty much agree
2224	7	Although the crucial question of whether Europeans generally want or reject immigration from other continents was not asked, all the other answers show that the EU and most of the member states are not doing what the public wants. Because this is clear: the majority has had enough of immigration.
2224	9	Only respondents from the Netherlands feel that their opinion on the immigration issue is taken into account. All other respondents do not see it that way, so they are aware of the fact that the government is acting against the will of the citizens.
2224	11	Hungarians and Austrians particularly critical
2224	13	The EU is planning, without ever having asked the citizens for their consent, to admit at least (!) 70 million immigrants to Europe in the next few years. Sure, because those affected reject it, as the survey shows.
2224	15	To the cryptic question of whether “Europe can collectively absorb the envisaged minimum of 70 million migrants over the next few years”, the majority answered unequivocally: no. After Hungarians, Austrians are the second least likely to believe that Europe “can do it” (two-thirds of respondents).
2224	17	Demand for a cost-benefit calculation
2224	19	"The answer to the suggestive question of whether one supports the ""relocation of migrants from other EU member states to their own country"" is answered unequivocally by those concerned: only Spain and Italy, which have so far very successfully passed on their illegal immigrants to the north , can imagine that. Everyone else doesn't."
2224	21	"All respondents are in favor of better border security, and all would like to know what ""public costs and/or economic gains from migration"" their country has experienced. An absolute majority of respondents from all countries believe that their government should limit immigration of people without professional qualifications."
2230	3	EU Council Presidency Reform backlog, debt, global sovereignty. Emmanuel Macron has many plans for the EU - but will he be able to implement them?
2230	5	"There is no denying Emmanuel Macron's desire to take risks. He indicates that he wants to fight with Europe and as a European for the next presidency. And that with the EU nihilism of nationalist, ultra-right opponent candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. All the more so does the Élysée see the Council Presidency that has just begun as an impetus to free a united Europe from its reform backlog and, if necessary, to brush against the grain. Macron also wants to persuade the heads of government of the other 26 member states to give the EU more global sovereignty. It is important to ensure that this union of states does not fall behind the USA, China and Russia in terms of ranking. ""We must come to a Europe that is strong in the world, free to choose and master of its own destiny,"" said the President. In his view, strategic weight is essential for the EU to emancipate itself from the USA and NATO, because that benefits its internal constitution."
2230	7	"Macron could hardly have escaped the fact that his country only leads the European Council, not the entire EU. In any case, with an agenda of self-empowerment, he will encounter resistance from staunch Atlanticists in Germany and unshakable friends of America in Eastern Europe. Since the Scholz government has devoted itself less to the imperial aura and more to the internal metamorphosis of the EU, conflicts with Paris are foreseeable. In their coalition agreement, they advocate a constituent convention dedicated to the ""further development of the European Union into a federal European state"". That sounds suspiciously like the ""finalization"" of integration that Green Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made a goal of in his speech at Berlin's Humboldt University on May 12, 2000. Even then, the alternative – federal state or confederation of states – was in the air. This was done when the constitutional treaty, which paved the way for final integration, failed in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. If Germany seriously wants to revive what was, the election campaigner Macron will have no choice but to mutate from a European to a Frenchman and to warn against going astray."
2230	9	France, perfect lobbyist
2230	11	For him, these are also taken with the European financial system. France has long been suspicious of the rigid Maastricht criteria for accepting debt from the euro states. It is now being argued that the necessary state investments for a more climate-friendly economy will only be made if budgets and finances are adjusted. It is ridiculous to stick to budget rules when the final climate collapse is imminent.
2233	3	"Once again, not only ""conspiracy theorists"" and reputable scientists are confirmed, who in countless studies confirm the extensive ineffectiveness of the corona vaccinations against virus transmission. Even independent media such as OUR CENTRAL EUROPE should be right, in contrast to the hacks in the mainstream media."
2233	4	It is clear that the government also knows this, because otherwise people would not be ordered to wear masks despite vaccinations and tests. In this article, we do not want to go into the other reasons why we are forced to wear masks, nor whether wearing a mask makes sense at all, if not even harmful under certain circumstances.
2233	6	Total failure of the vaccination campaigns can no longer be denied
2233	8	Let's turn to the comments of the head of Pfizer. In a video, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla expresses what can no longer be covered up: namely the obvious total failure of previous vaccination campaigns.
2233	10	At the same time, the development of a new vaccine is announced, which should offer every imaginable security: immunity with simultaneous effect against new variants and, to calm down, maximum protection against any disease progression. This jack of all trades vaccines should then replace conventional vaccines from April. Nobody can say at the moment whether this will work this time, or whether another flop will just flush billions into the coffers of the pharmaceutical lobby - not even the Pfizer boss. We guess no, because the terror of disciplining is supposed to continue and the pharmaceutical lobby will certainly not stop the permanent re-vaccination of its own accord.
2233	12	Until then, the now officially ineffective stuff, which was bought for billions and can no longer be got rid of, is to be “vaccinated” quickly. Otherwise, the billion-dollar fraud threatens to be exposed even more quickly.
2237	1	"The war did not fall from the sky! (I) - ""By the grace of God America won the Cold War!"""
2237	3	The people of Russia may be for or against Putin or the current war against Ukraine. They may be old communists or new rich, Soviet nostalgic, 'Westerner' or pan-Slavist. Skilled workers, professors, shop assistants, the unemployed or pensioners. They may live in the Black Earth Region, in the Volga Delta, Transbaikalia, Udmurtia, Yakutia or in the Komi Republic. One sentence drives them all crazy:
2237	5	"""The Soviet Union lost the Cold War!"""
2237	7	Indeed, the brash cheering triumphalism of certain Western circles has done much to put Russia and the West back in a second Cold War and extremely dangerous new arms race long before Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. And it is indicative of the mental and moral level of the people who utter this sentence so quickly that they are apparently only able to think in terms of victory and defeat! - But one after anonther.
2237	9	Provisional restraint
2237	11	When the Berlin Wall fell in autumn 1989 and the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe swept away the communist dictatorships, the US administration under George H.W. Bush back diplomatically. It was clear in Washington that any loud Western cheering would only have damaged the further course of events. Eventually, cataclysmic events such as a possible reunification of Germany were already on the horizon, and they were not to be jeopardized under any circumstances. Thus, initially, all demonstrative gestures that could have had a humiliating effect on the people of the Soviet Union were refrained from - while the 'Russian separatist' and later gravedigger of the country, Boris Yeltsin, was already promoted clandestin[1]! On November 21, 1990, George Bush senior, together with 31 other heads of state and government, signed the “Charter of Paris”, which in its central and epoch-making sentence: “Security is indivisible, and the security of each participating state is inseparably linked to that of all others ' broke with the rivalry of thought and action, with the potentially world-destroying politics of the superpowers' zero-sum game. This ended the Cold War.
2237	13	At least that's what the world thought.
2237	15	The coming out
2237	17	"But just a month after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bush - coincidentally during the election campaign - could no longer contain himself and on January 28, 1992 at the beginning of his annual 'State of the Union Address'[2] before Congress, he literally burst out out: The world has seen changes of truly biblical proportions in the past twelve months. Nothing less than communism itself died that year. And for a long time he, the President, had not had the opportunity ""to show the joy that was in my heart"" because he was so busy with these changes and all the progress. But, now everyone should prick up their ears! ""The biggest thing"" that has ever happened in his life and in the lives of others is this: ""By the grace of God America won the Cold War!"" (By the way: Dass he also held no less than God personally responsible for this stupid historical lie, which gives this remark a particularly embarrassing note.)"
2237	19	"No sentence has proven to be as fatal for Western-Russian relations as this one! This sentence already contains the seeds of the following American policy of unilateralism, the ""single world power"", NATO eastward expansion, the policy of regime change, aggressive wars contrary to international law, the termination of almost all disarmament and arms control treaties. And it proves that the man who said it, and all those who later parroted it thoughtlessly with proud chests and acted according to its logic, were apparently too mentally limited and morally too irresponsible to even grasp the decisive factor."
2237	21	Playful trust
2237	23	Without the revolutionary policies of the Soviet administration at the time, i.e. without the policies of New Thinking - then as now decades ahead of its time because it puts the interests of all of humanity above the deadly rivalry of the superpowers - the Cold War would never have ended peacefully! Mikhail Gorbachev, the architect of this revolutionary change in foreign and armament policy thinking and acting, puts it this way:
2237	25	“The end of the Cold War was our common victory. It came about through dialogue and negotiation on the most complex security and disarmament issues and through establishing bilateral relations. Without all of this, the Cold War and arms race could have continued for a few more decades. And who knows what that could have led to!”
2237	27	But unfortunately it didn't stop there.
2237	29	“Instead of acknowledging all this, the West declared itself the winner. The end of the Cold War - for him that was only completed with the end of the Soviet Union. American statesmen called this a policy of strength. And concluded from this that it was now necessary to further expand one's own military power, to enforce one's own will, to create a unipolar world, an American empire. Now the world had to watch as the trust capital accumulated in the 1980s was gambled away, as instead of a new, secure world order, the specter of a new chaos emerged in which the law of the strongest prevailed. On the other hand, the Charter of Paris, the ideas of collective security, the creation of a Security Council for Europe, which were seriously discussed in 1991, were forgotten.”
2237	31	Today we are standing in front of the ruins of this development.
2237	33	The Cold Warriors lost the Cold War
2237	35	Let's set things right once and for all. The first Cold War could be ended because the then Soviet administration around Mikhail Gorbachev had previously defeated nothing less than the logic of the arms race itself in thought and action! And this is exactly what made it possible for the West, which was initially reluctant, to completely scrap the most dangerous short- and medium-range weapons and force nuclear disarmament worldwide by 80 percent.
2237	37	"The Russians are still very aware of this. A little tip: Just go for a ride - yes, it's also possible now! – to Russia and ask the first Russian you come across. He'll tell you, ""We ended the Cold War!"""
2237	39	In a word: it was the Cold Warriors who lost the Cold War. And the rest of humanity won it!
2250	3	Data scientist and graduate student Emily Burns compiled a body of evidence she posted to Twitter that shows the ten most vaccinated states now have about 400 percent more cases compared to last year.
2250	5	While case rates were about the same between vaccinated and unvaccinated states over the past year at the precise time the shots were first introduced under Operation Warp Speed, things have changed since then.
2250	7	"Now that all that Fauci flu juice has had a chance to do its damage in the bodies of the ""fully vaccinated"" people, the ill effects of vaccination have never been clearer."
2250	9	"""If we look at 10 MOST VAXED states and 10 LEAST VAXED states, we see that when comparing the year % change, there is practically NO DIFFERENCE..."" Burns tweeted."
2250	11	"""Also that the 10 most vaped NOW have nearly 400% HIGHER cases than last year when the 10 Least vaped were up 'only' 112%."""
2250	13	"In other words, cases of the Fauci flu have increased dramatically since Donald ""Father of the Vaccine"" Trump's injections made it into the arms of tens of millions of Americans."
2250	15	"""The large difference (nearly 4x) b/n % increase in YoY cases b/n 10 most vaxed and 10 least vaxed can be explained by vaxe's negative efficacy (increased likelihood of infection) for Omicron,"" Burns added."
2250	21	"""Neg potency means more vax = more cases - what we're seeing."""
2250	22	Most vaccinated states also experience differential increases in deaths, while deaths in the least vaccinated states decrease
2250	24	In Ontario, Can. for example, negative efficacy of the vaccine is now reported after the first two doses. This means that people lose immunity after ingestion.
2250	25	States with the highest Covid vaccination rates also have the highest increases in omicron cases!
2250	27	"""Receiving 2 doses of COVID-19 vax does not protect against omicron infection at any time point,"" one study further found."
2250	29	Another serious concern is the recent divergence in mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated states. It turns out that the most vaccinated states are seeing a sudden spike in deaths, while deaths in the least vaccinated states are now declining.
2250	31	Burns goes on to explain that immunization rates in most states are 65 percent or higher in the age group. On average, 95-99 percent of this age group have received at least one dose.
2250	33	"""The diff between single vax and double vax in 65+ probably isn't due to some kind of late-burgeoning anti-vax sentiment,"" says Burns. “It's probably due to bad rxns. [Increased] spread means [increased] risks for these fragile people.”"
2250	35	"""Given repeated studies showing negative vax efficacy - immediately in the case of Omicron, the current push to confuse anyone, including children, who are not at risk and previously infected, the elderly who are two [sic] fragile, quite enough to endanger two cans.”"
2250	37	The situation is a mess to say the least - especially with jab mandates denting on every side. It is undeniably clear that the injections decrease health and increase sickness and death. The question is: will the masses ever finally object to this mass genocide?
2250	39	"""Omicron is an excuse to cover up vaccine damage,"" one commenter wrote of the situation."
2250	41	"""The Fraudci narrative is crumbling,"" wrote another."
2250	43	"""We're talking about a cold,"" someone else chimed in, presumably referring to Omicron. ""That's crazy!"""
2250	45	"""So the only thing the jab does is give you side effects for the rest of your life... snake oil!"" wrote another. ""That's why Pfizer and Moderna canceled the control groups."""
2252	3	Washington. It is an open declaration of bankruptcy by the supposedly “sole world power”: the White House now felt compelled to declare an energy emergency for the USA. In a press statement, US President Joe Biden announced on Monday that the electricity supply in the US could no longer be fully guaranteed. The president suggests that the war in Ukraine and climate change are to blame.
2252	5	"According to the information service provider Bloomberg, the blackout risk in Europe, parts of Asia and the USA has increased significantly from mid-June. The White House press release said: ""Several factors threaten the ability of the United States to provide sufficient power generation to meet anticipated customer demand. These factors include disruptions to energy markets caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.”"
2252	7	"The increased import of solar cells from Southeast Asia should now remedy the situation. The White House expects, according to the press release, ""that additions of solar capacity and batteries will account for more than half of the new capacity of the electric sector in 2022 and 2023."""
2257	3	"Apparently, our politicians have known for a long time what to think of the ""measures"". While passengers on the train have to reckon with reprimands if they refuse to wear a mask, politicians are apparently immune to any virus - and show themselves without a mask on the train."
2257	5	You don't have to go all the way to Sweden. A trip to the Netherlands is enough to rediscover that relaxed normality that we also enjoyed in this country before there was that crisis that German politicians in particular made it their task to exploit. With the Dutch neighbors, the only ones who let the fresh sea air filter their mouths and noses with mostly unhygienic masks are probably German tourists. And while in this country people keep their distance with a surly look when someone uncovered approaches, people in neighboring countries are friendly and relaxed. Not a trace of the panic pandemic that is still gripping public life in Germany, not just in doctor's offices or buses and trains.
2257	7	The German subject seems to have gotten used to the piece of cloth in front of his face. After all, spring is not only followed by summer, but also by autumn, which brings us a new, much more! A lot of! more dangerous virus threatens. At least that's what a health minister tells the citizens, who has been busy for years accelerating the conditions that threaten to overwhelm the health system with every flu outbreak: closing hospitals, reducing beds, scaring away nurses. The crisis being talked about is homemade, so it's better to blame it on a virus.
2257	9	"And the pressure has to be kept up. Otherwise you would have to admit that you were wrong. The virus was neither particularly deadly nor did the vaccines deliver what they promised. Rather the opposite. The supposedly life-saving “measures” often turned out to be more harmful than what they were intended to prevent. It's actually - amazing! - penetrated to the otherwise so government-loyal ""Spiegel"". Yes, indeed: not only does the vaccination not protect against infection, it also does not protect anyone from infecting others. And it seems to have massive side effects in many cases. All in all scandalous - and to this day not systematically cleared up. Doctors shy away from the not inconsiderable effort of passing on the suspicion of vaccination damage to the Paul Ehrlich Institute. But they may not do it because they fear they will be pilloried as “corona deniers”. Many of those affected are now resorting to self-help."
2257	11	The so-called pandemic deserves the name panic pandemic. But as such it seems to be as valuable as gold, and therefore it must not run out.
2257	12	"It looks as if our politicians have long known what to think of both the alleged pandemic and the ""measures"". While passengers on the train can expect to be rudely expelled from the train if they refuse to wear a mask, politicians are immune to any virus, they just can't tell anyone."
2257	14	They dutifully perform the ritual in the Bundestag or in the federal press conference of approaching the lectern with a mask, putting it down there and putting it on again for the short walk back. But then!
2257	16	Cem Özdemir studying files on the train – without a mask. And no, he wasn't secretly photographed, he published the photo himself on his Twitter account. Justin Trudeau in close conversation with fellow politicians, faces very close together, uncovered. The ex-Chancellor in an intimate conversation with her admirer, the mirror journalist Alexander Osang: without a mask. You understand each other a little better without it.
2257	18	And so on. Quod licet jovi, non licet bovi. Terrorizing the citizen and then repeatedly failing to comply with any of the supposedly essential life-saving measures is what is usually called double standards. The reactions of more and more people who were good mask wearers until then are corresponding. So far they have gone through everything, trusting in the right decisions of far-sighted politicians - who are now sticking their tongues out at them.
2257	20	Because they know more than their subjects? Because you have an idea of ​​how the report of the expert committee, in which the corona measures are to be evaluated, will turn out? It looks like not a single measure there will pass as effective - except, maybe, wearing a mask indoors. In this respect, Cem Özdemir is not off the hook.
2257	22	And that's why: let's just take him as a role model! Be like a Dutchman, be like Cem!
2264	3	The Russian President delivers his speech at the annual SPIEF economic forum in St. Petersburg. His speech is about the future of Russia and the rest of the world in the face of renewed pressure from Western sanctions against Moscow.
2264	5	"Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the unipolar world is at an end, although its beneficiaries are trying to preserve it at all costs. The President added that after the end of the Cold War, the US declared that its national interests were ""sacred"" and should not be undermined."
2264	7	"The so-called ""golden billion"" still think they are superior and see the rest of the world as their colonies. He added that the Western ruling elites live in a dream world and refuse to see the global changes."
2264	9	"""In recent decades, new powerful centers have formed on the planet [...] each of them develops its own political system and public institutions, implements its own models of economic growth and, of course, has the right to protect itself and the to ensure national sovereignty. We are talking about real processes here, about really revolutionary, tectonic changes in geopolitics, the world economy, technology, in the whole system of international relations""."
2264	11	Putin accused Western countries of deliberately undermining the foundations of the international order in order to gratify their geopolitical illusions. He pointed out that corporate reputations and confidence in currencies were being eroded by their actions. The President also pointed out that the US can steal money from an individual, group or state just because Washington doesn't approve of something.
2264	13	EU has lost sovereignty, harms own citizens with anti-Russia sanctions
2264	15	"The Russian president has criticized the European Union's decision to impose anti-Russia sanctions, calling it ""crazy"" and ""not well thought out"". Putin said the aim of the sanctions was to destroy Russia's economy in one fell swoop, but they failed to do so."
2264	17	"Instead, EU politicians have dealt their own economy a serious blow, which has led to high inflation, the President stressed. He estimated the cost of the ""sanctions madness"" at around $400 billion this year alone, noting that the measures are becoming a burden on citizens."
2264	19	The Russian President said the EU had lost its political sovereignty as its elites danced to another country's tune, even at the cost of harming their own European populations and business interests. Putin predicted that this would lead to a deepening of financial inequalities and social divisions in European societies. It is possible that this will eventually lead to a rise in radicalism and a change in elites in the bloc.
2264	21	"Putin added that global price hikes and energy problems are the direct result of failed US and EU policies. The President dismissed the terms ""Putin's tax"" and ""Putin's inflation"" used by Western politicians, particularly US President Joe Biden, to explain rising fuel and consumer prices. The Russian president claimed that only uneducated people would believe the fairy tales that Russia's actions in the Donbass are driving up prices."
2264	23	At the same time, Putin stressed that Western countries' forecasts about the bleak prospects for the Russian economy did not materialize.
2264	25	“It's clear why they ran this propaganda campaign, what all the talk about ruble-dollar exchange rates of 200 to 1 and the claims that our economy would collapse was all about. All of this was and is a means of information warfare, an attempt to psychologically pressure Russian society.”
2264	27	He stressed that despite sanctions, foreign pressure and Russia's strategy of substituting foreign imports with domestic production, the Russian economy will never become self-sufficient – ​​an isolated economy with no or only limited economic ties to other countries.
2264	29	To Ukraine
2264	31	The Russian President separately addressed Ukraine, where Moscow is currently conducting a special military operation. Putin promised that Russia would support Ukrainians in the areas under his control and give them the opportunity to decide their own fate, and that Moscow would respect this decision.
2264	33	He pointed out that military action is always a tragedy, but stressed that Moscow was forced to act. The president added that unlike US actions in Libya or Iraq, the Russian special operation is perfectly legitimate - a statement the West denies.
2264	35	Putin continued his criticism of the US, accusing it of building an anti-Russian base - something Washington would never tolerate in adjacent areas. The President went on to say that the White House should have pushed for new elections in Ukraine in 2014 instead of giving gifts to the opposition and backing the coup in February of that year.
2264	37	The President also commented on the course of Russian special operations. He explained that the decisions about attacks on the decision-making centers of Ukraine, especially on Kyiv, are made by the military commanders and not by him personally. He went on to say that Russian troops are avoiding storming the Ukrainian fortifications in Donetsk to avoid major casualties and instead are trying to encircle them. Putin added that Ukrainian forces holed up in these forts are using them to shell civilian areas of the Donetsk People's Republic.
2267	1	Are You Prepared for the Coming Food Disaster?
2267	3	"All over the world, experts and analysts are now warning of skyrocketing food prices and catastrophic food shortages. In mid-May 2022, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres declared that the world was facing years of famine and called on Russia to ""enable the safe export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports"" to alleviate the shortages."
2267	5	Officially, the global food shortage is blamed on “climate change”, the COVID pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But while all of these factors have played a part, other factors are also contributing to the stretching of our food system.
2267	7	Death by a thousand cuts
2267	9	At least 20 food processing plants went up in flames between January 2021 and April 2022, and a number of barn fires also affected farmers. While most of these fires have been traced to equipment or safety deficiencies, and fact-checkers insist that fires are common in these types of farms, there were only two such fires in 2019, and at least some of the barn fires in late 2021 were suspected to be arson.
2267	11	In 2020, wildfires also destroyed a number of farms, and in early 2022, outbreaks of bird flu in poultry resulted in the culling of millions of chickens, ducks and turkeys.
2267	13	"In March 2021, a giant container ship became bogged down in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking ""an artery of world trade,"" triggering a spike in oil prices and impacting shipping around the world."
2267	15	More recently, the United States has experienced an infant formula shortage triggered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shutting down one of the manufacturing plants that are part of the US infant formula monopoly.
2267	17	In response to the EU's decision to exclude seven of Russia's nine banks from the SWIFT system, Russia is also holding back fertilizer exports, and anyone who wants to buy Russian oil or gas has to pay in rubles.
2267	19	In addition to the fertilizer shortages and resulting price hikes triggered by Russia's export ban, Union Pacific (whose main investors include BlackRock) is also restricting fertilizer shipments by rail, causing delivery delays and higher prices. Also recently, a Canadian Pacific freight train carrying potash (an important fertilizer ingredient) derailed in Alberta, Canada.
2267	21	President Biden's decision to decouple the United States from energy independence by shutting down the Keystone pipeline, terminating offshore oil leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and freezing new federal oil and gas drilling leases and permits is also significant not helpful.
2268	3	United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has pointed to a lack of support for non-Ukrainian refugees. Syria, Afghanistan and several African countries also continue to need humanitarian aid, the UN official said.
2268	5	Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has expressed concern that increasing aid to Ukraine could undermine humanitarian assistance to other needy regions around the world. He explained this on Friday in an interview with the television station NHK.
2268	7	While supporting the active collection of aid for refugees and internally displaced people in Ukraine, Grandi expressed concern at the lack of support for people in similar situations in Afghanistan, Syria and other countries in need:
2268	9	"""These funds may have been diverted from relief funds destined for other countries. Existing problems in other regions are often ignored."""
2268	11	With a view to the global food problems, the UN Commissioner warned of a possible worsening of the situation on the African continent:
2268	13	"""Africa's precarious regions are not only affected by conflict and poverty, but also by climate change. When you add food shortages to this, it's no wonder that more and more people are being forced to leave."""
2268	15	The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported at the end of May that the number of refugees and internally displaced persons who were driven from their homes due to armed conflicts, violence and persecution exceeded the 100 million mark for the first time worldwide. The department said the number of forcibly displaced people in the world rose to 90 million at the end of 2021 due to new waves of violence or protracted conflicts in countries such as Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nigeria.
2269	3	In an Instagram video, the German icon of the climate movement jokes about possible terrorist attacks on the African oil pipeline EACOP. The project is intended to supply East Africa with energy.
2269	5	"And of course we're thinking about how we can blow up the pipeline.” Luisa Neubauer and a colleague laugh. These are scenes that raise the face of ""Fridays for Future"" on Instagram. Neubauer is in Copenhagen to protest against the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipe Line (EACOP). ""To blow up"" - that can of course also be interpreted as ""prevent"" to talk your way out."
2269	7	The bad joke has several dimensions. Because how clever it is, as one of the leading figures of climate extremism, to trumpet such ideas towards a radical audience, is an invitation in view of the attacks on everyday life that are actually taking place. Neubauer does the Böhmermann: what you think is said, then disguised as satire in order to be unassailable - although you actually mean what you say.
2269	9	The tone has become harsher since the coronavirus crisis stole the limelight and made demonstrations more difficult. Neubauer and Greta Thunberg are no longer as present as they used to be. Clear announcements are needed. Der Spiegel allowed the climate extremist Andreas Malm, who used the reach of the Hamburg magazine to call for violence in the name of his ideology. Neubauer's casual idea also fits in with the spirit of the times.
2269	11	The said pipeline is destined for the Third World. It is to pump oil from the Indian Ocean to Uganda, where a refinery is to supply the East African coast. Uganda is considered one of the poorest countries in the world. The construction of the pipeline will provide jobs for 15,000 people, and when it is completed the project is expected to offer 1,000 to 2,000 permanent jobs. Cheap energy should become a stepping stone for the region. The pipeline is considered the longest heated crude oil pipeline in the world.
2270	3	"Western anti-Russia policy is aimed at causing lasting damage to the Russian economy through sanctions and the refusal of further Russian energy imports. Federal Foreign Minister Baerbock (Greens) expressly stated in February that the aim of the measures was to ""ruin"" Russia."
2270	5	After around a hundred days of war in Ukraine, it is clear that the western sanctions are a real boomerang. Not only have they created acute energy shortages in the West, they have also made Russian oil and gas revenues spurt in more than ever before. According to a US government representative, Russian energy revenues are currently higher than just before the Ukraine war. US special envoy for energy security Amos Hochstein said at a hearing that this was because global price increases were offsetting the effects of Western sanctions restricting energy sales.
2275	3	Moscow (dpo) - Russia's economy is on the rocks, the ruble is in free fall, thousands of young soldiers are dead, international isolation: these are just some of the results of the war of aggression against Ukraine. Reason enough to ask the question: why does Vladimir Putin hate Russia so much that he is so willing to harm it?
2275	5	"All of Putin's behavior currently indicates that he wants to destroy Russia and the future of the people living there as sustainably as possible and for decades to come, explains psychologist and conflict researcher Bastian Fenten. ""It would be his job as president to make sure that the Russian people are doing well. Instead, he seems to hate it abysmal."""
2275	7	So what is behind Putin's hatred of Russia? Has Russia done anything bad to him in the past? Take away his lunch every day? run over his dog? Is Putin even a double agent of the West? Or is anti-Russian racism the reason why he lets his compatriots die and drives them into poverty?
2275	9	"The only thing that seems clear is that a spontaneous misjudgment of the situation cannot be the reason for Putin's actions. ""If that were the case, he could have ended the war immediately and withdrawn his troops. Instead, he seems to be intensifying his war effort and the atrocities that accompany it, making Russia's situation even worse,"" Fenten said."
2284	3	"Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau is behaving like a tyrant, like a dictator, Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes said at a press conference on Friday. ""He's acting like Ceausescu in Romania,"" he said."
2284	5	“If you cast doubt on vaccines, you will be ostracized. What is the difference between what he is doing now and what happened at the time of the Inquisition?” Terhes asked.
2284	7	"“On the one hand they say you shouldn't believe in God, but on the other hand they say you should believe in science. Science is not about belief, it is about measurements, conclusions, hypotheses and arguments. We are now at a point where if you have doubts, you get labeled,” said the MP. ""It's not OK."""
2284	9	"Terhes spoke to a number of Canadian truckers whom he thanked at the press conference. ""I hope this freedom movement spreads around the world because we need to make sure that all elected officials understand that they were elected to work for the people and not to behave like slave owners."""
2284	11	"Tesla boss Elon Musk had previously compared Trudeau to Hitler. He did so in a tweet that he later deleted. Musk posted a picture of Hitler with the caption, ""Don't compare me to Justin Trudeau. I had a budget."" The Government of Canada's Prime Minister has not presented a budget for 2019 and 2020."
2287	1	A failed growth model
2287	2	Associations and activists demonstrate against climate change, war and injustice on the sidelines of the G7 summit
2287	4	"Munich's Theresienwiese at lunchtime on Saturday: an activist disguised as a panda bear holds up a sign in front of the stage. ""Energy transition now even more so,"" reads it. Behind it, the globe floats as a balloon under the blue sky and »Save the climate!« is written on it. It is a broad alliance that has gathered here to protest. Attac is there as well as the Bund Naturschutz, Oxfam Germany, Greenpeace, Campact, Misereor and the Action Against Hunger. The appeals are aimed at the heads of state and government meeting at Schloss Elmau near Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of the G7 summit."
2287	6	"With a demonstration through downtown Munich, the alliance of 15 civil society organizations is calling for decisive action to be taken against the climate crisis and species extinction. ""We will take to the streets and keep fighting until we live in a climate-friendly world,"" said Lisa Göldner from Greenpeace at the opening rally."
2287	8	"The representatives of the youth organizations mobilize on stage under the motto »G7 – Justice can be done differently«. Beccy from the Bund Naturschutz BN-Jugend calls for system change instead of climate change. Ilayda from the WWF youth says: ""I'm afraid for our future"" and Luca from the nature conservation youth NaJu Bavaria says: ""We can't just talk, we have to act"". From the G7 meeting he demands responsibility for a ""binding agreement on climate and species protection"". Viviane Raddatz from the WFF asks: ""What are you doing to become faster in climate and species protection?"" The solutions are there, but are being implemented much too slowly. You need binding resolutions to get out of coal and gas."
2287	10	"In addition to climate change and species protection, the war in Ukraine is also a topic at the rally. ""Imperialism begins here: let's attack it,"" reads a black bloc banner. In the run-up to the G7 summit, there were arson attacks on police cars in Munich, from which the »Stop G7 Elmau« alliance distanced itself. ""End the war,"" reads another banner; ""Solidarity with the Ukrainian workers and popular masses"" on a poster."
2287	12	"Climate change and war were also the reasons why 29-year-old Max and his 27-year-old friend Hendrik came from Leipzig to Munich for the big demonstration. Max is studying to become a teacher and says: ""I thought we wouldn't have to deal with war anymore, now we're very close."" Developments in China and climate change also worry him a lot. And yes, he does believe that ""the demo will do something,"" you could see that with ""Fridays for Future."" The two also want to be present at the protests in Garmisch-Partenkirchen against the policies of the seven state leaders."
2287	14	The breadth of the alliance against the G7 make clear various statements in the run-up to the large demo. Elisabeth Waizenegger from the Working Group for Farmers and Dairy Farmers from Bavaria explains: »G7 states, finally say goodbye to your failed agricultural world market orientation! We need regional systems worldwide that offer women farmers prospects, feed everyone and protect the climate and biodiversity - with fair prices and fair access to land and seeds.«
2287	16	Roland Süss, member of the Attac coordination group, announces: »The G7 are backing a failed growth model that they are imposing on the rest of the world. The result is social division – worldwide. In order to solve the multiple crises globally, we need a multilateralism that goes beyond national logic and gives the Global South decisive influence.«
2287	18	Sven Hilbig from Bread for the World says: »The G7 share responsibility for many current crises and the ongoing exploitation of the Global South. We don't need the club culture of the industrialized nations, but a fair development policy and structural changes that are supported by the entire international community.« And Christine Margraf from the Bund Naturschutz in Bayern states: »Besides global warming, the extinction of species is the biggest global crisis on our planet. At their meeting, the G7 states must finally lay the foundation stone for a globally binding agreement on the conservation of biological diversity to be adopted before the end of this year.«
2287	20	According to the organizers, 6,000 people took part in the demonstration. At the G7 summit in Elmau seven years ago, there were 40,000 participants.
229	1	Cycling against Putin
229	3	There are many good reasons to cycle more often and not drive as often or as quickly. Everything is a gift and has been refined for decades. Recently, an extremely bad argument has been added: cycling or speeding up to 100 “against Putin”. Shortly before Easter, Robert Habeck issued the following slogan to the Funke media group: »Every kilometer not driven is a contribution to getting away more easily from Russian energy supplies. On top of that, we protect the climate.« (And, as chutzpah has to be, it »is easy on the wallet«.)
229	5	Neither of Habeck's arguments is correct. Firstly, you make yourself an idiot if you make a goal of the state the maxim of your own actions. Because those who cycle or dawdle “against Putin” are professing to be a self-confident cog in a great “national effort”. A contradiction. Secondly, the idea of ​​harming Putin with the petrol saved by cycling or dawdling is as dubious in its effectiveness as all acts of so-called consumer resistance. Even if millions followed it, it would be a typical ceteris paribus observation: the hoped-for effect would (perhaps) occur if nothing changed in the other framework conditions.
229	7	But do it, and do it from the side of those who are telling people this nonsense. The bicycle commuter has not the slightest influence on this. What a war like the one in Ukraine, including its prolongation by Western arms supplies, does to global CO2 emissions has not been attempted to be calculated with good reason. Because the answer is so obvious that the underlying question is ridiculous. War and climate are a topic that green climate and war friends like to avoid on a large scale.
2290	1	The fight for fundamental rights
2290	2	The criticism of Elon Musk's reach for Twitter shows that the much-quoted basic democratic values ​​are already partly history, at least in leading editorial offices
2290	4	Crazy: Someone announces that he will be in an influential position for freedom of speech and opinion on the Internet, and not only in Germany big media hit him. Moralism and self-righteousness have become so dominating discourse that a basic principle of democracy is being fired. This was also shown recently in the reports on Elon Musk's plans to take over Twitter and censor less there. One of the points of criticism was that the ideas of a rich white man in terms of freedom of expression are suspect in view of the degradation that minorities have to experience again and again online and offline. In addition, Musk is a big capitalist with who-knows-what plans.
2290	6	Anyone who rejects a takeover of Twitter by Musk for fear of the announced increase in freedom of speech has two blind spots. Firstly, this freedom is scandalously restricted on Twitter, secondly, the freedom of speech and opinion of our era is based on the capitalist impulse to level out traditional bondages.
2290	8	censorship scandals
2290	10	Anyone who has not yet criticized Twitter for its censorship measures has missed or forgotten important events on the platform. When it comes to the coronavirus, the curtailment of social discourse has only reached a new dimension. For example, some tweets that questioned the benefits of corona vaccinations claimed by governments or spoke of vaccine damage could not be disseminated, not even answered - even if they linked to a scientific study or a government statement, or even contained a simple question.
2290	12	The social network Facebook has even been publicly addressed by the renowned specialist magazine British Medical Journal since January. From the beginning, the magazine had published critical articles about the significance of the approval studies for the corona vaccines by Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna, and one of them was posted on Facebook with a warning and the threat that anyone who repeatedly linked something like this ran the risk of being blocked will. In November 2021, Facebook's sister platform Instagram blocked mention of the profile of the scientific Cochrane network, which enjoys a worldwide reputation for setting standards for the evaluation of medical studies. The reasoning was that Cochrane had “repeatedly published content that violates guidelines on false content about COVID-19 or vaccinations”. All of these censorship measures are anti-scientific.
2290	14	Social media as a political issue
2290	16	The suspicion is that Twitter and Facebook are sabotaging criticism of the suspension of fundamental rights over the past two years because they are benefiting from the officially prescribed online communication. But the censorship problem also exists independently of this. For example, three weeks before the last presidential election in the USA in 2020, both platforms prevented the distribution of the link to an article in the New York Post newspaper. Based on old e-mails from Hunter Biden, son of current President Joe Biden, he suggested that Hunter had only been given a lucrative post at a Ukrainian energy company so that his father, then US Vice President, would join the company by the Ukrainian government - which Joe Biden then did, whether intentionally or not. More than a month later, after the presidential election, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey described this censorship as a mistake. His platform had deactivated the New York Post profile for two weeks. In 2019, Twitter censorship was even an issue in the German Bundestag. In the run-up to the European Parliament elections, the platform had published guidelines against political misinformation and then blocked tweets without rhyme or reason. Here, among others, SPD politicians and the newspaper »Jüdische Allgemeine« were affected.
2290	18	Elon Musk's criticism of censorship on Twitter is therefore absolutely necessary. On the other hand, it is out of place to criticize his ideas of (free) speech as an expression of a capitalist mentality. Due to the equality of all of us before money and goods, capitalism has laid the basis for the modern understanding of fundamental rights. Liberalism is the associated body of thought, which, however, has become independent of its capitalist basis and made possible a generalization of basic rights. It has developed a life of its own, as happens again and again with political ideas. And it is often useful against existing bondages.
2291	3	Now the way is clear: Finland and Sweden will soon be members of NATO. But what exactly does that actually mean? And what does that have to do with Russia? Oh god, please don't ask such a stupid question, we'll explain it to you in detail! Here are the most important questions and answers about Finland and Sweden joining NATO:
2291	5	Where are Finland and Sweden?
2291	7	"Finland and Sweden are in northern Europe or, as geographers say, ""at the top of the map"". They're located on either side of the Gulf of Bothnia, putting them right in the European epicenter of salacious geographic puns."
2291	9	What is NATO?
2291	11	NATO (abbreviation for North AtlaNtic TreATy OrganizatiOn) is a purely defensive (with no more than provoking, spitting and pinching) alliance that was originally created as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO had no equal opponent for a long time and therefore concentrated on minor robbery and extortion crimes before an interesting despot finally reappeared in Vladimir Putin.
2291	13	And what is the OTAN?
2291	15	An extra sausage for the French, who like to pronounce abbreviations backwards (cf. ASU, FECINU, UE, GfM, BACA).
2291	17	Why weren't Sweden and Finland in NATO until now?
2291	19	For fear of Russia.
2291	21	Why do Sweden and Finland suddenly want to join NATO?
2291	23	For fear of Russia.
2291	25	What is the military performance of the two countries?
2291	27	Finland and Sweden each have a strong army. Particularly feared are the Swedish Elk Hussars (troop strength: 50,000) and Matti Hämäläinen from Helsinki, who is just a pretty scary guy.
2291	29	Can I also become a NATO member? How much is it?
2291	31	In theory, anyone can become a member of NATO as long as they don't live too far from the North Atlantic and promise to invest 2 percent of their salary in weapons. However, accession forms are only available at the NATO headquarters in Brussels.
2291	33	How does the admission of Sweden and Finland work?
2291	35	After all NATO members have agreed, the two new members only have to undergo the traditional, somewhat archaic initiation ritual. It stipulates that Sweden and Finland must run naked and blindfolded past all previous member states while they hit their behinds with paddles.
2291	37	What did Erdogan get for his approval?
2291	39	The admission of the two candidates had previously failed for weeks because of him: Recep Erdogan. According to reports, the Turkish president paid dearly for his current approval: Finland and Sweden have to massage his feet twice a week, serve snacks and drinks on demand and, like the rest of NATO, kindly shut up when Turkey bombs the Kurds again .
2291	41	What Erdogan hasn't considered, however, is that as soon as Sweden and Finland are in NATO, they can withdraw all concessions. Because once you're in NATO, you can't be thrown out. But shhh! – Erdogan is not allowed to know that now, of course.
2291	43	exceptionally. But only this once.
2291	45	Can the answer be at the top and the question at the bottom in this FAQ article?
2291	47	Why are Sweden and Finland allowed into NATO, but not Ukraine?
2291	49	There are two important reasons for this. For one thing, Sweden and Finland do not have a large enough Russian minority to goad Russia into a separatist state and then rush to its aid. On the other hand, Russia cannot currently attack Sweden and Finland because it is far too busy bombing Ukraine because it wanted to join NATO.
2291	51	How is Russia reacting to the candidacy of the two countries?
2291	53	"Due to the ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Russia is currently far too busy to respond adequately to this affront. However, Finland and Sweden each received a nuclear destruction and general destruction voucher to redeem from 2025."
2294	1	Prudery instead of Pride
2294	3	Once the largest queer parade in Southeast Europe, now a symbol of repression. As in previous years, Istanbul Pride Week was banned. It was supposed to take place from June 20th to 26th, with a colorful program consisting of lectures, discussions and speed dating events, ending with a big parade on Sunday.
2294	5	"The governors of Istanbul's Kadikoy and Beyoglu districts said that after police inspections of the venues for the 30th annual Pride Week, they decided not to allow events on the streets or in buildings. ""All events are banned in all open and closed areas for seven days,"" the governor's offices said in a statement. The ban was justified with the prevention of crime and the maintenance of peace and security. ""After the Taksim Gezi Park protests in 2013, we all decided that 'resistance' should be the theme of Pride Week,"" Es Yılmaz, a spokeswoman for the Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee, told Junge Welt on Wednesday."
2294	7	"The people who want to celebrate the LGBTI+ Pride Week are not only exposed to state repression and attacks by the police, religious fanatical groups are also mobilizing against them. The group Müdafaa-i İslam Hareketi (Movement for the Defense of Islam) called for a gathering in Taksim at 2:53 p.m. this Sunday, the day of the Pride parade. ""Protect your family, generation and city."" ""Say stop to perversion!"" the group wrote in a message on the short message service Twitter on Monday, which was commented on with numerous death threats against LGBTI+ people."
2294	9	After a large Pride parade with more than 100,000 participants in 2014, the Turkish authorities had always prohibited the move in recent years - officially for security reasons. »Pride Week 2014 was the largest LGBTI+ event in Turkey's history, attracting more than 100,000 people. In 2015, the Pride events were banned and our marches were blocked by the police,” Yilmaz complained to jW. Hundreds of people defied the ban and were attacked by the police with tear gas, protective shields, pepper gas and plastic bullets.
2294	11	"The repressive, right-wing conservative spirit of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Ankara is also spreading in the 15-million metropolis of Istanbul. ""You are responsible for all the violence we are experiencing,"" Yilmaz said in a jW interview. ""LGBTI+, that doesn't exist,"" said the Turkish President. Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu called homosexuals ""perverts,"" ""a senior health official compared us to pedophiles, and the top imam warned that we spread diseases,"" Yilmaz said. The government has arrested thousands of Kurdish politicians, human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists. »The Turkish government is also targeting LGBTI+ communities, but we refuse to back down.«"
2294	13	The İstanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week Committee issued a statement on social media following Tuesday's ban decision. “The law enforcement officers tried to put pressure on the venues by demanding documents such as tax plates and signs for the venues where the event would be held. Despite the pressure, we met today at our venues.” The committee said the ban was unlawful and it would “use all rights and appeal as necessary.”

2296	1	sexism in politics
2296	3	"The upper house election planned for July 10 in Japan is sometimes referred to as a ""fateful election"" - half of the members of the house are alternately determined every three years. The reason for this are the plans of the right to lay hands on the peace constitution with a two-thirds majority. The hopes of pacifists are now increasingly pinned on the women among the »centre-left« candidates. In last Saturday's edition, the left-liberal daily Nikkan Gendai hoped for a ""hurricane of the Madonnas"" to prevent the right-wing forces in the upper house from achieving the two-thirds majority needed for a constitutional amendment."
2296	5	In fact, this time there were more female candidates than ever before: 181, which corresponds to 33 percent of all candidates. For conservative Japan, these are extremely high numbers when you consider that in the lower house, which is endowed with more money, just under ten percent of the deputies are women. This puts Japan in 165th place out of 188 countries.
2296	7	Up until the 2009 general election, the proportion of women in parliament rose steadily before it began to stagnate. Many Japanese still believe that women belong at the stove and that the heavy workload of a politician keeps them from family responsibilities. In addition, a subtle sexism pervades society, which does not stop at politics.
2296	9	A good example is the case of Ayaka Shiomura in 2014. The then Tokyo MP was speaking at a plenary session about the need to provide better support for women with children in order to increase the birth rate when a colleague from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) shouted at her: »You should get married yourself.” Other heckling from men followed.
2296	11	"Investigations revealed that the incident was just the tip of the iceberg. Sexist remarks by politicians are the rule rather than the exception. In early June, Nikkan Gendai reported that a lawmaker from the right-wing Japan Innovation Party introduced a female candidate by saying, ""If you took the beauty of her face as a yardstick, she would be number one."" to play only the role of an appendage of the male ranks in right-wing parties. It is also significant that the parties like to recruit Japanese women who have become known through television or sports. The focus is not on the person, but on image cultivation."
2296	13	"""Last but not least, the election campaign is an obstacle to a woman's political career,"" Shiomura, who has been a member of the upper house for the left-liberal KDP for three years, told jW on June 14. This year it lasts around two and a half weeks: the candidates stand in squares and in front of train stations from morning to evening with temperatures of up to 40 degrees and try to attract the attention of passers-by with fiery speeches. Women in particular go to the limits of their resilience: Three years ago they suffered from a dizzy spell three times and twice their voice failed, Shiomura complained."
2296	15	"""And if women still make it into parliament, they have to struggle with male bureaucracy,"" the politician continued. Parliament is run by men, they decide who is allowed to speak when and on which topics. Nonetheless, Shiomura, who entered politics through animal welfare issues, has been able to make a difference in some areas such as fertility treatment and abortion."
2296	17	Only the next general elections will show whether this time the increase in the proportion of women among the candidates by around five percentage points compared to 2019 marks the beginning of a new trend. At least in the case of the LDP, however, there has not yet been a rethink: at 23 percent, their quota of female candidates is disappointing.
