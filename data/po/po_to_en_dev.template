25106	1	Only with us: Greta Thunberg with a climate crisis
25106	3	Earth Day: Greta Thunberg with a climate crisis
25106	5	In a passionate letter, 18-year-old Swedish explains why world leaders must take more radical action to prevent a disaster.
25106	7	Greta Thunberg was only 15 years old, when in August 2018 she began weekly protests in front of the Swedish Parliament building in Stockholm. She couldn't understand why nobody was talking about the big problem the climate crisis was. Since then, the 18-year-old activist has mobilized millions of people to go to the streets, and she became one of the most recognizable faces of the environment for the environmental defense in the world.
25106	9	On Earth Day, April 22, 2021, during the climate summit organized by the President of the United States Joe Biden, the leader of the countries participating in it will present new commitments in the matter of counteracting the climate crisis, including the project to achieve zero -emission by 2050. They will call them ambitious projects. When we compare what the latest scientific achievements offer us, with so -called climate goals, we will see a serious gap - where you really have to act, we have a delay of decades.
25106	11	Of course, all activities should be supported to provide us with a safe future and protect against deterioration of living conditions. The goals presented at the top could be a great starting point, were it not for a small detail - they are full of gaps and legal tricks. Such as omitting emissions resulting from the import of goods, aviation and international transport and biomass combustion. They enable manipulation of the starting data, excluding feedback and critical points, ignoring the key aspect, which is a fair division and historical participation in emissions. For this reason, these goals depend entirely on abstract calculations and virtually inaccessible technologies. I don't have time to go into details now.
25106	13	The thing is that we can continue to use creative accounting regarding carbon dioxide emissions and cheat in our calculations to pretend that the set goals are what we need now. However, we must not forget that although cheating on others and even ourselves is possible, nature and physics cannot be fooled. It doesn't matter if we conduct calculations honestly or not, emissions are a fact.
25106	15	People exercising power are not attached to be responsible, because the awareness of this issue is still small. This is where the heart is the heart of the problem. If you call their obligations "brave" or "ambitious", you do not fully understand how serious we found ourselves.
25106	17	I met with many world leaders. Even they themselves admit that the goals they designate do not correspond to the obligations they undertaken. It's completely natural. They only do what they consider to be done in connection with the political situation. Their task is to fulfill the wishes of voters, and if voters do not demand real actions to stop the climate disaster, it is obvious that nothing will change. Fortunately, this is how democracy works. It is public opinion that rules the free world. If we want to change, we must increase social awareness and show that what seems impossible may become possible.
25106	19	We understand that the world is complicated, that many people do what they can, and what we need is not easy. Of course, even insufficient goals are better than nothing. However, we cannot be satisfied with something just because it is better than nothing. We have to do more. We must believe that we are able to do it - and we are really. If we unite and set a specific goal, impossible things will cease to exist.
25106	21	I'm not ready to give up
25106	23	World leaders confess to the surrender towards the goal 1.5 ° C. They give up their promises and our future. I don't know how you, but I know I'm not ready to give up. I will never give up. We will fight for a safe future. Even a fraction of the degree is important, it will always matter.
25106	25	You can say that we are naive, believing that change is possible. All right. But at least we are not naive enough to think that our problems will be solved by countries and companies setting general, distant and insufficient goals if they do not meet with pressure from the media and public opinion.
25106	27	The gap between what you need to do and what we really do is getting bigger by minute. The gap between the necessary actions and the level of awareness and attention devoted to the problem is becoming more and more absurd. And the gap between the so -called climate goals and currently available scientific solutions should cease to be ignored.
25106	29	These gaps in activities, awareness and lack of time are the most obvious problem that is not talked about. A real change will not be possible until we take care of it. Without specific actions we will not find its solution.
25106	31	The king is naked - let's end with closing our eyes.
25107	1	"We children should not do this. But because almost nobody does anything, we have to "
25107	3	Greta Thunberg - a 16 -year -old fighting for the climate, incl. Striking in front of the Swedish parliament - she published a post on Facebook, in which she responds to charges against her.
25107	5	Greta also became famous for her speech as part of the UN climate conference in Katowice, as well as the recent peak in Davos. She became a symbol and inspiration for the youth strike on the streets of Brussels.
25107	7	We encourage you to read her position, which we translated into Polish:
25107	9	"Recently, I saw many rumors about me and a huge amount of hatred. This is not a surprise to me. I know that since most people are not aware of the full significance of the climate crisis (which is understandable, because it has never been treated as a crisis), the school strike for the climate seems very strange to the general public. Let me explain the matter of my school strike.
25107	11	In May 2018, I was one of the winners in a text for environmental protection, organized by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. My article was published, and some contacted me, among others because Thorén of Fossil Free Dalsland. He had a group of people, especially young people who wanted to do something with a climate crisis. I had several teleconferences with other activists. The goal was to present ideas for new projects that would pay attention to the climate crisis. Because he had some ideas for things we could do - from marches to a loose idea of ​​a kind of school strike (school -age children would do something on school fields or in classes). Parkland students were inspired by us, who refused to go to school after school shootings.
25107	13	I liked the idea of ​​a school strike. So I developed this idea and tried to encourage other young people to join me, but no one was really interested. They thought that the Swedish version of the Zero Hour march would have a greater influence (on society - ed.). That's why I planned a school strike myself, and later I didn't take part in any meetings.
25107	15	When I told my parents about my plans, they didn't like it. They did not support the idea of ​​a school strike and said that if I did it, I would have to act alone and without any support.
25107	17	On August 20, I sat in front of the Swedish parliament. I distributed leaflets with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explanations why I am on strike. The first thing I did was publish information on Twitter and Instagram about what I was doing, and soon it became Viral.
25107	19	Later journalists and newspapers began to come. One of the first was a Swedish entrepreneur working in climate movement, Ingmar Rentzhog. He talked to me and took pictures he published on Facebook. It was the first time I met him or talked to him. I haven't talked to him before or met him.
25107	21	Many people love to spread rumors that I have people "behind me" or I am "paid" or "used" to do what I do. But there is no one "behind" me - except for myself. My parents were as far from climatic activists as possible before I realized the situation.
25107	23	I am not part of any organization. Sometimes I support and work with several non -governmental organizations working for the climate and the environment. But I am absolutely independent and I only represent myself. And I do what I do for free - I did not receive any money or any promise of future payments in any form. Nobody is associated with me or my family. And of course it will remain so. I did not meet a single climate activist who would fight for the climate for money. This idea is completely absurd. In addition, I travel only with the consent of my school, and my parents pay for tickets and accommodation.
25107	25	My family wrote a book together about our family and how I and my sister Beata had influenced the way our parents think and perceive the world, especially when it comes to climate. And about our diagnoses. This book was to be published in May, but because there were serious misunderstandings with the company dealing with its release, we finally changed the publisher. That is why the book was published in August. Before the book was published, parents declared that any profits from the book "Scener Ur Hjärtat" ("Scenes from the Heart") would be transferred to 8 different charity organizations - dealing with the environment, children with diagnoses and animal rights.
25107	27	Yes, I write my own speeches. But because I know that what I say will reach many people, I often ask many people for support. I also have several scientists who I often ask for help in expressing some complicated matters. I want everything to be absolutely correct, so as not to spread incorrect facts or things that may be misunderstood.
25107	29	Some people make fun of me because of my diagnosis. But Asperger is not a disease, it's a gift. People also say that since I have Asperger, I can't put myself in this position. But that's why I did it. Because if I were "normal" and sociable, I would organize myself in an organization or set up an organization myself. But because I'm not so good in dealing with people, I did it instead.
25107	31	I was very frustrated that nothing was done in connection with the climate crisis and I felt that I had to do something, anything. And sometimes not doing anything - like sitting in front of parliament - he says much louder than doing something. Just like a whisper, sometimes it is louder than a scream.
25107	33	There is also an accusation that "I sound and write like an adult." I can only say: do you not think that the 16-year-old can speak for herself? There are also people who say I simplify things. For example, when I say that "a climate crisis is a black and white matter", "we must stop the emission of greenhouse gas" and "I want to panic." But I say that only because it's true. The climate crisis is the most complex issue we have encountered. Stopping it requires comprehensive effort from us.
25107	35	But the solution is black and white-we must stop the emission of greenhouse gas. Because we either limit insulation to 1.5 degrees C in relation to the state before the industrial revolution or not. Or we reach a critical point where we start the chain reaction - with events that are beyond human control - or not. Either we will survive as a civilization or not. There is nothing in between when it comes to survival.
25107	37	And when I say I want panic, I mean that we must treat the crisis as a crisis. When your home is burning, do not sit down and do not talk about how easy you can rebuild it when you go out. If your home is on, run outside and make sure everyone went out when you call the fire brigade. It requires a certain level of panic.
25107	39	There is one more argument that I can't help. It is the fact that I am "only a child and we should not listen to children." But it is easy to fix - just start listening to solid learning. Because if everyone listened to scientists and facts that I constantly refer to - no one would have to listen to me or any of the hundreds of thousands of school children who are striking for the climate around the world. Then we could go back to school.
25107	41	I am only a messenger, and yet I receive all this hatred. I am not saying anything new - I only say what scientists have been saying for decades. And I agree with you - I'm too young to do it. We children should not do this. But because almost nobody does anything and our future is threatened, we feel that we have to continue.
25107	43	And if you have other fears or doubts about me, you can listen to my lecture under TED (https://www.ted.com/..../greta_thunberg_the_disarming_..../up-next), in which I talk about how it started how it started My interest in the climate and the environment.
25107	45	And thank you all for nice support! It gives me hope.

25114	1	EU. However, Tusk got a "commission for Poland"
25114	3	"Now my dear Donald will return to your country to defend values ​​again. ... When we meet again we will see you as you said as a premiere." More or less, because I quote from memory, Ursula von der Leyen said goodbye to Donald Tusk when he left his office in Brussels, and more precisely, when he was blown out of the position of the chairman of the EPL, from the last fuchy that the EU gave him. Tusk was reminded not without reason that he returns to the country to defend the "values", which clearly proves that the EU does not like today's Poland. Tusk had a bad face, because in a sense he was closed to work, which he never eagerly wandered, but he was polite He smiled for this phrase heard, "Dear Donald." This "roads" can be understood literally, Tusk's office cost a lot, but not everything went in Poland as if the Union wished it.
25114	5	The described picture showed 06.07.'22 TVP in evening news. We had "at the hand" there, that Tusk got a "commission for Poland" that he was sent here to make it democratically or undemocratically, for the clients, it was irrelevant, he restored liberal governments in our country. This is another proof of what today's EU is, what "values" prefers, how he understands democracy and how it treats free and independent countries. And all this happens in the light of cameras, in the presence of many prominent EU decision -makers, and clearly shows that democracy and the rule of law are for today's EU decision -makers only empty slogans that are interpreted in such a way as it is convenient for these decision -makers. We did not enter such the EU in 2004. Nobody warned us at the time that the democratically elected government would overthrow on the street, that high state officials, uncomfortable for liberals, would force themselves out of offices (presidents of the NBP and CT), and such actions are announced by Donald Tusk already "anointed" by Ursula von von Der Leyen for the future premiere of Poland. And they say people who have their mouths full of "rule of law", "democracy" and ordinary human "honesty". As you can see, this proper honesty, the rule of law and democracy must be sought there with a candle.
25114	7	The mentioned messages also reminded what judgments the CJEU is issued, a court that is the last resort for leftist liberals, when their other methods used to subordinate individual countries fail. This allegedly only court, authorized to adjudicate, which is law -abiding in the EU, and what is not, turns out to be extremely unfair and extremely non -objective European court, whose main task is to decide in accordance with the interest of Germany and a narrow group of EU decision makers, who admitted themselves the right to manage the Union in completely different directions than those that guided its establishment. The facts of the EU "elite" with the judges of the CJEU are known, as French journalists tracked down. And was it different in Poland, during the time of the Constitutional Tribunal Rzepliński, when the judges of the Tribunals met with PO activists? It is now the opposition who makes a hunt at the Constitutional Tribunal, supporting the reports of the eastern hackers who sow, quite likely, crafted information, and the great brother from the east blots his hands that he found more "useful idiots" who sow confusion among Poles.
25114	9	Does this doctrine that the CJEU follow does not remind us of something? Is this not a kind of substitute so -called "Neumanna doctrine", which says that Polish "free courts" will not move "their own", that is, members and supporters of PO, while they are "my own"? The last "achievement" of the CJEU is his yesterday's decision that EU countries are obliged to accept illegal immigrants who, for various reasons, are not able to officially apply for asylum. What does it mean? This means, among others, that according to the CJEU, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are obliged to take care of the migrants sent to us illegally, recruited to this role by Eastern dictators. That even the "Russian troll" would not come up with that he could demand legalization of his actions. Of course, no reasonable state with this judgment/judgment will agree, as well as individual countries with many judgments of this shady instance, which appears above all law, did not agree. It is interesting that only on Poland, which does not have the most unforgettable judgments of the CJEU, this court imposes large financial penalties, which I hope our country will never pay. Because this Poland, so "non -utuska", the EU does not fit?
25114	11	"Dear Donald", you would like to say finally, go back to Brussels, Alb to some other Berlin, fire the cigars, harataj in a branch and stop dealing with politics, because, as your achievements in this field show, no one of your activities is glad.
25114	13	Ps. I refer to all who accuse me of manipulation to yesterday's TVP news from 19:30, they can be easily found, watch the fragment that starts from the 16th minute.
25115	1	Shocking! President Duda: "Please, to clench some teeth"
25115	3	President Duda met on Tuesday with the inhabitants of the Leipzig poviat (Masovian Voivodeship). During this meeting he also referred to the problem of high inflation: "Unfortunately, not only Polish matters decide what our lives look like, but also external ones have an impact on this (...). I am asking you to be calm because we do everything to minimize inflation pressure. I am asking you to be of good cheer; That you would clench your teeth a little and be optimists. Nobody expected it to come to us. We did not cause war in Ukraine, we did not cause a pandemic. Prices are rising and we have no influence on it. We have to keep it somehow. "
25115	5	We note that the "inflation pressure" has been exerted for years. Unfortunately, the PiS government focuses on helping its style, i.e. by giving away money. Meanwhile, it is the least effective and expensive solution. It is known that for the government to give someone PLN 2, he must take 3 zlotys to someone else, because the cost of transfer and maintaining appropriate officials comes to someone. In addition, one -time or short -term financial assistance is not the same as system assistance, and it burdens the state budget and causes inflation. Programs 500 plus, 300 plus, 13 and 14 retirement, anti -inflation shields, covid add -ons for doctors, and now 300 plus for Ukrainians and 1200 plus are the Polish state significantly, and their effect is above all populist.
25115	7	Such a 1200 plus program causes many doubts. First of all, Poles willingly opened the door of their apartments and houses for Ukrainians, not counting on anything in return. Now the government is mixed up, making the apparent help of those who want to earn - so it activates smart people. A signal flows west because Poles help because they get money. In addition, 300 plus for a million Ukrainians is PLN 300 million, and 1200 plus is already 1 billion 200 million. It may turn out that the program will be extended. It is estimated that up to 5 million refugees can arrive in our country, and then these costs will be gigantic. The EU threw us off, announcing that it would allocate PLN 500 million to help refugees, which in addition will be distributed among all the countries. On the other hand, the Polish government estimates that this assistance can amount to up to PLN 10 billion, i.e. half of what costs us 500 plus.
25115	9	You have to help, but you have to do it with your head. PLN 300 at a time is an emergency help, which will not be enough for a lot, but if 5 million people receive it, it gets a gigantic amount of PLN 1.5 billion. In a situation where we are extremely indebted after Kowida, this type of expenditure is only a budget. It seems that the Polish government happily gets into power, like a gambler who won, felt rich and spends money he did not earn. The thing is that the Polish government has not won any money, but it lets money away not even ours, but our children. It is worth remembering and demanding some moderation.
25115	11	This type of money distribution creates inflation. The concept of "putinflation" is a manipulation, because the war in Ukraine only deepened certain processes. Similarly, the president is right when he says that we had no influence on the appearance of coronavirus, but he does not add that we had a definite influence, or rather the rulers, on the introduction of lockdown, which caused gigantic inflation. The call to tighten teeth in this context is a insolence similar to a situation in which we would first lower salaries and then call him to save. The problem is that the milk spilled and the government will be difficult to stop the tsunami, which it caused. Unfortunately, radical actions are needed, such as raising interest rates, and thus everyone, especially the poorest, suffer. At least let the president not say that it is not the fault of the rulers. This is not true.
25121	1	Success of the Ukrainian army. They destroyed the Russian ammunition magazine. Summary of the night
25121	3	The armed forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation position of the 785. A separate branch of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two magazines with ammunition and the "Fagot" anti -tank rocket complex - the "Południe" operational command said. In turn, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Wereszczuk, almost 800 thousand. internally displaced people will need apartments. See what else happened at night!
25121	5	Almost 800 thousand Ukrainian citizens lost houses
25121	7	- Almost 800 thousand Internally displaced people will need apartments and everything is done to provide them with a place to live and spend winter - said the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of Territories temporarily occupied Iryna Wereszczuk.
25121	9	- As for the need for temporary apartments, almost 800 thousand. Ukrainian citizens lost houses. In this matter, the government has prepared modular construction programs served by the Ministry of Regions, which has appropriate funds for their implementation. As you know, these are joint programs with the Polish government, other governments are also involved in them, the first modular cities have already been created, but this is definitely not enough - said Iryna Wereszczuk.
25121	11	She noticed that she witnessed the situation in the Czernihowski region, where people did not really want to live in modular cities, because they previously lived in their own private buildings. They said, we want "at least one room, but in our garden". "But it can't be provided yet," said Wereszczuk.
25121	13	Slavic mer: there will be no heating season in the city
25121	15	The Slavic Mer said Wadly Lach on Sunday that because of the war it would not be possible to start in the city with the advent of the colds of the heating season.
25121	17	"Currently, there is no water or gas in Slavic, and the electricity is supplied with breaks due to the proximity of the high -voltage line to the war zone," said the city of the city with Wady Lach in an interview with Donbas News. He added that in such conditions, it would not be possible to start the heating season with the advent of cold weather.
25121	19	He emphasized that Slavic residents should evacuate because attempts to conquer the city by the Russian army will continue.
25121	21	The armed forces destroyed the Russian ammunition magazine and an observation post
25121	23	The armed forces of Ukraine destroyed the command and observation position of the 785. A separate branch of the National Guard of the Russian Federation, two magazines with ammunition and the "Fagot" anti -tank rocket complex - the Ukrainian truth said on Monday based on the "Południe" operational commander.
25121	25	According to the Monday report, "Południe" was liquidated 66 Russians, five tanks, two self -propelled Goździk howitzers, three armored vehicles and nine cars.
25121	27	The armed forces also destroyed the Merlin-VR drone near Iwanówka, where the Russians tried to conduct air reconnaissance.
25121	29	Ukrainian aviation made five hits to enemy positions. In particular, 3 enemy positions in the Berysławski poviat were attacked. The pairs of fighters Mi-8 and Mi-24 destroyed 2 enemy positions in the Kersonia region, informs ok "noon".
25127	1	Terrorists from Ordo Iuris
25127	3	The biggest noise of the 1920s is "Hybrid War". Putin, Lukashenko, but also Brussels, is conducted by the hybrid war against Poland. We hear about the hybrid war almost every day, the fashion for the hybrid war dominated our policy. And I wanted to ask for old -school terrorism.
25127	5	According to the European Commission, terrorism is "all deliberate acts committed by individuals or organizations against countries, their institutions or population, in order to intimidate." The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adds that it is about actions motivated by "extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism or irrational and subjective factors, oriented to create a terror atmosphere among public figures, specific individuals or groups in society or in the whole society."
25127	7	In accordance with these definitions, I am asking you to enter the Pro - the right to life and the Institute for Legal Culture Ordo Iuris, as well as Kai Godek on the EU list of people, groups and entities that, in connection with participation in the terrorist acts, are subject to sanctions. At the beginning, although there should also be a place for several other "life defenders". Whose action is undoubtedly focused on "intimidation", as well as "creating a climate of terror" among the "specific group" - medics, especially related to gynecology and obstetrics, but not only - and is undeniably motivated by "extremist ideological concepts, fanaticism and irrational subjective factors. " And also - although this condition is no longer in the definition - it causes the death of innocent people.
25127	9	For the order: no one who is not a spiritual king of Kai Godek has doubts that the loud death of a pregnant woman in a hospital in Pszczyna is a direct effect of the decision of the Przyłębska Tribunal regarding the prohibition of "eugenic abortion". There is no field for interpretation here: the fetus had congenital defects, in addition, Małowodzie took place - that is, it was damaged - before that it could be removed, now not; If it were removed on time, the woman would probably live. And so she died. So much.
25127	11	But in the context of terrorism, the second aspect is more important - interrupting pregnancy to save a woman's health and life. Theoretically, still permissible. According to the Federation for women and family planning, after the announcement of the judgment of the Przyłębska Tribunal, three hundred legal abortions were made in Poland - that is, abortion to save the mother's life and health. That's 15 times more than before. Which means that there are brave doctors putting the good of patients over their comfort and safety in Poland. Nevertheless, which is repeated by opponents of the tightening of anti -abortion law - the state has no right to require heroism citizens. Nor from women who are forced to dedicate to the fetus; Nor from doctors who, when deciding to stop pregnancy, today risk their professional future and maybe freedom. And here we enter the intimidation area.
25127	13	As prof. Marzena Dębska, a gynecolor, never known who will be the author of an expertise in a possible disciplinary or criminal case related to the interruption of pregnancy to save a woman's life. And medicine differs from mathematics in that the same numbers - e.g. informing about inflammation, the CPR indicator - can be interpreted differently. As already seriously threatening life - i.e. justifying treatment by removing the fetus - or not yet. Nobody probably doubts that if Ziobry's prosecutor's office decided to do a demonstration trial of a doctor accused of unlawful interruption of pregnancy, he would find experts in the style of prof. Chazan, famous for forcing women to give birth to children without heads. Prof. Mariusz Zimmer, president of the Polish Society of gynecologists and obstetricians, points out that among people finishing medicine there are no very lucrative specialization for this otherwise. Too much risk. In a word: doctors are intimidated.
25127	15	The integrist attack line for cases such as Pszczyna can be seen exactly in the statement of Magdalena Majkowska's lawyer from Ordo Iuris, who, knowing the matter only from the media, did not fail to go to television and announce that the drama is a error in medical art. Because "doctors are not afraid to interrupt pregnancy to save the mother's life and health", so if one does not break when needed, it's his fault. Let him be afraid.
25127	17	However, it is difficult to find an act of intimidation more spectacular than reported by the Pro - the right to life, and the citizens' initiative written by Ordo Iuris hiding under the enigmatic name "on the amendment of the Penal Code and some other acts". This is the famous project that tolerates the anti -abortion law and equals the termination of pregnancy with the murder. The reporter of the project is Mariusz Dzierżawski, and his deputy Łukasz Jończyk - and for them there should also be a place on the terrorist list, because the very application of such a project is undoubtedly oriented to create the climate of terror.
25128	1	Fuck out, but where?
25128	3	Among the many banners present on anti -Polish protests, one was particularly conspicuous - with a concise slogan: "fuck!" This issue, however, is more complicated than it may seem - and requires clarification. Fuck out, but who? Kaczyński himself? Whole PiS? With or without youth? And Solidarna Polska, Sofa Gowina and the Confederation can stay?
25128	5	Other, perhaps even more difficult issue, concerns where to fuck out. Mass emigration, especially in the era of Covid, seems difficult to meet. According to party data, PiS currently belongs to over 40,000 people-only during the previous term of office this number increased by half. So where to send these people? And who would like them?
25128	7	It's easy to shout "fuck out!", But what then, nobody thinks about it. To check if this beautiful political slogan has an impact on practice, I decided to analyze the export from Poland of only one person: PiS president. He enjoys such an authority on the right that if he leaves alone, the rest will inevitably follow him.
25128	10	1. Russia
25128	12	I have read all the Deputy Prime Minister's biographies available on the market and a sad picture emerges from them. Jarosław was privately abroad only once-as an 18-year-old on the Black Sea in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, even from this trip he was not satisfied. In an interview with "Two such ... Kaczyński brothers' alphabet" Kaczyński recalls a hot vacation: "Supply at the catastrophic level. They ate bread with sawdust a few years earlier (...) After returning to Poland, we had the impression that we were coming back to the zone of freedom and wealth. "
25128	14	Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, some time has passed, and Russia has become a valued house of peaceful old age for fallen warlords. There, for example, Wiktor Yanukovych, a Ukrainian expiative, sentenced, sentenced in 13 years in prison, for example.
25128	16	Unfortunately, Putin-Kaczyński's relationships are not the best. When Jarosław was the prime minister in 2006-2007, the gentlemen did not meet even once. In 2010, as you know, Putin murdered Kaczyński's brother, who went to Russia with a guest visit. This is not the best ground for living together. Although it is worth adding that the city of Jarosław is already located above the upper Volga, with over 600,000 inhabitants, named after another wise Jarosław - Prince Jarosław the Misegre.
25128	18	Kaczyński's nature is also such that he would immediately start making Putin near the pen, and although it is a great country, one dictator has been enough for years. Even if Kaczyński managed to cause another revolution in Russia, which was already favorable for Poland in Poland regaining independence, it does not seem real that this man close to the Bolsheviom was able to get on a horse and go to the border.
25128	20	Language is another, no less important barrier. The president is not "Panimajet, you will chat." If we add to this the fact that the Pisowska elite could feel a historically justified anxiety before traveling deep into this strongly forested country, it becomes clear that Jaroslaw to Russia can go not to emigration, but at most for tea.
25128	24	2. England
25128	26	The most popular emigration goal among Poles. Kaczyński would suit even in this respect that he could try to create another government in the history of exile and spend decrees, give orders and pretend to exercise real power. However, the president was already on the Thames and - to put it mildly - he did not like it. In November 1989, the authorities of the Civic Parliamentary Club told him to go to London to mobilize English politicians and local Polonia regarding the recognition of the Polish-German border. In the book "Agreement against monoval", the president recalls: "At the airport I had problems with passport control. Despite the diplomatic passport, I was asked what I wanted to do and where to live. I was effortless to answer something (...). I returned to Poland with a relief. "
25128	28	A year later, Kaczyński took another flight to England - this time he did not even leave the airport area. He immediately went to Warsaw by return with Ryszard Kaczorowski, who decided to return the insignia of the head of the Second Polish Republic.
25128	30	You had to wait 20 years for the next visit to the queen's country. In June 2010, as a PiS candidate for president, Kaczyński visited Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameras captured the kind welcome of the British and the reaction of Kaczyński: the words "Aj Dont Anderstend", combined with panic waving his hands and looking for a translator.
25128	32	On March 22, 2017, Kaczyński went to London for the last time to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and discuss the issue of Brexit. Through the terrorist attack on the Westminster bridge, however, he had to stay forcibly in London for the night. This is not - you admit - the memory you want to come back to.
25128	34	Among the advantages of staying in England, Kaczyński could undoubtedly mention that the country ceased to belong to the European Union, imposing its opinion on the rule of law or human rights. In addition, Kaczyński, who, among others Through two of English he did not pass in high school from class to class, he could come across numerous Poles in the Islands and open his mouth in the only known speech. However, there is a risk that among the compatriots there could be people unfavorable to the president - even pro -abortion activists who protested in large numbers last week before the Embassy in London. And he would end up at least after the murder.
2514	1	Can vaccinations against Covid be mandatory? HFPC legal opinion
2514	3	In the Sejm, the parliamentary bill is waiting for the introduction of compulsory vaccinations against Covid-19. "The current epidemic situation may justify the extension of the obligation to vaccinate also for vaccination against Covid-19. Such a step would be important for the protection of the health of people who cannot vaccinate, as well as to guarantee effective access to healthcare for people who suffer from diseases other than Covid-19 "-emphasizes HFPC in his legal opinion.
2514	5	Authority
2514	7	In its opinion, HFPC pointed out that the constitution imposes on the public authorities the obligation to combat infectious diseases, although it does not specify how it should be implemented in detail.
2514	9	A way to fulfill this commitment can be compulsory vaccinations against specific epidemic diseases and the authorities have been using this solution for at least a dozen years. In its opinion, HFPC reminds that in Poland the vaccination order affects as many as 14 diseases and so far the constitutionality of such obligations has not been undermined. Importantly, the already functioning act allows you to cover the obligation of protective vaccination also those against coronavirus. The adoption of a separate act in this regard would allow you to dispel any doubts around the legality of the obligation formulated in such a way, guaranteeing its better enforcement.
2514	11	Vaccinations and personal freedom
2514	13	The vaccination order interferes with the personal freedom of the individual and its right to respect private life. However, these rights are not absolute. Under certain conditions and under certain principles, they may be limited.
2514	15	In this regard, the Constitution requires that such restrictions should be established only in the Act and only if they are necessary in a democratic state to protect specific values. Among them, he mentions the health, rights and freedoms of other people, as well as public order.
2514	17	Tribunal in Strasbourg: Compulsory vaccinations do not violate the rights
2514	19	The obligation of protective vaccinations has recently been the subject of the European Court of Human Rights. In the case of Vavřička and other Mrs. Czechs, he recognized mandatory vaccinations in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights. At the same time, he outlined a number of circumstances that should be taken into account when assessing whether vaccination against a specific disease should become mandatory.
2514	21	It is worth emphasizing that in this matter the Polish government also submitted its opinion, in which he noted that the obligation to vaccinate as such does not violate the rights and freedoms specified in the Convention.
2514	23	The epidemic situation requires action
2514	25	In the light of the criteria outlined by the ECtHR, it should be considered that the current epidemic situation may justify the extension of the obligation to vaccinate against Covid-19 vaccination. "Another, alternative solution to counteracting pandemic could be to introduce further restrictions on the freedom of movement, almost learning, freedom of conducting business activity. It would be highly debatable to say that such funds would have a less painful character than the obligation to undergo protective vaccinations, "HFPC points out in his opinion.
25140	1	Cannon meat in stock
25140	3	The Red Army is apparently green. In fighting. Soldiers fight without conviction and kill only out of habit. The Ruthenian gang maneuvers resemble scenes from the comedy about military Patały in this war. And it is the Gypsies that will pour their tank, and they shoot their own positions, the tanks are standing because there was no fuel, and the soldiers give up, because there was no supply and they have not eaten for three days. The myth of the great Russian army fell like Napoleon at Waterloo.
25140	5	The only successes that the Russian troops were noted in shelling of apartment blocks and killing civilians. It is easy to hit civilians, because there are a lot of them, and scruples, just like ethical values, do not have an army. Ukraine was to be occupied in three days, meanwhile three weeks pass and successes are like Polish athletes at the Chinese Olympics. Oh there will be no medals for this war.
25140	7	Unfortunately, Putin completely does not count with losses and will send more soldiers to some death. A man in Russian war tactics is nothing. "Lot Ludiej" was to say Stalin. During the Second World War, the so -called Diagnosis. Branches moved to the strengthened German positions, which had the Nazis in the front, and NKVD platoons behind the back. These troops were sent to a certain slaughter, but it was about the discovery of German fire stations, which were then bombarded.
25140	9	Putin so -called He began the second Chechen war with provocation. In 1999, in Moscow, Riazania and Wołgodońsk, special services blew up apartments. It happened at night and in the morning. Several hundred sleeping citizens were killed. Czech separatists were accused of assassinations and then Putin said the famous words that we would get them and drown them even in the toilet, which the nation who wanted revenge liked. Today it is known that Putin's services stood behind the attacks, and blowing up apartments was a provocation to justify the slaughter slaughter.
25140	11	Also in this war, Putin is not sorry for either Russians or Ukrainians. He just regies that he has not yet won Kiev and that he cannot announce the winner as soon as he wanted.
25141	1	Agata's silence
25141	3	It is louder than shooting from the cannon. He is eloquent and calls in his ears like three alarm clock at once.
25141	5	When there were black protests of umbrellas. She was silent. When there were feminine protests with hangers. She was silent. When the police beat women during the women's strike. She was silent. When nurses and guardians of disabled people protested. She was silent.
25141	7	When the police were exposed to fifteen -year -old police stations, for vulgar shouts at demonstrations. She was silent. When the children from Michałów were taken to the swamps and to the forest. She was silent.
25141	9	I saw a movie how he reads fairy tales at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. It suits her. Andrzej's husband also tells fairy tales. And not only at the castle, but all the time. Maybe Agata should read something about women's rights?
25141	11	Now, when, as a result of the actions of the lobby of religious fanatics and the decision of the Przyłębska Court, the provisions on the total ban on removing pregnancy, even in the case of rape or threat to life, a young girl from Pszczyna dies, she is also silent.
25141	13	And she could make a small gesture. After all, he comes from a good, Krakow family. Families of sensitive poets. When on the day of the premiere of the propaganda film Smolensk, she went to another film, it was perceived almost as a demonstration of independence. But she was never independent and will not be.
25141	15	Chic costumes and elegance will not cover the lack of class and heart. Cold, calculated, predictable as German grammar exercises.
25141	17	She found her in the life of the Fuch of the century. By chance, a husband, a man without a spine, about the mentality of a junior high school student and appearance of Jasia Beani, became president and she was the first lady.
25141	19	There will be no spoil when a woman from a small town far from Warsaw, a woman whom she does not know, will die as a result of stupid law. She will not spoil the comfort of living in the Presidential Palace, when some women suffer, fight for their own and are beaten.
25141	21	And there is already a second term. Nobody will take off Andrzej out of Fuchy. And the second time on the chair in the palace cannot start. So she could even feel sorry.
25141	23	There is a saying that you have to have money and appearance for "master". Just have a heart for the first lady. As you can see, it was missing.
25143	1	Trouble with reaching, i.e. the traveling circus of Mr. President
25143	3	Everyone who once had a new car knows that for the first few thousand kilometers you must not drink a car and press the gas pedal. The new car must get.
25143	5	Jarosław Kaczyński is not a freshman in politics, but rather sharply arrived. And despite this, he concerns the problems of reaching.
25143	7	Poles, who are hindering to enter Jarosław, who are difficult to enter his supposed meetings. The accelerator pedal in this matter is sharply pressed by the police, which chases all citizens who want to tell the president what they think about him.
25143	9	Recently, in Kórnik, at a meeting with the local community, only previously marked individuals brought by coaches were admitted, while the locals were blocked by strengthened police forces.
25143	11	Reaching Jaroslaw was like breaking a fortified castle. Police cars and armed to the teeth policemen protecting the Savior of the nation are a view to which everyone has already got used to. A certain novelty was the police horse troops, which were practiced by police Rodeo, scaring volunteers who wanted to meet with Jarosław.
25143	13	Protection specialists say that if the temperature of the challenging circus of the president is intensified at the pace as recently, then neither horse patrols nor uhlan charges with police cars are not enough. You will need to strengthen protection with combat vehicles, tanks, and perhaps rocket launchers. Military specialists say that for the next meetings of the president you will have to build trenches and stretch barbed wire. Anti -personnel mines may also be useful.
25143	15	A large amount of equipment in connection with the war in Ukraine has recently been purchased, so there will be no problem with it. The only question is whether not cheaper to make meetings with the local community in offices in Nowogrodzka, since hired actors and statusists play the role of local? Each time, send only the TVP team, which is masked and with stucky mustache files several pictures from a given town and such material is dominated by a beautiful report from Jarozbawa's local visits.
25148	1	Silver for Sunday (because silence is gold)
25148	3	Uncompromising Szymon
25148	5	Uncompromising Szymon Hołownia, the leader of Poland2050 has always criticized the rule of the United Right. He also wrote negatively about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, it turned out that he founded the Dobra Factory founded in 2020 received PLN 680,000 with subsidies from that ministry. He probably accepted them in disgust, but he accepted. I am interested in one thing: what did he get them for? Maybe for an equally critical attitude towards Platforma Obywatelska and its presidential candidate?
25148	7	Successes of Polish order
25148	9	Polish teachers' politicians of the United Right promised a noticeable increase in earnings, while at the beginning of January pedagogues rubbed their eyes in amazement, seeing the amounts that influenced their accounts. It turned out that their salaries are several hundred zlotys lower than December. One day, the Minister of Education and Science Przemysław Czarnek accused the journalist of a lie in connection with questions about lower payments of teachers after the introduction of Polish order. He argued that it was "certainly not through Polish order, but for other reasons." The next day, however, a spokesman for government Piotr Mueller admitted that there were lower salaries and apologized for "legislative inaccuracies". In the end, even the prime minister apologized for mistakes and promised to repair them with the help of a new regulation. The problem is that, as lawyers agree, laws cannot be changed by ordinances. But who would care about such trifles when repairing this flagship work, after all, in our beautiful country, the law does not mean much, if it is not hand in hand with justice ...
25148	11	It is not enough once!
25148	13	Even before the new year, the Kraśnik beltway was opened for the first time. This took place with the modest assistance of local government officials from PiS, public television and with the participation of Jarosław Stawiarski (PiS), the Marshal of the Lublin Province. But it is not enough once! A few days later, traffic was arrested on the already put on the road and the ribbon was cut again again. This time with the participation of Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin and ministers: infrastructure of Andrzej Adamczyk, funds and regional policy of Grzegorz Puda, Education and Science Przemysław Czarnek and Deputy Minister of Finance Piotr Patkowski. Almost 60 people were invited to the second, much more loud opening, including the same local government officials as in the previous week. I wonder if they had Déjà VU during the second event ...
25148	15	Dura lex, sed lex
25148	17	Do you remember how during the protests of women's strike in connection with the tightening of anti -abortion law, a nineteen -year -old police broke their hand? The girl brought the case to the court against the police. Well, recently, after a year of consideration, this case ended with redemption. Meanwhile, suspected of painting anti -government and anti -church slogans on the facade of the church of St. At the request of the prosecutor's office, the Court placed the cross in temporary detention for three months. Polish criminal law, however, is a real jungle, full of secrets and surprises, because in his thought it turned out that writing spray on the wall is more dangerous to society than violence and body damage.
25154	1	Kraska: We have 599 new infections. The number of infections is falling
25154	3	The number of coronavirus infections in Poland a week to a week falls. Last Monday, there were 618 new cases. Today, according to the words of Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraski, Covid-19 was confirmed in 599. "This is, if we compare a week to a week, a decrease by 2 %, i.e. there is less week to a week"- He summed up a politician in an interview with TVP.
25154	5	Infections a week to a week are less 2 percent.
25154	7	The Ministry of Health publishes data on new infections or deaths in connection with Covid-19 every day. They are made public at 10.30. On August 8, however, we met the latest data in advance. Information about infection on Monday morning was provided by Deputy Minister of Health Waldemar Kraska.
25154	9	-Today it is 599 cases [Covid-19] that is, if we compare a week to week, a decrease by 2 %, which is less week to a week. These are small numbers, because these are numbers from the weekend, but if we look at the statistics and also the surroundings of our country, i.e. Western European countries, but also the Czech Republic, Slovakia we see a downward wave everywhere, i.e. this summer wave of Coronavirus is definitely weaker - said Waldemar Kraska on TVP.
25154	11	Epidemic situation in Poland - data from August 7
25154	13	The day before, on August 7, 2022, the Ministry of Health informed about 698 new coronavirus infections. Most cases were recorded in the province. Mazowiecki (105), Śląskie (78) and Lesser Poland (61). Seven people infected Covid-19 recovered. That day there was not a single death among the sick.
25162	1	The Chinese army continues the exercises around Taiwan
25162	3	On Monday, the Chinese army continues exercises in the seas and airspace around Taiwan - the Command of the Eastern Theater of the Chinese People's Army (ALW) informed in social media.
25162	5	The army will conduct "practical exercises in maritime and air space". Chinese soldiers are to train, among others In attacking submarines - was forwarded in a statement posted on the Weibo platform.
25162	7	China has been conducting unprecedented military exercises in waters and in the airspace surrounding Taiwan since Thursday. Some maneuvers take place only 20 km from the Taiwanese coast. Maneuvers are a reaction to the recent visit of the Chairwoman of the Chamber of US representatives Nancy Pelosia in Taipei, against whom Beijing strongly protested. Initially, it was reported that the exercises would end on Sunday.
25167	1	The great coral reef is great not only by name. She just stood up to climate change
25167	3	Is it possible nowadays to write something optimistic and positive by discussing climate change and coral reef? Contrary to intuition, it turns out that yes. This is really surprisingly good news
25167	5	As reported by scientists from the Australian Institute of Sea, the Great Coral Reef is currently the largest in almost 40 years. Nobody expected such a "revival", which covers up to 2/3 of the large coral reef.
25167	7	It is well known that climate change, constant heating of ocean waters exhibit sensitive to temperature and sunlight to really difficult development conditions. Increasingly appearing waves of heat, and thus increases in sea temperature cause so -called Caudis fading, which leads to a gradual dying of this fascinating ecosystem.
25167	9	The coral reef is slowly rebuilt
25167	11	The more surprising is the processes described by scientists in the report taking place in the northern and central regions of the Great Coral Reef. It seems that the corals have decided to fight for survival. Oceanographers have not seen such an intensive process of reconstruction for decades.
25167	13	Considering that for now the atmosphere heating process is progressing at an increasingly faster pace, especially the fact that the fading of the coral reef from 2020 and 2022 is not as intense as 5-6 years ago. This, in turn, means that corals are increasingly enduring the conditions in the ocean and are able to rebuild.
25167	15	Of course, here we are talking about a big step in the right direction, but still far away. Researchers indicate that in the central part of the large coral reef, live corals reached 33 percent, and in the northern region as much as 36 percent. This may not seem much, but it is already an increase that restores the hope that corals can be reborn and come back to life. If this trend persisted in the coming years, and the episodes of fading the reef would become a bit rarer, perhaps a wonderful coral reef, which is one of the most unique sea ecosystems on earth, it can return to full gloria and protect against extinction of thousands of species, which on it, which on it They rely.
25171	1	In TVP "Wiadomości"! Like Tusk with Germany "invented mercury"
25171	3	One can be sure: as long as PiS rules, nothing can be explained in a final and reliable way. We will hear a story that will bring the least damage to power.
25171	5	The main editions of TVP "News" on Monday and Tuesday (August 15-16) had a clear message about the ecological disaster on the Oder: The situation is under control, and "total opposition" with German inspiration lies about mercury in the river. Tusk's metaphors about the "dream state of PiS" and "PiS, which is like mercury" are an empty slander in relation to the authorities who cannot be accused of the Odra.
25171	7	"Wiadomości" from August 15 was a pathetic and religious occasional program (Polish Army Day), in which one could, among others To find out from Danuta Holecka herself that the Mother of God has twice appeared to Russian soldiers, defending them to enter Warsaw. This vision caused panic in the Bolshevik ranks. In addition, on the occasion of the Christmas concert in Elbląg, a heaven of the Vistula Spit was praised to the heavens - not only as an investment in Poland's independence, but also a great economic undertaking. There are no doubts - even in the latter issue - journalists of public television do not have.
25171	9	TVP. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride
25171	11	It is very difficult to find yourself in this characteristic infantile and military aesthetics and rhetoric to someone who was not raised on Russian-Asian patterns of public life. Older Poles remember this from the Polish People's Republic and probably some like it. You know, youth. Those who do not remember the Polish People's Republic can associate the style of Jacek Kurski's television with China or other Eastern countries. Something comes to us through movies and movies. This exaltation, these emotions, this pride ... Only do we really have to get on Asia? Does Jacek Kurski, producing his "messages" for President Kaczyński, see in him little XI Jinping? By the way, an interesting trail: Asian features of Jarosław Kaczyński. I throw a ball - let sinologists catch.
25171	13	In any case, the psychological profile of the President of Poland in the eyes of the president of TVP will remain the secret of the latter, although Mr. Kurski needs to be admired for the professionalism in the craft of propaganda and a huge devotion to the work on a stool, from which several other men would gladly push him.
25171	15	Let's return to the Oder. The message from Tuesday, August 16, was much more extensive. A lot of specific information was provided, which we also know from other media. How many water samples were taken, which could happen (as you know, it is not known yet) how much dead fish was fished. First of all, it was informed (it seems true) that the situation is improving.
25171	17	Resting of the Odra was also mentioned, for what (as Prime Minister Morawiecki assured on Tuesday) there will be funds. Generally, according to the material "News", nothing happened so much, and the cause of the disaster - although unknown - is probably related to the low water condition, which after all causes various ecological problems not only with us. I will add here that in the Nawah of journalistic materials about the Odrzańska disaster, very little is said about how this water condition actually shaped. It seems not so low again. There is almost no talk of retention reservoirs and mucus, and therefore whether the possibilities of thinning the Odra waters were used. This topic will probably return.
25171	19	Tusk compares PiS to mercury
25171	21	Meanwhile, we are watching Tuesday's "News". Immediately after the material about the Odra, maintained in a fairly material tone, there was a real explosion of hate on Donald Tusk. Here is the "total opposition" uses the misfortune, which is an ecological disaster, to a dirty political war, which leads hand in hand with Germany. The defense in this war was disinformation on the alleged presence of mercury in the Oder, which is not confirmed. It is flooded with a "avalanche of lies" and it has it in his blood. It is enough to remind that Prime Minister Kopacz said that there was no money for any 500 plus, and at the same time Tusk announced that he would introduce a similar program. As you can see, he is a spur. He once raised his retirement age, and now he wants a four -day working day ...
25171	23	Admittedly, I can not keep up with the four -day day of work, but as for PiS as a dream fish and comparing it to mercury, it does not seem to be the epithets somehow very exuberant - and regardless of how many mercury compounds were finally detected or not detected. The insinuation that after the Germans "invented mercury" is absurd. The news about mercury appeared in the German media, and at the same time heard about her by the marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship Elżbieta Polak from the Minister of the Brandenburg environment Alex Vogl. Probably somewhere a mercury relationship was detected, but this was not confirmed in subsequent samples. Tusk used PiS comparison with mercury when the "mercury hypothesis" was still on time. The hypothesis has already gone down in history, but the metaphor has not lost its relevance - and for many reasons.
25171	25	The opposition does not accuse the authorities that they allowed the fact that there was one or another chemical in the Odra (maybe the time will also come to such allegations), but that it did not react on time. And this is a key matter. This is what the game is going on and this is focused on the PR power strategy. This is shown by press conferences of dignitaries, which took place on Tuesday, August 16. After a very professional and detailed message of environmental ministers and infrastructure, journalists began to ask about the date of intervention by central institutions. The questions remained unanswered, and the official leading the conference unceremoniously "extinguished them". It was obvious that the topic of delay was reserved for the "mountain" itself (because the prime minister spoke about it, dismissing two high officials), while the ministers of Moscow and Adamczyk were not to speak in this archocie of the matter.
25171	27	PiS is running forward
25171	29	Ostentatious refusal to answer is a terrible strategy. However, literally from hour to hour there was a fundamental change. Here, at the conference of the Lower Silesian Voivode, Jarosław Obrębski (PiS) and his deputies were presented numerous details about the chronology of events. The explanation of several days delay in decisive activities in Lower Silesia, given by local authorities from PiS, was such that after the first signals about numerous dream fish, the situation came, and only after a few days its radical deterioration. Thus, the authorities' reactions were proportional and corresponded to the development of the situation. This is a preview of the new PiS narrative. Yes, there were delays, but justified by the dynamics of the disaster.
25171	31	So you can talk about a lack of foresight rather than about neglect. At the same time, PiS "escapes forward", because as "News" boasted, the government now wants to create the most modern system of early warning about water pollution in Europe. It has as much credibility as electric cars and Morawiecki's ferries, but it can be useful to calm the electorate. A lot can still happen in the drama "Ecological disaster of the Odra River". There may also be little and in two weeks the topic will disappear, replaced by a completely new one. Today it is difficult to assess the likelihood of both of these scenarios. One we can be sure - as long as PiS rules, nothing can be explained in a final and reliable way. We will hear a story that will bring the least damage to power.
25173	1	Mercury lost in translation. Propaganda distracts attention from the defeat of the government on the Odra
25173	3	The pro -government media and PiS politicians yesterday's statement of the German minister recognized as evidence of "lies" of Marshal Elżbieta Pole about the presence of mercury in the Oder. Propaganda diverted his attention from the sluggish reaction of the Polish government to the river contamination all Monday
25173	5	At the end of the day on Monday, it turned out that the German measurements actually showed mercury in the water, but it was taken not from the mainstream of the river and it is already known that it is not responsible for the death of fish. Still, three weeks from the first signals about the Odra disaster, it is not known what kills the river.
25173	7	On August 15, however, he was a day of mercury and Prime Minister Morawiecki could throw accusations of fake news at a press conference on the Oder.
25173	9	The element lost in translation
25173	11	Information that the measles can kill mercury salt appeared at the end of the week. PO activists repeated it, citing the first German analyzes.
25173	13	Marshal Elżbieta Pole published a photo from the video conferencing with the German minister on Twitter and wrote that this "in a direct conversation" admitted that "the concentration of mercury in the Oder was so high that the scale could not be determined." Thus, she confirmed the reports of the German radio and RBB television, which was the first to publicly provide mercury information in the river.
25173	15	For a good mercury scandal, she started on Sunday, because government propaganda made the main problem of the Oder and argued that this was false information spread by the opposition. It began after joint Polish-German consultations and a press conference on the Odra situation on Sunday, August 14, 2022. This was to be the beginning of a new, better cooperation between both countries in order to determine the causes of the ecological disaster. Instead, we got over the diplomatic scandal.
25173	17	The TVP journalist asked the German delegation whether mercury was found in the samples from the river, according to the Marshal's Pole.
25173	19	"The Marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship wrote on Twitter on Friday that the Lord confirmed her personally that the mercury concentration in the Oder was so high that the scale could not be determined. I wanted to ask you if you said such words, on what basis and why " - that was the question. But, as we wrote in OKO.press, a Polish translator who gave the question to the Minister of Agriculture and the German environment of Brandenburg Axel Vogl asked him if he said the Marshal of the Pole that Odra was "corrosive". He omitted the issue of mercury.
25173	21	Vogel replied that "such a statement is not known to him." "We informed that the pH is very high and we cannot explain why this happened," he added.
25173	23	But although the question was poorly translated, Polish pro -government media decided that the minister denied. And they started a hunt for Elżbieta Polak.
25173	25	PiS politicians delivered sharp words to quotes on Twitter.
25173	27	"After this statement of the German minister, it is reasonable to suspect that Elżbieta Pole in a crisis situation disinformed public opinion on the situation on the Oder. In my opinion, this should explain the relevant services, "wrote the deputy minister of interior and administration on Sunday evening Paweł Szefernaker.
25173	29	"This is a nice scandal. So the Marshal of the Lubuskie Voivodeship invented mercury? Maybe to divert attention from problems in her WORD? " Maciej Wąsik, also deputy head in the Ministry of Interior and Administration, followed him.
25173	31	"The matter is obvious. The official position of Germany is known, "said the case of the Deputy Minister of the Climate and the Environment Jacek Ozdoba.
25173	33	"Marshal of the province Lubuski »disinformed the public" on mercury? " - This is a question that was still on Monday noon on the main page of the tvp.info portal. Similar titles appeared on wpolityce.pl and Polska Times.
25173	35	Germany is amazed
25173	37	"This is outrageous! I was asked by a translator about an alleged quote from me that water in the Oder can burn his hands. I reacted to this and explained the pH values. I was not asked about mercury, "Vogel wrote on Twitter this morning.
25173	39	He attached to the entry he attached screenshots of screens made available by one of the Twitterers showing how pro -government Polish media use Vogl's statement to deny the alleged fake news of the Marshal of the Pole.
25173	41	As it turned out, the German minister at the conference did not hear a question about mercury, so he could not deny anything.
25173	43	The pro -government media, however, managed to redirect attention to this kind of "success" of power - no mercury in the river. Thousands of dead fish, the contamination of the Odra and the tardiness of the government in response to the ecological disaster went to the background.
25173	45	There was a mercury, but it wasn't she who kills
25173	47	We still don't know what killed thousands of fish in the Oder. For now, Polish and German research indicates a high salinity of water, elevated - alkaline - pH and increased oxygen concentration.
25173	49	The email sent to OKO.press from the Ministry of the Brandenburg environment showed that the mercury level was still checked. In this context, the Saturday message of the Minister of the Climate Minister, in which he ensures that the Germans did not find the presence of mercury in the water, seemed premature (at a press conference on Sunday the minister reported that Poland "was working on the identification of the source").
25173	51	"For today, none of the research has confirmed the presence of toxic substances. We also conduct fish research. We have completed a study for mercury and heavy metals - they were not found in samples. In the near future we will check 300 more indicators, "Moscow said on Sunday.
25173	53	On Monday afternoon, the German authorities summarized the meeting with the Polish side.
25173	55	Minister Axel Vogel confirmed that he warned Elżbieta Polak, that in the first sample examined by the Germans a high mercury concentration was detected. In an interview with the marshal, however, he was to add that the sample could be an anomaly, and the tests should be performed again.
25173	57	Subsequent samples were to give results within the limits of environmental tolerance or slightly exceeding it.
25173	59	Vogel said that he did not think that mercury was the cause of dying fish. Because this element accumulates in living organisms for a long time.
25173	61	"We err in the dark, we study insecticides, pesticides, all kinds of substances," admitted Vogel.
25173	63	In the evening, the German Minister of the Environment Steffi Lemke said that although research is still underway and it is still unknown what poisoned the river, "mercury does not seem to be the cause of fish mortality." Spokesman Lemke Urlich Schulte told Polsat News that "mercury was not detected in both dream fish and in water itself. So today we can exclude it. "
25173	65	On the other hand, the Polish Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection admitted that in German samples, taken in the Odra oxbow lakes and its tributaries, there was mercury. On the other hand, Polish research in the mainstream of the mercury river did not show, and the State Veterinary Inspection excluded mercury as a cause of fishing.
25173	67	Dreamy fish in the Gliwice Canal
25173	69	Min. Vogel also emphasized information about the contamination of the Oder at the height of Wrocław, the German side should have been obtained from Poland on July 28. "However, this did not happen. We were surprised, "he regretted.
25173	71	"The first dream fish in Brandenburg were noticed on August 9. We didn't have any warning from Poland, "said spokesman Schulte. And it was two weeks after the information about the contamination of the Odra appeared in Poland. Earlier, anglers informed about dead fish in the Gliwice Canal.
25176	1	Piszów eco-omerta
25176	3	They go to the Odra. The opposition is rightly pressing for details. This is a whole avalanche of questions. On the parliamentary committee and in the media. If they answered honestly, as it was, there would be a chance to cooperate with political forces. But they did not read Bartoszewski or Kotarbiński that it is worth being decent, and if you do not know what to say, the truth is told. They clearly don't know what to say and they don't want to tell the truth. So the old way: instead of explaining, they attack those who want to explain.
25176	5	Only there is no information vacuum in the net era. If they don't tell the truth, then the void is filled with speculation. So there is information about who poisoned the Oder. I do not repeat because it is not verified. On Wednesday, however, a key question was asked: do you want to hide the perpetrator and reasons for the Odrzan collusion of silence in the Kaczyński camp? If that were the case, the dodges of the current power would gain consistency: they know, but they have a powerful problem, so they lie and matics, play delay, look for catchy replacement topics.
25176	7	Whatever the final findings - poison crime or natural causes, i.e. force majeure - the Odra case also has two positives. First of all, citizens see in what condition under Kaczyński's rule the state is financed from their taxes. Secondly, many Poles and Poles will really open their eyes that they have to take care of nature, because they will not defend itself against the robbery of its resources under the cover of bad rule.
25176	9	Bad governments mock "ecologicalism" like other alleged ideologies of "leftism". That is why Kaczyński ignored the Odra disaster during a trip to Ruda Śląska. He was silent because maybe he knows the truth about her from the beginning. But also not to give the Pisz concrete the impression that the opposition's questions deserve to answer at all. It is the opposite: we want to know why Polish waters are served, why there is no constant monitoring of rivers, what is the idea of ​​the government to save the Oder and to ensure Poland's water safety.
25176	11	The tactic adopted by the Kaczyński camp - a mix of arrogance with manipulation and information regulation - will bear fiasco anyway. Because sooner or later the answers will be known. If it turns out that it was about hiding the truth, voters, even the PiSów, will not give up the topic.
25176	13	Topping that asking questions is non -patriotic is a caricature of constructive parliamentary work. MPs asking specific questions to the rulers behave patriotically. It is non -patriotic to avoid them when the ecological clock is louder and louder.
25176	15	Part two. Golden algae
25176	17	Finally they came up with: these are golden algae, not KGHM with permission from Polish waters or some other large state plant. Natural disaster, as in other European rivers. Get down, Tusk.
25176	19	Only those salts, what about them? Where did they suddenly come from, and the golden algae is fattening on them? Anyway, not their fault, but the "political chutch" of the opposition. And the problem with the head, because PiS writes and climbs while his pirates will not give something. When he has a message that they consider credible, the nerves calm down.
25176	21	Early. There are the first surveys from the inside of the Odrzański confusion. Almost 70 percent believe that the current power is to blame. In the political study, Tusk only divides from Kaczyński, only 2 percent, a statistical error. The trend of a discount for PiS persists. It is probably too late to get to the full truth about the disaster. "Sharity" helped to cover the traces and evidence. But indignation is not so easy to wait.
2518	2	Left convention. Almost all speeches were convinced of compulsory vaccinations
2518	4	Instead of fighting Pandemia, the rulers are fighting for power - Left leaders said at the Saturday convention Włodzimierz Czarzasty and Robert Biedroń. They argued that in the name of maintaining a "fragile majority in the Sejm", the government listens to people who claim that if someone is vaccinated at Covid-19, he has a chip.
2518	6	During the Saturday convention, leftist activists and their doctors, epidemiologists and people who lost their loved ones in Pandemic, convinced the leftist vision of "prescription for Poland", as they called the package of solutions, which - in their opinion - will effectively help you, including local governments, in Fighting the fifth wave of Covid-19 pandemic and overcoming its effects. They also presented proposals for the development of the health care system, including by analing increase in the salary of medical staff.
2518	8	Almost in all speeches, they were convinced to introduce compulsory vaccinations against Covid-19, as co-chairman of the new left, MEP Robert Biedroń summed up, declaring that "mandatory vaccinations are a guarantee of safety for all of us".
2518	10	According to the co-chairman of the new left of Włodzimierz Czarzasty, people who vaccinated against Covid-19 are less likely, and if they get sick, the course of this disease is lighter. At the same time, he referred to statistical data, which shows that vaccinated people die less often, and among those currently hospitalized patients, 90 percent. They are unvaccinated people. "Is there any conclusion from this?" - He was asking. "I have an idea - maybe you need to vaccinate people" - he added.
2518	12	Czarzasty, and earlier other MPs and MPs of the left, reminded that on December 7 last year, their grouping submitted a bill in the Sejm on mandatory but not forced vaccinations. Czarzasty pointed out that from that moment in Poland - as he said - fell ill with Covid -19 over a million people, and 20,000 of them died.
2518	14	Czarzasty argued that in terms of fighting the epidemic, the rulers are not listening to experts or doctors. "Prime Minister, do you know why the doctors left you. Because you do not want to listen to them. And you advised you, many of them, obligatory vaccinations" - said to the head of the government Mateusz Morawiecki. "You listen to madmen, people who think the world is flat, listens to people who think that this flat world lies on the shell of the turtle. You listen to people who say that if someone is vaccinated, he has a chip - Chinese, Russian; that he would behave like a robot, that he would not think that this chip would take his mind out of him, "he added.
2518	16	Deputy Marshal of the Sejm accused the prime minister of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński that "in the name of the Sejm majority, most of the Sejm kill people." Czarzasty also claimed that Morawiecki and Kaczyński only listen to politicians who "have neither knowledge nor reason, but only bad emotions." He pointed to the PiS parliamentary club Anna Maria Siarkowska from the Republican Party several times in such a narrative, recognized in his environment as the leader of "anti -vaccine". "You create a situation that most of the Sejm kills people," repeated Czarzasty.
2518	18	In turn, MEP Biedroń said that Morawiecki and his office decided that "nothing could be done, that Pandemia had to wait", and then referred to the Saturday Congress of European right -wing and conservative parties in Spain.
2518	20	"Today Prime Minister Morawiecki, instead of fighting for the life and health of Poles, meets with pro -Putin, anti -European leaders and leaders. He is not interested in Polish and Poles. He betrayed" - emphasized Biedroń.
2518	22	According to MEP, "in most European countries there have been such security standards for a long time, which is missing in Poland", while the ruling camp in Poland called the party "cannot be".
2518	24	"Covid passports? Prime Minister Morawiecki says +. It is impossible to vaccinate - +it is impossible +, free testing on a massive scale - +cannot be +, privileges for vaccinated and safety for all of us - +it cannot be +. Today With full responsibility, we can say that we are ruled by the +party +. Morawiecki and Kaczyński, which can be seen today at the hand, they can only idle these hands, as if hundreds of dying people every day, Polish women and Poles, nothing for them He did not mean, "Biedroń said.
2518	26	In his opinion, the only thing that interests the ruling camp today is the maintenance of the "fragile majority in the Sejm". "They do it in a brutal way, using bribery, blackmail and wiretap," he calculated. "Instead of fighting Pandemia, they fight for power," said the co -chairman of the new left.
2518	28	"The left wants to say clearly and clearly: we are on the side of life, we will do everything to fight for the health and safety of Polish and Poles," he declared.
2518	30	Biedroń argued that, unlike the current power camp, the left stood up to the challenge. "We put specific things on the table, we have specific proposals for compulsory vaccinations, privileges for vaccinated, covid passports, public health care and ankle salary increase for medical staff," he calculated.
2518	32	At the same time, he appealed "to the entire democratic opposition" for unification "for the health and safety of Polish and the safety of Poles" and the creation of a "coalition for life".
2518	34	"Therefore, I appeal on behalf of the left to the largest opposition party, I appeal to Donald Tusk, to the Civic Coalition, let's stand in one row and together with non -governmental organizations, with trade unions, with all people of good will, we run a law proposed by the left regarding mandatory vaccinations today. Your inaction, or your action, can save human life; this is no longer a political struggle today, this is a fight for the lives of people, Polish women and Poles, "said Robert Biedroń. (PAP)
25181	1	Side effects after Novavax vaccine against Covid-19
25181	3	From March 1, 2022, and therefore less than 2 years from the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) Pandemia Covid-19, Poles have the opportunity to vaccinate the new Novavax vaccine. What makes it stand out? How does it work and what are its side effects?
25181	5	Vaccinations on Covid-19 are widely available since December 2020. Since then, almost 60% of the Polish population has been vaccinated. The fifth vaccine called Novaxovid from Novavax has already been available since March this year. The Minister of Health announced that people over 18 years of age could be vaccinated.
25181	7	Novavax vaccine - composition, action, history of the uprising
25181	9	Until now, coronavirus could be vaccinated with several types of vaccines, which can be divided into 3 groups:
25181	11	- vector - Astra Zeneca, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen,
25181	13	- traditional or protein - Novavax,
25181	15	- MRNA - Moderna, Pfizer & Biontech.
25181	17	The latest of them, Nuvaxovid, is a product of the American biotechnology company Novavax. Interestingly, a few years ago the company was threatened with removal from the stock exchange. This was related to the fact that, despite millions of research expenses, none of the Novavax products met with a favorable opinion of regulatory bodies. The fate of the company was only saved by the Covid-19 vaccine.
25181	19	Nuvaxovid is one of the traditional protein vaccines. Its composition contains an antigen in the form of cleaned protein S (spike) of the SARS-COV-2 virus, as well as an adiuwant of plant origin obtained from the proper soap. Its effectiveness and safety have been proven thanks to clinical trials carried out at 60,000 participants.
25181	21	How does Novavax vaccine work? After the antigen is entered, the immune system recognizes it as a stranger and begins the production of antibodies, as well as T lymphocytes. Thanks to this when the SARS-COV-2 virus begins to infect the body, the immune system will be prepared for this attack. He will recognize foreign protein and launch a cascade of defense processes.
25181	23	Novavax vaccine is administered in two doses, not less than 3 weeks.
25181	25	Contraindications for taking Novavax vaccine
25181	27	Contraindications for vaccination on Covid-19 using NUVAXOVID relate to an anaphylactic reaction to any component. The vaccine can be given to people who have already come to SARS-COV-2 infections.
25181	29	Side effects after Novavax vaccine
25181	31	Side effects after Novavax vaccine are no different from complications after other vaccines. Most often:
25181	33	- tenderness/pain at the puncture site,
25181	35	- muscle pain,
25181	37	- Headache,
25181	39	- generally weakness of the body,
25181	41	- nausea and vomiting,
25181	43	- arthralgia.
25181	45	Most undesirable vaccination reactions (NOP) have a mild character and give way to spontaneously.
25186	1	North Korea: Kim Jong Un announced the victory of the "Socialist regime" over Koronavirus
25186	3	North Korea leader Kim Jong Un announced "victory" in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and ordered the abolition of the sharpest preventive measures introduced in May-the official KCNA press agency said on Thursday.
25186	5	According to Kcn Kim, he stated that the official number of deaths due to an epidemic, of 74 people, "is an unprecedented miracle" compared to other countries.
25186	7	The North Korean leader ordered the abolition of the sharpest moves to prevent the expansion of the epidemic but stated that North Korea must maintain a "strong as steel anti-epidemic barrier and intensify work on combating the epidemic until the end of the global health crisis."
25186	9	Reuter reminds that North Korea has never informed about the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. From July 29, she informed that no new cases were detected, which, according to independent experts, was the result of limited testing options.
25186	11	Nothing is known about vaccination in this country. The authorities reported that the fight against the virus consisted of lockdown, home medicine and - as Kim said - "the advantage of the Korean socialist system."
25186	13	As Kcna Kim, Kim, Kim Jo Dong wrote, revealed that her brother had a high fever. She also accused South Korea of ​​contributing to the outbreak of an epidemic.
25192	1	Will we (when?) Green watermelons in Poland?
25192	3	Once the cultivation of apricot or vine in Poland was marginal and difficult. Today, weather conditions allow it. Will we grow species that are currently "reserved" for the countries of southern Europe?
25192	5	Only a few dozen years ago, apricot cultivation in Poland did not exist on a goods scale. The establishment of numerous apricot orchards in the Sandomierz Basin was allowed by: climate change and growing varieties suitable for Polish soil and climatic conditions. A few years ago, the climate in Sandomierz was like in Hungary in the 70s.
25192	7	However, the climate changes all the time. We also see this on the basis of the development of vine cultivation in Poland, which in the last century did not develop so dynamically. The question remains when the climatic conditions in Poland allow the cultivation of watermelon, kiwi or other species produced today in southern Europe?
25192	9	We will also meet with more "dark" visions of climatologists. Some computer simulations show that the south of Europe in a few hundred years will not be suitable for agricultural production at all, and this will slowly move to the north of the continent.
25192	11	The best example for the above theses are southern Italy. In Calabria, Basilica, Apulia and Sicily, there is talk of climate tropicalization. In the south of the country, interest in growing mango, avocado, papaya or goji berries is growing. Why? Because the growing atmosphere of the south of Italy allows the cultivation of these species.
25192	13	In Apulia (i.e. the so -called Italian heels), exotic cultivation is already 500 hectares. The demand for exotic fruits is also growing in the country. In view of the above, a further increase in planting in this segment is forecast. Climate warming is often considered a conspiracy theory. One thing is certain, the climate has changed, changes and will change. Along with it, conditions for agricultural and gardening production also in Poland.
25194	1	"Hypocrisy". Macron on the fire of criticism after revealing photos from holidays
25194	3	The President of France was recognized by ecologists as eco-hypocritis. Emmanuel Macron was caught driving on a water scooter a few weeks after he called his compatriots to save energy.
25194	5	Last month, Macron appealed to the French nation with a hot appeal that society would get involved in the "Solidarity effort", which aims to protect the environment and rational energy consumption. The French president also ordered ministers to develop plans for "energy savings" to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent. in the next two years.
25194	7	- We need to prepare for a script in which we will have to go completely without Russian gas. This is very likely. We need general mobilization - said Macron during the celebration of the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution.
25194	9	Eco-hypocrisy
25194	11	Macron is known for his worship for water sports, in particular riding on water scooters. Every summer from 2017, the French president was photographed on these vehicles.
25194	13	The photos published this week show Macron, who devotes himself to fun on these vehicles in the Riviera Fort de Brégançon estate, from 1968 the official residence of the Presidents of France. However, this time his riding on water scooters, which consume huge amounts of fuel (from four to even ten times more than the average passenger car), caused indignation among members of the National Assembly.
25194	15	Sandrine Rousseau Green MP said: "This confirms the persistent impression that [Macron - ed. ed.] does not understand climate change. And nowadays it is crime not to understand this. "
25194	17	One of the deputies from the Macron party of La République en Marche told the tabloid "Voici" that he "disbelief" when he saw the president of the president on a scooter.
25194	19	Macron's slip -up
25194	21	However, playing on fuel -eating water scooters is not the only offense that environmentalists accuse the President of France. Recently, Macron posted on Twitter several entries about fires raging in France, which were associated with climate change by many activists.
25194	23	Interestingly, Macron himself said last month that a recent increase in the number of forest fires in Mediterranean countries is "a consequence of climate change."
25194	25	According to activists, the President of France showed hypocrisy indicating the effects of global warming, and by devoting himself to the fun, which consumes huge amounts of fuel.
25195	1	Do they want to move Tusk?
25195	3	In the management of the PO, the idea of ​​removing Donald Tusk from party leadership begins to mature and during the election campaign the leaders of the future coalition would enter his place: Rafał Trzaskowski, Szymon Hołownia and Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. As the former head of PO Grzegorz Schetyna says: "The idea is interesting because it integrates opposition environments (...). He would have to be built by the communist or agreement with the opposition. "
25195	5	The disclosure of such plans indicates Tusk's weakening position, because public discussion of such a scenario would not have met with serious consequences not so long ago, including throwing out of the party. One thing is certain, Tusk's return did not cause an increase in quotations, on the contrary - a slight decline. Social Changes survey a few days ago shows that KO could count on 25.4 percent. support, and the united right at 39 percent This result does not satisfy Tusk's supporters, on the contrary - it causes an increase in dissatisfaction. But it is not surprising, his embarrassing statements compromise him and the party he represents. This slowly reaches supporters of the opposition, maybe that's why Schetyna revealed the plans that are talked about in the opposition environment.
2527	1	Korwin-Mikke: Putting sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity
2527	3	Sooner Russia will handle without gold than we can do without gas. Really imposing sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity-says the confederation MP and the president of the Korwin party Janusz Korwin-Mikke in an interview with the portal Dorzeczy.pl.
2527	5	Dorzeczy.pl: Russia turned the gas tap to Poland because our country did not agree to make payments for raw material in rubles. The president criticized the Polish government's decision. Why?
2527	7	Janusz Korwin-Mikke: I criticize Russia first, which once turns, then unscrews the gas tap. On the Russian side, we have a situation of decision fever, which can be seen after the whole war after it is waged. There is clearly wrong in Russia, but this does not change the fact that our government has fooling around, giving up Russian gas and oil. In that case, since they turned our tap, we should be happy.
2527	9	The government says we are prepared for it. We only need to be ready to increase the price.
2527	11	I have always explained that sanctions work on both sides. On the one hand, of course, the Russians stop getting money, but on the other we stop receiving gas. Sooner Russia will handle without gold than we can do without gas. Really imposing sanctions on Russia is a complete absurdity.
2527	13	Why?
2527	15	We say that we do not want to have anything to do with Russia, we do not get gas and we wonder what now. Western countries impose numerous sanctions on Russia, but they want gas. Isn't that absurd?
2527	17	In that case, how to punish Russia for the situation in Ukraine?
2527	19	Wait a minute, but why punish? Can we even punish other countries for their actions? After all, we are not some international tribunal that will punish Russia or Ukraine, or maybe China. For example, we can be offended to the United States for their actions. This is not done and the economy is not mixed for politics.
2527	21	But there is war, we are dealing with genocide.
2527	23	Let's say something clear. I say that Włodzimierz Putin has committed a war crime, because according to the Haska convention, one must not attack another state without declaring him war. However, the war is not a crime. It is a normal means of resolving conflicts. The whole history of Europe is full of wars. We do not call Alexander Macedonian a war criminal although more people were killed during his wars than during the Russian-Ukrainian war. We do not call Napoleon's criminals, Stefan Batory or other leaders.
2527	25	You mentioned that the war is strangely waged. So how?
2527	27	Russia began with the shooting of Kiev and Kharkov, which is a complete nonsense. In addition, civilians must not be fired. The war is waged among themselves, not civilians. The fact that Russia fired on and excluded all Ukrainian aviation on the first day, we are dealing with war with you. However, shooting civilians and bombing of cities should definitely be condemned.
2527	29	And let's not mix the economy in it anyway?
2527	31	Of course. If we want this, let's declare the war of Russia.
2527	33	War?
2527	35	Yes. After all, in Poland, there is a thesis that Ukraine is able to win a war with Russia. Poland is a country with similar potential. Apparently we also have an excellent, well -armed army. If this is true, then please: let's declare war on Russia and together with Ukraine we will definitely defeat it. This is a reasonable action.
2527	37	Will the economic costs of war for the whole world in your assessment?
2527	39	I do not understand. After all, if two countries are fighting, everyone else earns on it. They provide weapons to both sides, equipment, etc. never lose neighboring countries.
2527	41	But citizens are losing the economy due to high inflation.
2527	43	Thanks to these idiotic sanctions, Americans support India and China, which get cheap gas and oil, because they sell them at a promotional price raw materials Russians. That is why I think that we should also buy gas from Russia. Let's not mix the economy with the war, as we do not mix politics and sport. I grew up during communism. When our athletes did not go to the Olympics to Los Angeles for political reasons, then everyone protested. Today, however, sport with politics is mixed ...
2527	45	How do you think the war in Ukraine will end?
2527	47	I have no idea. My first reaction on February 24 was the thought that Włodzimierz Putin was crazy. Therefore, you can't predict what will happen next.
2527	49	During the authorization of the conversation, Janusz Korwin-Mikke sent a post scriptum: "min. Foreign Affairs of the UK has just admitted that the kingdom has long armed Ukraine and trained its soldiers. Similarly, USA and Canada. In that case, I change my mind about this "madness": Russia should have put Ukraine an ultimatum just 5 years ago. "
2528	1	Russia can avoid bankruptcy. The western machine of imposing sanctions clearly fierce
2528	3	It is not certain whether current sanctions are enough to overthrow Vladimir Putin. But to convince the Union to new Joe Biden it will be very difficult.
2528	5	At the threshold of the second month of the war in Ukraine, the western machine of imposing penalties on Russia clearly fierce. After four rounds of restrictions coordinated by America, Union and Great Britain, there are no new initiatives yet. And this despite the fact that participation in Brussels Joe Biden at the EU and NATO peak would be a great opportunity to announce them.
2528	7	From the beginning, the American president put the matter clearly: the United States will not take a direct participation in the Ukrainian war. That is why, apart from providing weapons to Ukrainians, unprecedented sanctions have always been the US main tool to defeat the Kremlin. It was about raising the price of the invasion for Vladimir Putin and more broadly Russian society so that they would decide to overthrow the dictator or at least make him to stop fighting.
2528	9	Decline, but not a drama
2528	11	Did it succeed? Diplomatic sources recommend patience. In their opinion, it is only in April that restrictions imposed by the West will be fully felt for the Russians.
2528	13	After all, Goldman Sachs announced his assessment of the effects of the strategy forced by Biden. Her image is mixed. The bank expects that this year the country's national income will break down by 10 percent. That's what during the crisis in 1998, which forced Boris Yeltsin to leave and opened the way to power for Putin. Even in the middle of the financial crisis in 2009, the recession (7.8 percent) was shallower.
2528	15	However, in those cases it was about purely economic breakdown without a conflict, which could unite the Russians around power. Will Russian public opinion be ready to sacrifice in the name of rebuilding the Empire, it is not known. For now, 58 percent respondents support the war, and 23 percent He is against her. The huge role in this role is played by the Kremlin propaganda machine, which does not allow the Russians to learn about the truth, e.g. on the number of victims among Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. This, however, will sooner or later come to light, as is the economic costs of the invasion.
2528	17	The latter, however, may be smaller than expected. Goldman Sachs admits that Russia will rather avoid uncontrolled bankruptcy. This is because he uses raw material prices caused by the war, primarily energy carriers. Therefore, according to the bank, even this year, Moscow will keep the current account surplus, which will allow her to loosen currency restrictions (ban on exporting more than USD 5,000). The Central Bank will probably also be able to keep some control over the ruble course. Goldman Sachs expects 20 % inflation. This is a lot, but not enough for prices to get out of control.
2528	19	On Monday, Wołodymyr Zelanski appealed to the West to do more. He encouraged the Union to follow in the footsteps of the US and Great Britain, which introduced the embargo to the import of Russian oil. More: the Ukrainian president forced the suspension of all trade with Russia and closing for its European ports.
2528	22	Chemical weapon
2528	24	It is doubtful, however, that it would happen, at least for now. Poland, the Baltic States, Denmark and Ireland belong to a small group of Union countries that are in favor of suspending the imports of Russian oil, but Germany is firmly opposite to this. Berlin's opposition considers a good excuse to reduce the costs of sanctions a number of other community countries, such as Italy and France. And when it comes to complete suspension of trade with Russia, Mateusz Morawiecki did not manage to convince even a key partner from the region: the Czech Republic.
2528	26	Germany is afraid that further, forced exacerbation of sanctions will push the West into a deep economic crisis, including due to a rapid increase in energy carriers. The US caution comes from something different. Before departing to Europe, President Biden warned allies that Putin could grow up for chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine with an increasing probability. This would be evidenced by the Kremlin's allegations that the Ukrainians are running the chemical weapon program with the support of the Americans: a good excuse to use this forbidden weapon themselves.
2528	28	The White House is afraid that the increasingly desperate situation on the front of Putin will decide on uncontrolled movements. In this context, maybe imposing sanctions on Russia should be gradual - diplomats wonder.
2528	30	The signal of growing frustration in Moscow is also a call to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the American ambassador John Sullivan. He heard that Russia's diplomatic relations with the United States are "at the threshold of breaking up" because of the name of Biden Putin last week.
2528	32	- A country that is moved by such a term, and at the same time permanently allowed mass slaughter on civilians, cannot be taken seriously - pointed out the spokesman for the Department of State Ned Price. The US established diplomatic relations with the USSR in 1933 and never broke them.
2530	1	Gas and oil embargo from Russia? Unambiguous position of Le Pen
2530	3	Marine Le Pen, the rival of Emmanuel Macron in the race for the chair of the President of France, declared that she strongly supports all sanctions for Russia, except for those regarding oil and gas embargo.
2530	5	During a recent interview for France Inter Radio Le Pen, which in two weeks in the second round of elections will compete with the incumbent president for the highest office in the state, she said that she did not want "the French to suffer the consequences of the embargo" for Russian oil and gas.
2530	7	France, like many other European countries, imports most of its natural gas with pipelines from Russia, using it for energy production for housing and commercial purposes.
2530	9	I am absolutely after all other sanctions - declared Le Pen. The candidate of the National Union met with criticism for her words. In turn, during the election campaign, her political opponents pointed out her too close relations with Russia during the war in Ukraine.
2530	11	Allegations of pro -Russianness
2530	13	Earlier, the leader of ZNA seemed to support the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and in 2017 she called for the abolition of international sanctions in this matter.
2530	15	In 2014, when Crimea was annexed by Russia, her political party received a loan from a Russian bank.
2530	17	Marine Le Pen justified her position on the annexation of Crimea by the statement that Russia's activities at the time were a "different situation" than the current invasion of Ukraine and presented her support for Putin as reflecting her wider ambitions regarding the "multi -seagon" world.
2530	19	Despite the softening of his position on the abandonment of the European Union and other nationalist issues in recent years, he still meets the widespread opposition of the majority of the French political establishment.
2530	21	Former President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on Tuesday publicly that he would vote for his party's rival, Emmanuel Macron and encouraged others to do so.
2537	1	"Live and let others live." Why are trying to reduce meat consumption such emotions?
2537	3	Over 8 percent Poles are on a vegan or vegetarian diet. Meanwhile, the Polish Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda advertises meat, and MEP Sylwia Spurek wants to promote veganism. What next with meat on our plates?
2537	5	Voices in the discussion on limiting the consumption of meat refer to various issues - from fears about the future of farmers and restriction of free choice after climate aspects or the good of animals.
2537	7	The European Union, on the other hand, wants to achieve climatic goals, including by reducing the consumption of red meat among the inhabitants of the community, but does not stop promoting it.
2537	9	Schools without meat
2537	11	Gregory Doucet, representing the Green Party of the Mayor of Lyon, decided last week that the range of canteens in municipal schools would not take into account meat meals. Gerald Darmanin, the Minister of the Interior of France, called this decision "unacceptable insult" for French farmers, and Minister of Agriculture Julien Denormandie asked not to "impose ideology on children's plates."
2537	13	However, as the mayor said-the most important argument was not imposing a vegan diet to students, but to improve the service during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, his predecessor from the right -wing party was to apply the same solutions at the beginning of the crisis.
2537	15	Although in Lyon temporary restrictions led to the indignation of some groups - including farmers' protests - there are schools where students have not eaten meat products for many years. In 2015, a private Muse from California became the first educational institution in the United States, in which the canteen menu consisted of meals based only on plant products.
2537	17	Initially, parents of almost half of the students moved their children to other schools for fear of their health. The school headmaster in an interview with the Guardian daily said that in the case of such decisions one should expect a supporting confrontation - as he said - not with facts, but disinformation.
2537	19	However, school vegetarianism is not new. Already at the beginning of the 20th century, the ST Christopher school was established in Great Britain. One of the principles on which the founders based its functioning was respect for "all breeds and religions" and vegetarianism.
2537	21	Tolerance for all denominations - but also people with various health conditions regarding the diet - was one of the three arguments of the British director Swan School, where students only have access to vegetarian dishes. The positives Kay Wood also included the opportunity to provide "better quality meals for the same money" and greater benefits for the environment.
2537	23	Similar proposals were presented two years ago by councilors of the Warsaw district of Ochota - Sylwia Mróz, Agata Solecka and Anita Szymańska, and councilor Marek Szolc also appealed to the President of Warsaw Rafał Trzaskowski. A common element of the initiatives was the introduction of vegetarian meals' day in the capital's schools, so that, above all, vegans and vegetarians do not feel discriminated.
2537	25	The authorities of both the district and the city replied that such decisions belong to parents, and in some Warsaw institutions students can choose between meat and meatless dishes.
2537	27	At the same time, Warsaw in 2019 was in the 6th place in the ranking of the most vegan -friendly cities in the world - next to, among others London, New York and Berlin. This classification was prepared by the HappyCow portal, which creates guides to vegan places open to vegan cuisine. As it was written, the Polish capital has a wide range of easily accessible restaurants offering a vegan menu.
2537	29	Recommendations, bans or incentives?
2537	31	The dispute about who should decide about the eating habits also applies to the proposals of MEP Sylwia Spurek. A member of the European Parliament presented a plan entitled "Five for the plant industry", which assumes, among others Introducing a ban on meat, milk and eggs, establishing a vegan promotion fund and supplementing education programs - from kindergarten - for climate and animal rights classes.
2537	33	As Sylwia Spurek said in an interview with euractiv.pl, her idea "is only the beginning of the debate about changes that a modern agricultural industry must undergo. These will be big changes because they apply to millions of citizens of the European Union. " "I think that the role of politicians and politicians at such a special moment is to move the boundaries of the debate and introduce important topics to it," added our interlocutor.
2537	35	The public debate on this initiative focuses on two mainstles. The first is represented by people who believe that consuming products of animal origin is healthy, and bans in this area are too much interference in the lifestyle of citizens and can additionally affect Polish farmers.
2537	37	On the other side there are supporters of exclusion of meat from diets - they consider the proposals and arguments of the Euro -Parliamentary as obvious and natural. They also predict that as time passed, more and more Polish women and Poles will find out to leave animal products.
2537	39	Extreme emotions are often a characteristic factor for every discussion on consuming meat and veganism. Sociologist Jan Rückert-John in an interview with Deutsche Welle attempted to explain intensive reactions in response to proposals for systemic reducing meat consumption and noted that "nutrition is perceived as one of the last privacy refuge, in which no one has the right to interfere." And meat is an important element of this sphere, because it is in addition a determinant of prosperity.
2537	41	Sylwia Spurek also notices a similar trend in the attitude of society to change habits. "The legal order to fasten the belts in the car, a ban on smoking in public places, and even a ban on the use of bodily punishment towards children. But as history showed, the introduction of these prohibitions to legal systems also had an educational dimension, changed the way of thinking about security, health, human rights " - emphasized MEP.
2537	43	According to the report, we plant from 2019. In Poland, interest in plant cuisine actually increases. In the analyzed period, 8.4 percent Poles were on a vegan or vegetarian diet, and 3.8 percent decided to limit meat dishes to fish. Preferably from meat - as analyzed - they give up young people aged 18 to 24.
2537	45	Fast food networks are increasingly convinced to the plant menu. McDonald’s signed an agreement with the American company Beyond Meat, dealing with the development of vegan meat substitutes. The first result of cooperation this year is a burger called McPlant. However, for two years, British kfc customers can buy "The Imposter" burger. The product resembles a traditional burger, but its chop is made of quorn - a fungal substitute for meat. We will not see such in Poland, but we will find a vegetarian sandwich in the fastfood menu - with Halloi cheese. We will also buy vegan burgers in most chain grocery stores - from Biedronka, through Lidl, to Żabka.
2537	47	Ideology or strategy supported by facts?
2537	49	There is a widespread belief that - as the Minister of Agriculture Grzegorz Puda wrote on Twitter - "meat, milk, dairy products are full of valuable nutrients." In turn, Sylwia Spurek indicates that "we have a lot of knowledge about the correlation of milk and dairy products with Parkinson's disease, prostate cancer and breast cancer."
2537	51	The EAT commission operating at the Lancet scientific journal, which considers the ways of eating in the context of both ecology and health, explains that "a healthy diet [...] consists of mostly of various products of plant origin and a small amount of animal products."
2537	53	To adapt people's habits to the optimal scale - according to Lancet specialists - diet, it should be half the consumption of plant products and reduce the consumption of animal products by half (here, next to meat, dairy products and eggs are included).
2537	55	If there were a widespread change in eating habits - in accordance with the estimates - up to 11 million people a year would have a chance for a longer life. Although some researchers do not agree that the removal of meat - especially red - has a significant impact on the improvement of health. In 2015, the World Health Organization decided that excessive consumption of meat products could cause cancer.
2537	57	At the beginning of 2020, the European Greenpeace branch announced that to limit the contribution of agriculture to negative climate effects, meat consumption in the European Union must fall by 71 percent. until 2030 and by 81 percent by 2050 (in relation to FAO data from 2017 presented below).
2537	59	According to the creators of the Portal Science about the atmosphere, the so -called A long shadow of breeding, which includes "greenhouse gas emissions from cattle digestive systems", but also - constituting the majority - those associated with the implementation of the supply chain or maneuvering areas to produce animal feed on them.
2537	61	European Union for health, climate and meat producers
2537	63	In recent years, European institutions have often financed meat promotional campaigns. In 2015, the project "Tasty, from Europe" started. Its purpose was to increase the attractiveness of European agricultural products in the EU and third countries. As part of this program, financing their promotion was to increase "from EUR 61 million in 2013 to EUR 200 million in 2019". A large part of the funds went to the meat industry.
2537	65	For example, in 2016, the Pork Lovers Europe project was approved to promote pork. Its authors pointed out that the consumption of this type of meat in the EU fell from 2008 to 2015 by 0.8 kg per capita (from 41.7 kg to 40.9 kg respectively). They also emphasized that "it is important to promote pork and restore consumers with confidence," which could be shaken by, for example, a WHO report on meat carcinogenicity.
2537	67	However, in 2019, the PROUD of EU Beef campaign began, which was prepared for advertising spots, encouraging to eat beef under the slogan "Become a Beefatarian". The creators of the strategy explained that there is a need to improve their opinions about red meat, because consumers give up its purchase because of "various types of information presented recently".
2537	69	According to critics, the promotion of meat is a denial of EU climate and health goals - that is, "from field to table" and "European Cancer Plan", in which the importance of taking into account fewer animal products in the diet is confirmed.
2537	71	Sylwia Spurek points out that EU institutions not only promote animal products, but also do not support the plant industry. "The largest plant startups are created overseas, not in Europe. If the European Union has the ambition to be the leader of the Green Transformation, it cannot further put on meat and milk. He must focus on the development of the plant industry ", which is why, according to the MEP, you need" funds for supporting research and development of such an industry. "
2537	73	"For me it is obvious that, along with the necessary reduction of the demand for meat and milk, we must provide access to alternatives for these products. Step by step, products that harm and in their place must disappear from the shelves - products that are climate -friendly, created with biodiversity and ethical. Unfortunately, in this matter, the European Commission seems to be paralyzed by fear of the opinion of a great lobby, "summed up the EU activities of the European Parliamentary.
2537	75	How much meat do we eat?
2537	77	According to the analysis of the Our World in Data, carried out on the basis of the data of the United Nations for food and agriculture (FAO), in 2017 the Spaniards consumed the most meat in the EU - 100.25 kg per person per year.
2537	79	Portugal (94.06 kg) came second, followed by Poland (88.7 kg) and Germany (87.78 kg). At the end of the EU list were Bulgarians (58.31 kg) and Slovaks (59.34 kg).
2537	81	For comparison, the largest amount of meat consumed on a global scale is over 120 kg (in this group there is e.g. Hong Kong, the United States, Australia), and the lowest results - e.g. in India, Bangladesh or Ethiopia - do not exceed 5 kg.
2537	83	According to the creators of the consumption of meat, the consumption of meat is largest in high -income countries, and the average of global meat consumption has increased by about 20 kg since 1961. However, two years ago, meat production fell, and the trend remained in a pandemic year.
2537	85	One of the most important examples of the influence of Covid-19 pandemic on meat consumption is Argentina, famous for beef steaks, where in 2020 you had to pay up to four times more than three years earlier for meat products.
2537	87	The minimum wage of the Argentineans also fell, and therefore they could buy fewer such products. In this way, one of the lowest levels of meat consumption in the history of the South American state was achieved.
2537	89	This is a paradox because Argentina - as El País writes - belongs to the world's largest beef producers. Last year, the country sold a record amount of beef abroad throughout the history - 900,000 tons worth 2.7 billion. hole. It's 6.5 percent More than in 2019, results from the data of the Chamber of Industry and Meat Trade (CICCRA). Most go to China.
2546	1	The war covers the plans of evil globalists? This is a conspiracy theory!
2546	3	Fake news in a nutshell
2546	5	A short film appeared on Facebook, in which it was convinced that the Russian invasion of Ukraine aims to divert the attention of people from world elite conspiracy, which through a pandemic treaty try to take power over the world and take away civic freedoms.
2546	7	The Pandemic Treaty is not an intricate and evil plan of unspecified world elites, and the intentions of its creation have been known since 2020. Its purpose is to develop mechanisms that will allow you to prevent and counteract future pandems.
2546	9	From one of the films widespread on Facebook, we will learn that the currently ongoing war in Eastern Europe was a planned action of unspecified global elites. Its purpose is to be to divert the attention of the whole world from the warfare introduced under the lid to ensure the enslavement of humanity. War in Ukraine is a real problem. People die during armed attacks. On the recording, however, it was convinced that "this is not a war on the Russia line versus Ukraine or the USA versus China. Only on the line degenerated self -proclaimed global elite versus the whole world population "(recording time 03:05). Such a conclusion was made on the basis of a few false information that was distributed on the network. He has no support in the facts.
2546	11	Treaty on prevention and pandemic readiness. Will WHO take power over the world?
2546	13	At the recording presenting the conspiracy theory, we hear that: "On the days the first meeting of the intergovernmental negotiation body is to be held in Geneva regarding the signing of the International Treaty of Pandemic Prevention and Readiness, which will permanently deprive 194 member countries of any decision and financial sovereignty in the area of ​​health policy for WHO "(Recording time 00:45). What really is the international treaty on prevention and pandemic readiness? From December 1, 2021, work is underway to develop a "convention, contract or other international instrument that would be a legally binding act of international law."
2546	15	The idea itself, however, reaches 2020, when no one knew what could happen after two years, which we wrote in one of our recent analyzes.
2546	17	As we can read on the European Commission website: "The instrument would be set out in the goals and basic principles that would organize a joint, necessary fight with Pandems." So this is not an idea that should be afraid.
2546	19	Scientists support the plan to create joint recommendations
2546	21	According to scientific environments, developing such solutions is needed in the face of progressive globalization and related pandemic threats. The world of science is aware that in the future there will also be further pandemia. Developing a treaty would enable the implementation of a number of benefits that could be transformed into effective prevention and fighting threats.
2546	23	Information about the receipt of sovereignty and civil rights is false
2546	25	Later in the film, it was stated that: "If the treaty is signed (...) from now on, all decisions and WHO ordinances will be considered superior and binding to the Member States, which will open the gate to introduce a total digital control over the global population under the pretext of health protection ( ...) "(recording time 01:15). This would allegedly lead to global censorship and public control. However, there are no reasons that would indicate that the introduction of the treaty would allow to collect the sovereignty of countries in the field of health policy. The introduction of a treaty would allow cooperation against future pandems, which is noted by representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO).
2546	27	"Pandemia Covid-19 shed light on many disadvantages of the global system of people's protection against Pandemic: the most defenseless people who do not have vaccines, healthcare workers without necessary equipment to perform life-saving work and the" first I "approach, which inhibits global solidarity necessary for dealing with a global threat. " Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, CEO of WHO
2546	29	Contrary to conspiracy theories, these are not solutions that would have to enslave people or act to the detriment of a global population. On the contrary, thanks to this - according to the will of the initiators - it could be more effective to coordinate cooperation on the international arena, while maintaining the principles of solidarity, justice, inclusiveness and transparency.
2546	31	Nevertheless, at the moment it is not possible to assess what shape the treaty will take in the final version, because it has not yet been developed. Therefore, suggestions regarding the loss of the sovereignty of countries in favor of WHO have no justification and support in previous findings, remaining contradictory with the basic assumptions of the initiators.
2546	33	Receiving freedom by vaccination - how much is the truth?
2546	35	The premises that were treated as evidence of the existence of a conspiracy was the belief that compulsory Covid-19 vaccinations would soon be introduced in Poland. As we hear on the recording: "In Poland, the draft act on the compulsion of vaccination and covenic passports" (recording time 00:15) has just been received. In groups that were covered by compulsory Covid-19 vaccinations, there were people practicing a medical profession, pharmacists, medical students and employees of medical entities.
2546	37	Ideas to introduce compulsory vaccinations for all Poles have been considered for a long time, but so far such solutions have not been developed, and the Sejm works carried out on them have not ended. Therefore, it is not known what the final version of the Act will look like.
2546	39	Foreign troops in Poland will take us sovereignty?
2546	41	Further, recipients are convinced that Poland consciously reflects its sovereignty in favor of a global conspiracy. As we hear: "A few days ago, the president signed a document giving foreign troops green light to use firearms and other means of direct coercion towards Poles" (recording time 00:20).
2546	43	In turn, allied troops in Poland - as some disinformation messages said - did not receive police powers, which you can read more about in one of the analyzes we published.
2546	45	In connection with the tense situation in Eastern Europe, selected departments stationed in Poland can use weapons or means of direct coercion only in strictly defined situations that are related to the risk of health, life or property.
2546	47	Summary
2546	49	Conspiracy theories are based on the assumption that powerful forces operating in hiding are behind harmful and tragic events (they do not necessarily have to be "world elites"). These, however, have the fact that they are not based on any reliable evidence and very - simply sloppy - they generalize reality. They are based on the conviction of the existence of a hidden truth, to which only a few have access, and also simplify the complexity of serious events in a zero-one, presenting reality as if it was a battlefield of good with evil.
2549	1	PiS has plans for Ukraine. It is even about the creation of the "union" of both countries
2549	3	Currently, the border with Poland has exceeded more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees. According to research from the end of March, every fourth Ukrainian refugee plans to stay in Poland, even when the war is over. To this, however, should be added to 2.5 million Ukrainian immigrants who were in Poland before February 24, as well as more millions who, due to the difficult economic situation in Ukraine, will undoubtedly come to Poland.
2549	5	PiS has taken action to show everyone how necessary to help Ukrainians coming to Poland. On the occasion of the crisis on the border with Belarus, a different position was held. Why? Because Polish power did not realize how to use newcomers from the Middle East and Africa. Now PiS knows how to settle this matter in its own interest.
2549	7	First, in a short term, the government adopted a special act enabling Ukrainians access to the labor market, health care and education system. In addition, they received access to the PESEL system, places in schools and kindergartens. Even Polish citizens never had such privileges. Expenses for the maintenance of Ukrainian refugees are from PLN 2 to 3 billion every month. However, the Polish government justifies to throwing money to the possibility of staying in power for the next years.
2549	9	What's more, in recent weeks, Warsaw announces the reception of far -reaching cooperation declarations. There was even information about the creation of the "Union" of both countries. In these circumstances, the question arises why PiS decided on such actions.
2549	11	The most obvious answer is that because it is the need for a moment that it requires the reason for the state. However, it is more likely that PiS is hoping that helping Ukrainians will gain social support for them. Currently, PiS sees millions of faithful voters in Ukrainians who will repay for help at the urns.
2549	13	PiS political fantasy about the use of Ukrainians in the Polish political system looks very interesting. First of all, it is planned to give Ukrainians voting in the national elections (parliamentary in 2023, presidential in 2025), which requires Polish citizenship. They can be obtained by recognition, which is associated with the need to meet certain conditions - in particular a few years of stay in Poland and knowledge of the language or by giving the president. However, the president is not limited by any conditions and can give Polish citizenship to every foreigner. This solution will gain PiS potential gratitude to new Polish-Ukrainian citizens.
2549	15	In the case of local elections, the situation is simpler. In the European Union, citizens who have a place of residence in a Member State, of which they are citizens, have the right to vote in local elections in this country. In addition, some countries - e.g. Scandinavian - have granted the right to vote in local elections, under certain conditions, also living there to citizens of non -venified countries. Poland may grant such a right to refugees from Ukraine in the following months. This only requires a change in the local government electoral law.
2549	17	Warsaw transmits weapons and urges Kyiv for aggressive steps. However, the most important thing that the Polish government wants is the demolition of Ukraine. As a result, Warsaw will gain both Earth and new grateful voters. And only then will PiS be able to justify multi -billion expenses and maintain power. However, if something goes wrong, difficult and dangerous times await Poland.
2556	1	End of love for Ukrainians?
2556	3	Since a few weeks we have been observing a clear change in the attitude of Poles towards refugees and migrants from Ukraine. The initial euphoria and the explosion of altruism have now been replaced by a much more pragmatic, "life" approach to the question. Interesting information in this area was brought by a recent survey conducted by IBRIS for the Rzeczpospolita daily.
2556	5	As many as seven out of ten respondents want refugees from Ukraine to stay in Poland, but on condition that they take up work and stay on their own. The second place among the conditions is the education of children at a Polish school, and the third of the Polish language learning.
2556	7	Behind the Ukrainians to make specific conditions of stay in Poland, 76 percent are opt for. Men, most in the range of 30-39 years (up to 83%), mainly living in large and smaller cities - 90%and 82%. Up to 97%. respondents are family fathers - with at least two children.
2556	9	As "Rzeczpospolita" indicates, the IBRIS survey corresponds to the research that the University of Warsaw recently conducted under the direction of Dr. Robert Staniszewski. It resulted from them that most Poles, although very favorable to Ukrainians, were against granting 500+ benefits in Poland and social benefits.
2556	11	The expectations of Poles apparently noted the government, which from July 1 no longer want to finance accommodation and meals for Ukrainian refugees and migrants. This is to become independent of Ukrainians. Meanwhile, until May 23 this year, 160 thousand found legal employment. newly arrived citizens of Ukraine. This is not even 30% of the population of refugees and migrants of a new wave in working age.
2556	13	So you can say that it happened exactly what we predicted (and published in Polish thought) several months ago. We predicted that although Poles will still be fundamentally favorable to Ukrainians, the feelings will gradually become clearly cool. We predicted that we would soon realize that we are paying for the generosity of the government. That is why we will be more and more opposed to distributing 500+ to Ukrainians and other social benefits. The more that the economic situation in the sacred of our home budgets and throughout the whole country will be more and more difficult month to month.
2556	15	This is already happening. But that's not the end. National antagonisms will intensify with the growing of the economic crisis. The more that the long -term conflict leads to natural fatigue and burnout of empathy. This fall, the first serious tensions will appear.
2556	17	It is a pity that instead of listening to friendly warnings, the rulers preferred to focus in recent months on silencing the opposition and stigmatizing it as "Ruthenian onuc". We could avoid many expensive mistakes together. Meanwhile, we will soon have to pay a salty bill for the disinvolture of Mr. Kaczyński and Morawiecki. And no spells like "Слава україні!" They won't change this fact.
2558	1	Dmitry Muratow sold the Nobel medal for $ 103.5 million
2558	3	In the conditions of war, it is possible and necessary to remain a decent man, not the face from the band "Friends of Putin". "Putin's friends", even living in democratic countries, declare "weakness" of this form of rule and dream of a "strong hand" or "new world order". Dmitry Muratov's deed should become an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, mostly both undecided about the war in Ukraine.
2558	5	The medal of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 2021, the editor -in -chief of "Nowa Gazieta» Dmitry Muratowa, was sold at auction in the United States for $ 103 and a half million dollars. This was reported on the website of the "Heritage Auctions" American department store, which conducted the auction. The buyer's name is unknown.
2558	7	The entire income from the sale of the prize will be transferred to the United Nations Fund for children (UNICEF) to help Ukrainian juvenile refugees and their families. The auction took place on the occasion of World Refugee Day, which is celebrated on June 20.
2558	9	This deed is an example for Russian and Western intellectuals, mostly undecided about the war in Ukraine.
2558	11	The phenomenon of intellectual support for Russian fascism / parallel with Nazi Germany. Intellectuals perceive totalitarian regimes as an opportunity for a "new order".
2558	13	Russia is based not only on a powerful propaganda machine, but also on intellectuals in many countries of the world.
2558	15	The reasons for this phenomenon are generous payment of "work" by conditional Gazprom, nostalgia for emigration, revolutionary hobby of left -wing radical persuasion (especially in Latin America), covering great Russian culture, etc.
2558	17	All this led to the fact that everything "non -Russian", existing over the space of the former USSR, ceased to be seen at all. Russia is currently implementing this idea in relation to its national periphery, as well as Central Asia countries, namely the former republics of the USSR.
2558	19	In this and there is a fundamental mistake of Russia in Ukraine and its misunderstanding for the Baltic States. Russian coaches, sharpened for the implementation of imperial ambitions, dream of the Russian Empire 2.0 as a "Russian Empire". And that is why all attempts to join the former zone of influence to other unions/ initiatives - EU, Three Seas, etc. - are so sensitively perceived.
2558	21	The time has come for European intellectuals to start perceiving countries from the orbit of the former USSR, i.e. Ukraine, Kazakhstan as independent and active players.
2559	1	The deportation of Ukrainians to Russia takes a terrible momentum
2559	3	Since the beginning of the war against Ukraine on a full -scale Russian army, in addition to all possible crimes against humanity, they carry out a mass deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation using violence. The exact number of deported people is unknown, because most such cases are made in occupied territories, but are estimated from 800,000 to 1.5 million people, among whom about 300,000 are children.
2559	5	Putin considers the issue of Ukraine's occupation in a systematic and comprehensive way. The human factor is one of the most important factors and is of particular importance to Russia. Removing Ukrainians (mainly in the young, reproductive and productive age), Putin thus arranges the demographic problem of Russia, which took the catastrophic size in 2021-2022, and is especially important for the long, poor regions of Russia, which become uninhabited, and in some places The lack of hands to work is felt. The President of the Russian Federation specially signed the Act on forced resettlement of over 100,000 deported Ukrainians to Siberia and for the Arctic Circle, as well as giving them Russian citizenship in an accelerated mode. Like Stalin, he forcibly deported Ukrainians in the 1930s-40s, using their work as a locomotive to create housing and industrial infrastructure in the USSR, so the Russian dictator plans to use Ukrainians as legal slaves in the most difficult regions.
2559	7	At the same time, Putin leaves Ukraine without human resources. According to his concept, Ukrainians should either be eliminated or resettled (actually remain the exiles of their own country) to the final resolution of the Ukrainian issue. The option of transferring Ukrainians to Europe is not the right solution for Russia, because Ukrainian refugees can return and become a serious problem for Russia. Russian propaganda is so effective that an alternative understanding of the situation about the causes and sense of the current Russian-Ukrainian war, understanding in the spirit of the Kremlin's political narrative, may arise in the Ukrainians. And in the event of their return to Ukraine, these people will reflect the concepts needed by Putin for Ukrainian recipients.
2559	9	In this way, the deportation of Ukrainians to the Russian Federation immediately dealt with two issues and takes on a dangerous character. Ukrainians are taken to the Russian Federation by the way of so -called "green corridors" to peacefully evacuate civilians. So, only 15,000 inhabitants were taken from Mariupol to Rostów on March 24, on March 24. People are exported to filtering camps for taganrog or to Rostov for the next redirect to Siberia, the Far East and for the Arctic Circle. Russia fully violates the Geneva conventions about the treatment of civilians and actually dictates its conditions for Ukrainians in the occupied territories. Displaced people are left without documents, in return they get a job and a flat. Their return to Ukraine is too heavy and complicated, requires the participation of third countries to help to cross the border.
2559	11	Putin tries to give this war a long -term, tiring and exhausting character for Ukraine, which is achieved not only on the battlefield, but also with the help of other hybrid war tools. Forced deportation is one of the variants of the genocide in Ukrainians: the Russian totalitarian state of the Ukrainians from their homeland, just like the Ottoman Empire in the last years of its reign, resettled and expelled the Anatolian Greeks. Putin created a huge geopolitical, ethnographic and social disaster of the 21st century, which is exaggerated every day of this war.
2560	1	Ukraine is not worth the nuclear war
2560	3	Kiev friends in Poland propose Armageddon.
2560	5	As Russia is making slow progress in heavy fights in east of Ukraine, it is increasingly talking about an impasse, and maybe even a possible Russian attack on Kyiv. This intensified the demand of the Zelnski team for an increasingly advanced weapon from the USA and Europe.
2560	7	However, these demands may be too small and late. Deliveries are susceptible to a Russian attack, and weapons require training, some of which are complicated and long. What's more, while Russia initially suffered heavy losses, the current artillery offensive costs Ukraine some of the best trained soldiers. Kiev's ability to further repel Moscow's attacks is uncertain.
2560	9	Until now, in Washington and individual European capitals, focused on accelerating the supply of weapons has been concentrated. But Polish politician Radosław Sikorski, a former Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, who is currently sitting in the European Parliament, proposed a radical alternative: Ukrainian armament with nuclear weapons. Sikorski said: "Because Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum, I believe that we, as the West, would have the right to provide Ukraine with nuclear heads."
2560	11	His justification is wrong. The Budapest Memorandum from 1994, which regulated Kiev's resignation from the nuclear weapon left after the collapse of the Soviet Union, contained the parties' obligation to "strive for immediately taking action by the UN Security Council in order to help Ukraine", if the latter was attacked or threatened with a weapon attack nuclear. It was a senseless promise, because the only alleged potential aggressor, Russia, had a veto that the UN could immobilize. However, Kyiv signed it with the awareness that the contract does not give any significant guarantee of security.
2560	13	Undoubtedly, Kyiv could now regret that he did not give the inherited nuclear arsenal, although he lacked operational control over weapons. Considering American, and especially European commitment to nuclear weapons, Ukraine would be difficult to keep a nuclear weapon during the pursuit of integration with the West. India paid a significant economic price for the development of their arsenal before the administration of George W. Bush accepted reality and New Delhi as a nuclear power.
2560	15	In any case, the chance of Ukraine passed a long time ago. And no one suggested the transfer of nuclear weapons to Kiev in the period preceding Russia's attack, which would probably exacerbate the crisis and accelerate Moscow's invasion. Doing this today, when the war is crazy, would threaten to transform a terrible conflict into a real disaster.
2560	17	During the Cold War, nuclear weapons probably helped prevent conventional conflict on a full scale between the USA and the USSR. However, if a war broke out between them, having nuclear weapons would significantly increase danger. The losing page would have the temptation to use nuclear weapons to restore balance. Indeed, Washington, which had a smaller army, threatened to answer the invasion of Western Europe with nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War, which had a smaller army. Now the situation between America and Russia has reversed.
2560	19	India and Pakistan were not nuclear powers when they fought three wars on a full scale. Their ability to destroy each other could prevent the fourth conflict, although they organized a limited but long -lasting war in Kashmir in 1999, known as Kargil's war, after both countries tested nuclear weapons. Pakistani provocations, such as terrorist attacks on the parliament of India in 2001 and Bombaj in 2008, threatened with war that could be stopped with fear of using nuclear weapons.
2560	21	Of course, Ukraine needs something more than nuclear weapons to become a nuclear power. He would also need transfer means - aircraft or missiles, along with a related training. And, of course, such a plan could not be easily kept secret. Moscow can answer preventively with nuclear weapons to prevent Ukraine from the distribution of operational forces. After the statement of Sikorski, the head of Russian Duma Wiaczesław Wołodin warned: "Sikorski provokes a nuclear conflict in the center of Europe. He doesn't think about the future of Ukraine or Poland. If his proposals are implemented, these countries will disappear, just like Europe. "
2560	23	In any case, the idea is unsuccessful. Among the allies, only the US, France and Great Britain have nuclear weapons. The French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to find a diplomatic exit from the war. British Boris Johnson would hesitate whether to deepen his European status of Parias, transferring nuclear weapons to Ukraine. President Joe Biden has just returned from a trip to South Korea, where he confirmed Washington's determination to denuclearize North Korea. Even the Polish government, competing with the Baltic countries in calling for the involvement of NATO in Ukraine, did not support Sikorski's proposal.
2560	25	Nevertheless, the fact that once a serious politician would be in favor of transforming the ongoing conflict into nuclear confrontation, shows how dangerous this conflict became. Moscow's invasion was unjustified. However, the allied attempt to make Ukraine a winner - more and more often supported by supporters of Ukraine in the American political elite - threatens the escalation of war from Russia.
2560	27	President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose and has resources to avoid it, including the ability to start full military mobilization and the use of weapons of mass destruction - chemical, nuclear or both. Moscow has a higher stake and therefore will always be willing to pay and risk more. The USA has nothing at a scarf, which would justify the risk of Kiev's nuclear destruction. However, some decision -makers are ready to take advantage of this opportunity. Indeed, both Senator Mitt Romney and Evelyn Farkas from the McCain Institute would do it, even if Russia used nuclear weapons against someone else, which would be an extremely irresponsible position that would threaten the future of America.
2560	29	Common support for Ukraine is understandable. However, this should not be done at the expense of US security. The highest priority of Biden administration is the safety of America, its inhabitants, territory, freedom and prosperity. This puts the order of the Russian-Ukrainian war quickly. The longer it lasts, the greater the damage to Ukraine, the threat to Europe and the danger to America. And even more so people can be tempted to try extreme ideas, such as Sikorski. The nuclear power in war would be a terrible sight.
2561	1	When lies come home
2561	3	During the Russian-Ukrainian war, all articles on Russia and Ukraine may contain propaganda content favorable to one of the parties to the conflict. The following article favorable to Russia comes from the American medium.
2561	5	After months of lies, the media prepare recipients for the military defeat of Ukraine.
2561	7	Diogenes, one of the most important philosophers of the ancient world, believed that lies were the currency of politics and these lies were those he was looking for to reveal and depreciate them. To emphasize his point of view, he sometimes walked with a lighthouse on the streets of Athens in broad daylight. If he asked him why he did it, he would answer that he was looking for an honest man.
2561	9	Finding an honest man in Washington today is an equally great challenge. Diogenes would need xenon headlights in both hands.
2561	11	However, there are still short moments of light in the Washington establishment. For months, he abundantly lies about the American audience as to the causes and course of the war in Ukraine, the media are currently preparing American, British and other Western recipients for the military defeat of Ukraine. But this is a late surgery.
2561	13	The Western media did everything that was in their power to give the impression that the defense of Ukraine has much greater strength than it really has. Attentive observers noticed that the same films showing an attack on Russian tanks are shown many times. Local counterattacks were presented as if they were maneuvers of operational importance.
2561	15	Russian mistakes were exaggerated disproportionately to their real meaning. Russian losses and actual sizes of Ukraine's losses were distorted, factory -faced or simply ignored. But the conditions of the battlefield have changed a bit during this time. When the Ukrainian forces stopped in static defensive positions in urban and Central Donbas, the position of Ukrainians became hopeless. But this development of the situation was presented as a defeat of the Russians who did not achieve "their assumed goals".
2561	17	Land forces that immobilize their soldiers on prepared defensive lines will be recognized, taken and destroyed from a distance. When permanent overhead intelligence, observation and reconnaissance, manned or unmanned devices, they are combined with precise directed weapons or modern artillery systems operating on the basis of accurate data on goals, "maintaining position" is fatal to every ground force. This is all the more true in Ukraine, where from the very beginning of Russian activities it was clear that they care about destroying Ukrainian forces, and not to occupy cities or the territories of Ukraine west of the Dnieper.
2561	19	The result was - piece by piece - the Annihilation of Ukrainian forces. Only the episodic tributary of weapons from the USA and allies allowed to maintain a field of abused Kiev legions. Legions that are now dying of great losses because they are leading a war instead of Washington.
2561	21	The war with Moscow is a defeat for Kiev. Ukrainian forces are devoid of everything. Trained reserves do not exist in such a quantity to affect the battle situation, and it worsens with every hour. No military assistance or advisers can change this brutal reality, with one exception - direct intervention of US and NATO land forces.
2561	23	Today, the problem is not to give the territory and population of Eastern Ukraine Moscow, which Moscow is already controlling. The future of the regions of Khersonia, Zaporozhye, together with Donbass, is already a foregone conclusion. Moscow will probably also protect Kharkiv and Odessa, two historically Russian and Russian -speaking cities, as well as adjacent territories. These operations will cause the conflict to be prolonged for the summer. That is why the problem for today is how to stop the fights.
2561	25	Whether the fighting ends in early autumn depends on the two main factors. The first lies with the authorities in Kiev. Will the Zelanski government agree to the Biden concept of permanent conflict with Russia?
2561	27	If Biden's administration puts on its own, Kyiv will continue to function as a base for creating new forces capable of threatening Moscow. In practice, this means for Kiev national suicide by opening the heart of Ukraine west of the Dnieper to the devastating attacks of long -range missiles and rocket forces.
2561	29	Of course, this development of accidents is not inevitable. Berlin, Paris, Rome, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Vilnius, Riga, Tallin and yes, even Warsaw, do not have to blindly follow Washington. Europeans, like most Americans, look into the abyss of all areas of economic breakdown, to which Biden has already led in their own country. However, other than the Americans who have to deal with the consequences of Biden's miscarriage, European governments still have the option to reject the Biden Plan of Permanent War in Ukraine.
2561	31	The second factor concerns Washington himself. After pumping $ 60 billion, or a little more than 18 billion a month in the Ukrainian state, which trembles in positions, through direct or indirect transfers, the basic question is, what is happening to Ukrainians from the rest of the country who have not escaped? Where will the funds to rebuild the torn society of Ukraine in the developing global crisis economic situation?
2561	33	When inflation meant that the costs of an average American house increased by $ 460 per month for the purchase of the same goods and services compared to last year, it is quite likely that Ukraine can easily sink in the depths of waves, like Titanic, without causing much interest in the American electorate . Experienced politicians know that the time interval in which Americans focus attention on non-American matters is very short that admitting to defeat in Ukraine would probably have small or any direct consequences.
2561	35	However, the effects of repeated strategic failures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria accumulate. In the 1980s, General Motors wanted to dictate to the Americans what cars were to buy, but American consumers had a different opinion. That is why GM, which dominated the American market for 77 years, lost its position in favor of Toyota. Washington cannot impose all effects, nor can he escape from responsibility for his spreading expenses and ruining American prosperity.
2561	37	In November, the Americans will go to the urns. The electorate itself will do more than just test the American election system. Elections will also probably make Biden be remembered for his lack of compromise, for refusing to change the course, just like Herbert Hoover in 1932. Democrats will remember that their predecessors in the Democratic Party have successfully fought Hoover for over half a century. Rebuables can fight with Joe Biden for the next 50 years.
2561	38	A word of explanation from the translator
2561	40	The word of explanation - the last two sentences are understandable for people interested in the United States internal policy. Herbert Hoover, a republican, won the election in 1928, and then lost to F.D. Roosevelt in 1932. He was remembered as the president of the great crisis, who did not cope with him and despite many positive sides of his presidency, his term of office in widespread perception is considered a failure. In turn, "50 years" may mean the advantage of Democrats in the USA to Ronald Reagan's times despite the fact that the presidents of Republicans happened at that time, but just like Eisenhower were basically only GOP candidates, or they compromised like Nixon. The author suggests that Biden's term will be similarly remembered as a failure, and the Republicans will be easier to win over the next 50 years.
2564	1	Grzegorz Braun and scientists on peace in Ukraine
2564	3	AKO National-Radical Environment We have our position on the war in Ukraine (read HERE), but we also present different views, because this is the mission of the portal nationalista.pl since 2005. Below is a declaration of reading in the Sejm by MP Grzegorz Braun.
2564	5	    The people and organizations gathered here are calling to immediately end the war in Ukraine and to compromise between Russia and Ukraine, which will lead to lasting peace. War is the greatest human and cultural tragedy. Every day people die on both sides: they take their dreams and the personal potential they represent forever. This is a great human tragedy. The war is associated with degeneration. During its duration, acts of cruelty and war crimes occur. War teaches us hostility and hatred. He degenerates us as people. In the name of defending the life and our humanity, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine should be stopped immediately.
2564	7	    The current war in which NATO countries are involved, providing Ukraine with a modern weapon, including offensive, is the most dangerous armed conflict since World War II. It is a great threat to the economic situation of the world and for the world peace. The population of many countries is currently threatened by hunger due to the decrease in grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, there is a rapid increase in fuel prices in the world, which is produced by Russia. As a consequence, we are threatened with a global economic crisis, with almost unimaginable effects. An even greater tragedy will be the situation when the current war gets out of control and turns into a continental war or another world war from a local conflict. This will mean hundreds of millions of victims, the destruction of states and the fall of all our civilization achievements.
2564	9	    We believe that for peace and resolution of the conflict you need to understand its causes well. The basic factor that often stands for the reasons for wars is fear. In this case, it is Russia's fear of the extension of NATO and the fear of neighboring countries before the power of Russia. To resolve the conflict, therefore, mutual fear should be removed, and only professional diplomacy and readiness to compromise, not - warfare can lead to this. Another reasons for the current war, as is being talked about, is the introduction of changes in the language law in Ukraine, discriminating against the Russian language minority. This led to a referendum in the Crimea and the war in Donbas. The current war is also a consequence of improper internal policy. It leads to a great human tragedy and huge damage. Matters are not solved by war and pulling the whole world into it, but with conversation and compromise. So we call for conversations, compromise and room.
2564	11	    In the globalized world in which we live, countries are interdependent. Due to the world position of Russia and Ukraine, the consequences of the current war have a catastrophic influence on the whole world. It is not too late to solve this conflict, which is very harmful and dangerous to all of us. We call for reason, to hesitate and to the room.
2564	13	    "Nothing is lost by peace. Everything can be lost by the war "(Pius XII, 1939).

In turn, nationalists from the NOP were picketing at the part of Solidarity in front of the detention center, to which Grzegorz Braun went for "an insult to the court."
2569	1	Donald Tusk: PiS will end, it will end
2569	3	If someone was able to fight with expensive, take inflation and strangle it to zero, it was my government - said the chairman of the Civic Platform Donald Tusk on Saturday during the convention of this party.
2569	5	The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and cold and hot water in a tap - said Donald Tusk's leader at the convention. Meanwhile, as PiS will continue to rule, at the end of the year bread can cost up to PLN 30 - he added.
2569	7	The "Convention of the Future" of Platforma Obywatelska took place in the sports and entertainment hall of the Radom Sports Center. According to the organizers, there were almost 6,000 people. The podium from which the PO politicians spoke was set up in the middle of the room, like a boxing ring. It was also a reference to the first PO convention in 2001, when the leaders of PO Donald Tusk, Andrzej Olechowski and Maciej Płażyński stood on a similar "platform".
2569	9	Donald Tusk, chairman of the Platform, spoke first, who spoke over 40 minutes. "It is not a coincidence that it is in this place, you, and nobody else, show Poland, where there is strength, where there is good will, where there is hope for a change," said Tusk to the gathered.
2569	11	In his speech he referred to the annual, re -management of the platform. He emphasized that he has visited nearly 100 cities in recent months. "I met people on this path who, like you, like almost all of Poland today, are very taken over Hope and faith that this situation can be changed, "he said.
2569	13	Tusk added that he invited the hosts of some of his meetings to the convention. "These are not people involved in political activities. They were those who wanted to talk to me, although, as you may know, it is not always easy" - he noted. "We live today in a country where you need to have personal courage to talk publicly with the opposition leader," he said.
2569	15	He said that thanks to conversations with farmers he understood why "the Polish village turns away from the rulers today, why Polish farmers feel cheated today by the rulers." "Because they were cheated," he said. "What does it mean to calculate and plan profitable production in a situation where artificial fertilizers increased within a year by 700-800 percent, not to mention the fuel" - he added.
2569	17	The PO leader also spoke about police officers. He stated that "Polish policewomen and Polish policemen are going to service - almost everyone without exception - in order to defend Poles and chase bandits, not to defend power against citizens."
2569	19	He described his meeting on Wiejska Street with policemen who, before they turned to him, looked around them thoroughly. "They say to me: Prime Minister, maybe you would finally order it, because we wanted to be in the police to chase bandits, not to stand for hours, days and weeks under the Sejm or in Nowogrodzka," said Tusk. He assessed that "policemen are also largely victims of this system that PiS built in Poland - they really want to help us, not disturb us."
2569	21	Tusk also drew attention to the situation of teachers. "We have more and older and older teachers at the Polish school today - for obvious reasons. After all, this profession, which should be one of the most attractive - because we all respect and love their teachers and their teachers - he has probably become the most humiliating profession. Teachers and teachers The authorities in the same week when she gave herself - ministers, president, prime minister - increases from 40 to 60 percent - at the same time she told Polish teachers that they could get a 4 % increase in inflation 16 %. " he said. "We will never forget this humiliation, spit in the face," said the leader of the PO.
2569	23	After giving examples of entrepreneurs running small companies - Bistro and Baker's owners - he said that "it is clearly seen that the situation in the entire Polish economy is beginning to be critical."
2569	25	He cited forecasts according to which a third of gastronomic premises in Poland may not survive until the end of the year. He referred to the IBRIS study, showing that nearly 35 percent, families gave up the planned vacation; One -third of families had to reduce food expenditure, a similar percentage resigned from purchasing household appliances and RTV devices. According to Tusk, "it is clear that the situation in the entire Polish economy is beginning to be critical."
2569	27	"The essence of a good government is the ability to provide people with good and cheap bread and cold and hot water in a tap," said Tusk. Meanwhile, if PiS continues to rule, then - here he referred to experts - the loaf of bread will cost PLN 10 or even PLN 30 at the end of the year.
2569	29	"What happened that for seven years from Poland, a really flourishing country, pride of Europe, made a country where water and bread become a problem?" - He was asking.
2569	31	"What is the real sources of this Pisz proach, this inflation that is already record -breaking in Europe in Europe? Why is it must be the most expensive with us? The reason for this Pisz past is greed and stupidity," said Tusk.
2569	33	He argued that one of the largest pro-wire impulses is the "Legion of PiS activists who got worse in state-owned companies and you will get without hesitation." "PiS will end, it will end," he said.
2569	35	He accused the President of NBP Adam Glapiński's lack of competence and the inability to predict, recalling his statements from less than two years ago, about deflation as a threat and "alleged threat of inflation".
2569	37	He reminded that in November last year The head of the central bank announced a decrease in inflation, and he said it "almost the same day, when Prime Minister Morawiecki spent millions of zlotys on bonds that were to protect his private savings against inflation."
2569	39	"He assumed that inflation would be gigantic, but he did not tell Poles. Quietly, secretly from citizens, the rulers secured a lot of money" - said the chairman of the Civic Platform. "Thieves!" - chanted the gathered.
2569	41	The leader of Platforma Obywatelska also announced that if he won the election, "leaving Glapiński from the NBP". "Adam Glapiński is not only incompetent, not only indecent in what he does. Adam Glapiński is also illegal. He will not be the president of the NBP for a long time.
2569	43	He reminded that the legal obstacles related to Glapiński's re -election for the second term at the National Bank of Poland were indicated by experts of the Chancellery of the President. "A much less doubt would be enough to lead a guest from the NBP. And I will do it, I guarantee it to you" - assured Tusk. Pursuant to the Act on the National Bank of Poland, more than two terms may be sought on the NBP Board. Before choosing Adam Glapiński for the second term of the head of the NBP, it was argued that he had already completed his two terms in the bank's authorities, because in 2016 he had already sat at the NBP for several months.
2569	45	During the speech, he thanked everyone who got involved, among others In the Democracy Defense Committee, they went out into the streets. "Thanks to you, faith survived that it is worth establishing your own committees and chasing arrogant power by organizing and organizing all people of good will" - he pointed out.
2569	47	He recalled the slogan of Jacek Kuroń: Do not comb the committees, assume your own, referring to the burning of the building of the Provincial Committee of the PZPR in Radom in June 1976.
2569	49	He also noted that it is in Radom that he could say that, as he compares the image of Radom from 1976 and today's Poland, "this picture is so similar that it can lead to despair."
2569	51	He argued that PiS president Jarosław Kaczyński is "a representative of power who mocks, humiliates, despises people, including children who need special tenderness." He pointed to "Kaczyński's Rechot, it was the mockery of Kaczyński and people of power over the disabled." "You remember this press conference on the street because the disabled were not allowed to the Sejm? PiS told them: Won! Sejm is for us and you can organize yourself on the street" - he said to the participants of the convention.
2569	53	"We are also here so that the authorities never despise again, it does not despise weaker people," he said.
2569	55	At the same time, he said: "There will come a moment that we will all organize on the street if this power does not disappear."
2569	57	Referring to the weakest rights, "those who need help, or at least understanding and respect" said: "There is zero tolerance and no mercy for those who are looking for some rotten compromises here." He announced that the PO program would be, among others "Breaking with hypocrisy, with this hypocrisy, e.g. with the commission that examines pedophilia."
2569	59	"As soon as we take over power, as soon as we win the election (...) it will not be that it is a politician, Speaker of the Sejm, bishop, minister, a high official ... It will not be that in matters of harm children, pedophilia, violence against children, that There will be some holy inviolable cows, "he said.
2569	61	"They will no longer be saints, untouchable cows. Only children in Poland are holy and untouchable," he noted.
2569	63	The leader of the Civic Platform also reminded that he is a father and grandfather. "And I am turning to fathers and grandparents: if you have, like me, a daughter, a granddaughter, you cannot vote for PiS for God's love" - ​​emphasized Tusk. "They really prepared hell to women and they will make hell to your daughters and your grandchildren," he added.
2569	65	He argued that he is the addressee of many requests or alarm about what is happening in Polish homes because the current ruling team has no idea about life. "I am sorry that I will be brutal, but are the gentlemen: Kaczyński, Rydzyk, Jędraszewski, what they know, for God's love, about motherhood, fatherhood, family, sex, bed? - asked Tusk, to which the hall reacted enthusiastically, thunderous applause to.
2569	67	He appealed to his fathers and grandparents to "talk" with their daughters and grandchildren. "Really, they will tell you everything, coffee for a bench" - he encouraged. "And I also say it as a Christian. People, if someone believes in God, feels a Christian, he can vote for a party that has a meer, Kurski ... What are we talking about?" - the head of the Platform was surprised.
2569	69	"Listen, can you vote for a lie, thief, contempt, hatred?" - He was asking. "You believe in God, you don't vote for PiS, it's easy as a wire" - he added.
2571	1	Grzegorz Braun about life and family - answers to queries to presidential candidates
2571	3	Grzegorz Braun, the presidential candidate asked by the Foundation, was the first to answer the questions. Below we publish the List sent to the editorial office of our portal.
2571	5	Ladies and Gentlemen,
2571	7	Thank you for the letter - the answers to the questions asked in it will come to me, it will be easier for me that in fact I have given them a long time ago and more than once. I had the opportunity to speak publicly on topics a few times, which, like the state, I consider the key to the fate of the nation and the Polish state, or more broadly, the entire Latin civilization. As the author of documentary films commonly perceived as a clear voice for life, and against inhuman eugenic theories and criminal abortion practices - by the way, often in contact with harassing criticism from anti -Polish centers and anti -Catholic propaganda - I gave, I gave, I think, I think, I gave it. Therefore, I refer everyone interested in my views to the films: "Eugenics - in the name of progress" and "Not for Mary Wagner", in which I managed to, I hope, include sufficiently wide arguments and exemplification referring to almost all you set for you issues. However, I understand that the application of my candidacy in the upcoming presidential election creates a new situation, in which it is understandable to expect that opinions previously scattered in various publications (except for film, including press, radio, etc.), will now be collected and clearly repeated - as well I do (maintaining the numbering of questions issued by you).
2571	9	1. So do I think that Polish law should protect every person from conception? Yes Sir. I definitely think so. At the same time, I understand that talking about "protecting man" you have legal protection of every human life - regardless of age, health, state of property, etc. Yes, the law cannot make this principle any exceptions that would result from the arbitrary assessment of "quality" or the level of expectations of others towards human life. (I make an exception, of course, for adults who, with their deliberate action, appear beyond the law, and this is: deliberate killers, state traitors, spies and deserters in the face of the enemy - giving these criminals a legal guarantee of life is in turn terrible and absurd Uphest - for the use of such cases I strongly postulate the restitution of the main penalty).
2571	11	In particular, do I think that children suspected of illness or genetic defect can be deprived of life through abortion? No, under no circumstances. In the film "Not about Mary Wagner" I presented, I think, sufficiently wide arguments and exemplification explaining such a position. The very concept of evaluation or "imperfections" of our fellow men and the judgment on this basis, who "deserves" to live, is in the very essence a horrendous urge - and in the practical consequences, as we know, it leads to the slaughter of innocent. So I reject all legal solutions that make such practices unpunished. So I reject, obviously, in force in the Third Polish Republic, the so -called "Abortion compromise". I would like to remind you that this is a legal status on the level of solutions in force in the Third Reich, where the law also did not allow every child's unpunished murder - "only" some children (sic).
2571	13	2. Do I think that anyone has the right to have another person? No. I strongly reject such a breach.
2571	15	In particular, do I think that anyone has the right to have a child and, consequently, to produce him using the in vitro method? No, nothing similar. In the film "Eugenics - in the name of progress" I tried to realize that the inevitably occurring in the "in vitro" procedure, the moment of selection makes the whole criminal procedure, and advertising it - especially perfidious and wicked. By the way, it is worth noting that the legal acceptance of "in vitro" practice receives the logical foundations of opposition to abortion - since we agree to select in this phase of life, on what basis would we question the right to conduct the same selection in other phases? And maybe this is what - maybe apart from the obvious interests of the "in vitro" industry, his promoters are also about: introducing legal consent to abortion somehow with a "kitchen door"?
2571	17	3. Do you think that marriage and family should be particularly protected? Yes, in did. I believe that the attitude to life, marriage and family is at all one of the main criteria for values, legitimacy and efficiency of each legal system, every country, every civilization. By the way, that's why I question the legitimacy of the current Warsaw government (which I don't call Polish to avoid possible misunderstandings). This government, he, even, even initiates subsequent acts hostile to the Polish family - acting against the natural law, agreeing into parental responsibility, creating guaranteed demand for industry services "in vitro", implementing the ideology of "gender" to the Polish legal system, initiating disinformation and depravity of minors with the help of state educational coercion, etc. etc. The Warsaw state (which I do not call Polish) implements the strategy of perfidious aggression aimed at the family - also when it promotes legal acts such as the "anti -violence convention", whose authors are of a traditional family want to make the main suspect and culpring of all pathologies (doing this by the way not only Contrary to nature, but also against all real, statistically recognizable realities of social life in Poland).
2571	19	Do you allow you to marry a relationship other than a relationship of a man and a woman? No, I don't allow. As a normal Pole, I reject all arbitrary, absurd, ideologically motivated, and politically enforced manipulations of the meaning of any words. And as a certified Polish teacher, I remind you of a long tradition of language manipulation to achieve propaganda goals by the regime fighting with our civilization - modifying, and sometimes reversing the meanings of words is the essence of every total "news".
2571	21	4. Do you think that the state can forcibly educate children against the values ​​of parents? In particular, can a state school encourage promiscuity, support perverse sexual relations, promote inclusion and encourage abortion? Apparently maybe - since it does so commonly. I, and this is the state of affairs to condemn and I am very happy to criticize. Some of you may be known to my critical attitude towards state, dominated, centralized, forced education. For years I have been trying not to neglect the opportunity to criticize the Kołłątajsko-Stalin teaching system. In this context, my radically unlucky attitude towards any theories and pedagogical practices questioning parental authority is obvious. By the way: the fact described in historiography is the special emphasis on the principle of state education Masonic lodges - researchers are known even by the progress and the French French Masonry Directive of the XIX/XX above. - Precisely because without state coercion the remaining principles of those who were fighting with Catholic tradition and Polish organization could not be so effectively broadcast and implemented.
2571	23	Each of the above issues, of course, deserves a more serious discussion and demands wider argument - which I will abandon here, understanding that you do not lack arguments, but you want to know my position clear in these matters. I hope that I do not leave a field here for fundamental doubts. However, if they came up - I serve with further explanations. First of all, please, however, kindly note that, apart from my own insight, I would like to rely on the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church in this matter (as in any other) - and this is a context in which all my comments should be interpreted.
2571	25	Finally, please accept my sincere thanks for your commitment, for your boldly occurring in Polish public life - with wishes, that matters you are going to find will finally find successful conclusions. What we will not be able to lead to if the law in the Republic of Poland is still constituted by people who despise human life and God are not afraid - with passive participation, after all, more numerous "supporters of the compromise". This is a disgrace card, which in the face of the upcoming 1050th anniversary of the baptism of Poland is finally to reverse.
2577	1	Nowacka: We agree, abortion admissible to the 12th week
2577	3	I can't imagine my friends from the party to let go of the thing in which they put so much effort. Donald Tusk was skeptical, but he saw the scale of women's protests and adopted a position prepared by the platform MPs - believes Barbara Nowacka.
2577	5	Are you winning the election and what is happening with abortion?
2577	7	The law must be liberalized. There are ready bills.
2577	9	Is the civic coalition line consistent? Does not seem.
2577	11	Is. But the change in law is not enough: you need to introduce sex education, available contraception and a social campaign showing the truth.
2577	13	Truth?
2577	15	Yes. Some PiS voters are against changes because they have been propaganda for years. We need to show what abortion is a ban on and what liberalization means.
2577	17	And what is the truth about liberalization?
2577	19	Such that every Polish woman will be able to stop pregnancy to the 12th week.
2577	21	And this is to calm PiS voters?
2577	23	It is worth making them realize that these choices are still happening, only in the gray zone. You have to show what dramas bad law leads to. If we do not show this, the idea of ​​power may again appear to screw the screw.
2577	25	You talk about ready -made projects. What?
2577	27	There is even a project to save women.
2577	29	Was. As civic who was lost in the Sejm.
2577	31	Yes, I put it myself as a civic initiative. It was lost but physically exists. It is complete - it contains issues of sex education and availability of contraception, it has solutions regulating the conscience clause. So what KO proposes as part of a pact for women.
2577	33	Do you want to prohibit the clause?
2577	35	No, this is the right of doctors. But you need to take into account the right of patients: they must know who they are going to. Today they don't know and this is a lottery. Which translates not only into the issue of abortion, but also access to contraception.
2577	37	In the light of the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal regarding the anti -abortion law, this project is unconstitutional?
2577	39	Neither the tribunal is a sentence. The body that issued him cannot create the right and interpret it. It is burdened with primary sin, and this means that it can be considered not.
2577	41	So the first step she would like to take KO would be changes in the Constitutional Tribunal?
2577	43	Certainly there would have to be a large reform. Transitional regulations would be needed so as not to shake the system. But yes, this is the concept, specialists are working on it. And then in fact from the machine we would return to the reality in which previous regulations apply, including those regarding abortion.
2577	45	For now, you have not won the elections, so it is difficult to talk about the chances of your project. But you are in the Sejm, and instead of becoming a liberalization, the issue of abortion has been tightened. What now?
2577	47	What you can do without violating the pseudo -bodies of the Constitutional Tribunal is to remove a record about the punishment of doctors. The most important thing is that they direct to prenatal tests. That they would not be afraid of abortion because of the mental well -being of a woman. That they would not be afraid to make decisions to save women.
2577	49	What if the Supreme Court deals with the issue of mental well -being in the context of abortion, and considers that this is not a prerequisite in accordance with the Act?
2577	51	We have no chance to counteract this with the current power. The obliging judge Ziobra will issue a sentence, and everything will accept the Sejm majority.
2577	53	Is abortion politically to win?
2577	55	This is not a political topic, but social.
2577	57	But he became political. Politicians must decide what pays for them in this matter.
2577	59	It pays to lead to a situation where women are safe. And this can be guaranteed, giving them the right to decide how much, with whom and when they will have children.
2577	61	It's profitable? So what?
2577	63	I can't talk about fundamental matters for women's life and health in terms of support posts.
2577	65	But you are a politician.
2577	67	If I was a PiS politician, I would not wonder if it pays to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people. It is not a matter of political calculations, but a necessity. Saying that the party must look at the polls as an explanation ...
2577	69	But I think he does that. Marshal Kidawa-Błońska said this month that abortion is evil. And Tusk argued that the compromise would be a problem for the platform.
2577	71	The election will not be won on the subject of abortion. But they can be lost when Polish women die because they did not have access to the procedure.
2577	73	Or when he gets the other way and says that they can have an abortion on request?
2577	75	There is no such thing as "abortion on request", only a woman's decision: easier, difficult or very difficult.
2577	77	Maybe politicians are afraid that society is conservative and will lose talking about abortion openly?
2577	79	It is no longer so conservative. Women are changing, and the climate in small towns is changing. It was visible from the protests.
2577	81	And yet KO must constantly talk about her political line in this matter.
2577	83	No! All 4 parties agree that abortion should be permissible to the 12th week. PO and Modern are for an additional condition, i.e. a consultation with a psychologist. We will talk about the details.
2577	85	You can talk for a long time. How can you be sure that KO will change the law?
2577	87	I see that many of our deputies, after the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal, changed their attitude. There is also a social change, a gigantic shift towards Pro Choice - more and more people are in favor of liberalization of the law. The politicians, also conservative ones, influence their wife and daughters, who are more aware that it is their lives. The parties have also undergone changes.
2577	89	So if KO won, it will be a change?
2577	91	I can't imagine my friends from the party to let go of the thing in which they put so much effort. Donald Tusk was skeptical at the beginning. But he saw the scale of women's protests and adopted a position prepared by the platform MPs. We can certainly cooperate with the left in this matter. However, there is a great question mark when it comes to PSL and Poland 2050 Szymon Hołownia. They will be the hard partners.
2577	93	In this term of the Sejm, nothing will change?
2577	95	In the subject of abortion? No. MPs of the United Right are on a short leash Kaczyński. In this context, vote on the civic project "Stop abortion" promises to be extremely interesting, which says, among others at 25 years in prison for abortion. Also for women. Ryszard Terlecki at the conference said that they would reject the project at first reading. But he added that there would be no discipline. So we will see how many PiS politicians can express their own opinion.
2577	97	So, to put it precisely: the ruling majority may vote for the application to reject the project at first reading, which will submit ...
2577	99	Citizens' Coalition, probably also the left.
2577	101	The civic project tightening the law went to the Sejm, and on the other side there is a civic project "Legal abortion without compromises" still without the required 100,000. signatures.
2577	103	Please ask the committee that collects them.
2577	105	But you were involved in the twin project, "Save women".
2577	107	I chaired this committee twice and there was no problem with collecting signatures twice. Although, I must admit that this is hard work. The one they ask for about the leftist and women's politicians, and the Polish initiative (whose Nowacka - ed.) Was not invited. The women's strike set the left. But we support, for example, in my parliamentary office, you can sign it.
2577	109	Is this your diplomatic answer to the question about the lack of unity of opposition or leftist circles in the subject of abortion?
2577	111	When I collected signatures for "Save women", there was no political unity. I invited everyone to this initiative, because I think the matter is what matters, not a party sign. I can't say why such a strategy was adopted today around "legal abortion". Why were the signatures not collected during the last demonstrations? Why wasn't we talking to us about this? The fact, when we collected signatures in 2016 and 2017, there was no pandemic, the social atmosphere was heated. It allowed to have faith that it would succeed. Also slow down the changes. Because we should remember that we also fought against attempts to increase penalties for abortion. And then it succeeded.
2577	113	And today? After the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal and after the events in the Poviat Hospital in Pszczyna, the atmosphere is not hot?
2577	115	Today we have an atmosphere of despair. We go out not with the offensive slogans of the liberalization of the law, but with a dramatic appeal: "#neutral". The truth is also that submitting projects in today's Sejm does not make sense, because PiS has for the argument the said sentence of the pseudo -otribunal. And he will say this: we reject the project because it is unconstitutional.
2577	117	While collecting signatures for "Save Women" was another parliamentary arithmetic?
2577	119	No, she was equally difficult. But then, in addition to collecting signatures, we made a gigantic social campaign showing the truth, i.e. what abortion law looks like, which means access to safe, legal abortion, how important sex education and effective contraception are. And also in what situation there are women who go to the doctor, and in the office they hear that there is a conscience clause here.
2577	121	You are in favor of removing art. 152 from the Penal Code, which talks about punishment for making or help in abortion?
2577	123	Yes, to this, among others It comes down to the so -called Rescue Act. He talks about the abortion depenalization.
2577	125	Today, this article is accused of activists of women's organizations.
2577	127	These activists help in crisis situations when the state systemally turns away from women. In a moment everything will be read as aid. If a girl on the street approaches me and I will give her an abortion number without borders, will I have to expect allegations? Help in making a decision about abortion, in informing about possible roads should not be punishable.
2577	129	And doctors? How do you assess their attitude today? On the one hand, they say that they are afraid of prosecutor's allegations. On the other - we hear allegations of washing hands.
2577	131	They cannot be blamed for the fact that you are ruled by fanatics. Their fear is not unfounded. Therefore, our idea for the current situation is to provide doctors with a sense of security.
2577	133	How?
2577	135	We start a series of meetings with local government officials. We want to use their good practices, e.g. Warsaw and the decision of the city president immediately after the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal - so that hospitals would work, so that they do not cover with a conscience clause. You also need to organize legal assistance to doctors. In the field of interpretation of current regulations, as well as in ad hoc situations - it is also a task for local governments.
2578	1	Is abortion or is it not? It's not the point
2578	3	It does not matter whether we consider the right to abortion as fundamental law or not. It is important that the prohibition or limitation of this right may be a violation of a woman's rights.
2578	5	I worked for some time in the office of the European Court of Human Rights. I conducted three, assigned to me by way of a draw, Polish matters regarding the relationship between the 1993 Act on family planning, protection of the human fetus and the conditions of admissibility of interrupting pregnancy and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms - which convention is part of the Polish legal order from 1993.
2578	7	These were three cases: Alicja Tysiąc complaint, R.R. and the complaint of P. and S. all ended in judgments in which the Court ruled that in relation to the applicants women, the Polish authorities violated the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom. The right to respect private life was violated, and in the case of P. i. S. - also a ban on inhuman treatment. For the purposes of these matters, I ate professional teeth in studying consequences that the prohibition or limitation of access to legal abortion have for human rights - in the dimension of national law, in a legal perspective and international law.
2578	9	That is why I read some legal enunciations about abortion with some irritation - due to carefree authors, the superficiality of their texts or the hard ideologization of the subject, resistant to the rules of legal craftsmanship, and often also to facts. Example from recent days: an interview with my talented colleague, patron Tomasz Snarski, published by the Catholic Information Agency. I understand that Kai, like a rain kite, needs an expert ID for the content she published about the legal aspects of termination of pregnancy. However, I have a serious problem with what Snarski says as an expert.
2578	11	Human rights for a woman
2578	13	By using a trick of a grand statement as the fact that "abortion is not human law", he manages to ignore - or to distract the reader's attention - that the legal admissibility of abortion shapes and affects human rights whose subject is a woman.
2578	15	We read in an interview that "when it comes to ensuring state protection for women who may be in the event of the need to stop pregnancy, there is no need to refer to human rights." We will not find in the words of Snarski information about the relationship between the way the law determines the admissibility of interrupting pregnancy and human rights due to the woman. As if this relationship did not exist, and the right to interrupt pregnancy was, as Snarski says, a gracious "exception" or "concession" of the legislator. ) in individual provinces, which determined the conditions for the admissibility of abortion).
2578	17	The thing is not whether the legal interruption of pregnancy is human or it is not. The thing is that to assess the way the law regulates the issue of access to legal abortion (as well as to other medical services in the field of reproductive health), the fundamental right to respect the private life of a woman applies. This law guarantees every person art. 47 of the Constitution, Article 8 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in Poland or Art. 7 European Cart of Fundamental Rights - that I will mention only the most important acts of national or international law. It should also not be forgotten that respect for private life and protection against interference from the state have been part of the European and Anglo -Saxon legal tradition for centuries.
2578	19	Therefore, Tomasz Snarski - or a journalist interviewing him - makes the task easier. He does not try to answer the question of the relationship between the right to respect the private life of a woman and a competitive law that could be entitled to the fetus.
2578	21	In 2018, the then Ombudsman Adam Bodnar said in the context of parliamentary work on two civic projects that, for the authors, were to change the act on the conditions of admissibility of interrupting pregnancy that "abortion is not human law." It was, however, that these conditions were determined by the national legislator, because international law does not guarantee the right to abortion directly. And not that the issue of abortion is indifferent to human rights - as currently says Snarski.
2578	23	We know even from the European Court of Human Rights with the decisions of the European Rights. He noticed a long time ago that the legislation regulating the interruption of pregnancy affects the sphere of private life, because whenever a woman is pregnant, her private life becomes closely related to the developing fetus. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (guaranteeing the right to respect for private life), according to the Court, interpreted as granting the right to abortion, but the actual states resulting from the existence of a ban or access restrictions are assessed as to whether the right of a woman to respect her Private life has not been violated as a result of these prohibitions.
2578	25	Thus, it does not matter whether we consider the right to abortion as a fundamental law or not. It is important that the prohibition or limitation of this right may be a violation of a woman's rights. We will not find this information in an interview.
2578	27	"The principle of proportionality in Poland has not been adopted"
2578	29	Yes, "weighing certain values" is mentioned. Meanwhile, we are dealing with a classic and often encountered in the practice of the statement and application of the law of competition worthy of protection of goods/values/rights.
2578	31	The law has long known the instruments of resolving such conflicts. Under Polish law, such an instrument is art. 31 paragraph 1 of the Constitution. It provides that "restrictions on the use of constitutional freedoms and rights can be established only in the Act and only if they are necessary in a democratic state for its security or public order, or for the protection of the environment, health and morality of public, or freedom and the rights of other people. " The principle of proportionality expressed in it - among others - is reflected in the article 32 of the European Charter of Human Rights, and in the case -law of the European Court of Human Rights.
2578	33	A lawyer who respects the principles of craft should not lose this principle from the eyes - as an instrument for resolving the conflict of goods/interests deserving protection; as an instrument for obtaining a fair balance between such goods. It also applies when it applies to women in unwanted pregnancy, pregnancy with bad health negotiations for the woman herself and/or fetus. At least to mention her. This principle of proportionality guided national legislators, when in the second half of the 20th century they introduced in Europe and in the world laws legalizing the termination of pregnancy as a medical benefit.
2578	35	It is not without reason that constitutionalists or human rights specialists sometimes say bitterly that "the principle of proportionality in Poland did not accept" as a professional instrument of subtle and precise weighing competitive, and worthy of protection of goods and interests; as an instrument of striving for a fair decision; as a justice reflex of persons constituting and applying the law. The position presented by attorney Snarski - that any other woman's right must always give way and in every situation - it is an expression of such a disregard for the principle of proportionality. The radical nature of this position is that he treats the fetus as a man, and interrupting pregnancy as taking away his life. However, we do not learn what exactly it would have - in terms of determining the legal admissibility of interrupting pregnancy - rely on the "search for optimal solutions under non -optimal conditions" postulated by the lawyer. We also do not learn that the law can differentiate - and this does - the scope of fetal legal protection depending on the stage of pregnancy development.
2578	37	Speaking of these values ​​and interests, it is impossible not to notice that in the text devoted - among others - the legal issues of the regulation of termination of pregnancy is not a single sentence about what worthy protection of legal values ​​and interests of a woman supports the interruption Pregnancy was an available and legal medical benefit. Yes, we have a suggestion of a journalist that such a good could be "unlimited freedom of a woman", to which Snarski responds with some indignation that there is no such such as unlimited freedom - and rightly so.
2578	39	It's just that in addition to "unlimited freedom" there are other interests and good of women who may violate or destroy. For example, personal autonomy. For example, striving to shape your own fate in an intentional way. For example, a sense of responsibility for the fate of children who already have. For example, the awareness that the birth of a sick child - statistically speaking - results in Poland that about 80 percent. Men leave the family. But who would worry about such frills. It is easier to call them simply "unlimited freedom."
2578	41	Is the fetus subject to legal protection to the same extent as a human?
2578	43	Therefore, we do not find information in the text that the legal regulation of termination of pregnancy has a direct impact on whether women's rights are observed and respected. We can read for this that "from the perspective of the concept of human rights I have shared, the right to abortion is simply incomprehensible. It is difficult to explain how someone would have the right to do so, understood as a human right. Because the consequence would be to say that the fetus, or man before birth, is not a separate person. " We still read about the rights of "innocent, defenseless people, which are unborn children."
2578	45	MEC. Snarski, therefore, smoothly sneaks on the issue of fetal status, treating him as "man before birth." As if in a legal sense it was obvious. For the purposes of this text, of course, there is no need or the possibility of reporting extensive legal and philosophical literature on whether the fetus is a man in the sense that it deserves the same scope of protection as after birth. It is enough to recall that this issue was and remains the subject of serious debates and controversy. It would be elegantly to mention it, instead of presenting the matter as if the speaker's opinion - to which he has of course the right - was the same as the conclusion of this debate flowing. Because it's just not.
2578	47	In Polish legal literature, there is a fundamental work - awarded by the editors of the prestigious monthly "State and Law" for the best doctorate - about the definition of the beginnings of human life, differences in this matter between different laws and differences in international law itself. Dr. Jelena Kondratiew-Bryzik (she worked at the Center for Human Rights of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznań, died in 2012 in a railway disaster near Szczekociny) she published a thing entitled "The beginning of legal protection of human life in the light of international standards" in 2009. The author presented a careful legal analysis of the way in which various acts of international law and the case -law developed on their basis define this moment. These definitions are very diverse and cannot be brought to a simple conclusion that the fetus is simply a man who is entitled to identical legal protection against birth and after it.
2578	49	It would also not be remembered from the position of the European Court of Human Rights in this matter. According to it at the European level, "there is no consensus as to the nature and status of embryo and/or fetal (...), although they begin to receive some protection in the light of scientific progress and the potential consequences of research on genetic engineering, medically assisted procreation or experiments in embryos. At best, it can be considered a common plane of the agreement between states that the embryo/fetus belongs to the human type. The potentiality of this being and his ability to become a person - also benefiting from the protection of civil law in many countries, such as France, in the context of inheritance and donations, as well as in the United Kingdom (...) - requires protection in the name of human dignity, without making her "person" having "the right to life" within the meaning of Article 2 [European Convention on Human Rights]. " "Considering the above, the Court is convinced that it is neither desirable nor even possible in the current state of affairs to give an abstract answer to the question whether the unborn child is a person within the meaning of Art. 2 of the Convention [which guarantees the right to legal protection of life]. "
2578	51	It would be worth keeping this in mind before the court is formulated on the legal status of the fetus as categorical as it does by Snarski, and in addition - the court, which in the context of the interview can be perceived as an expert, legal theorem of facts. For people practicing legal competitions, the ability to distinguish between facts and judgments/grades belongs to the basic professional instrumentation. I have no doubt that Snarski has this skill, which his professional achievements are convincing proof. The reliability of his position would gain if he avoided this awkwardness.
2578	53	It will not refer to the important professional success of Snarski. He represented a family of victims of the Smolensk disaster before the European Court of Human Rights. The subject of the complaint was the allegation of violation of the right to respect private and family life as a result of the exhumation of the remains of victims contrary to the opposition of families. The Strasbourg Court ruled that this exhumation was such a violation. Just as the Convention does not directly guarantee the "right to abortion", it does not guarantee "the right to exhuts the body of loved ones without the consent of the family." But both are equally assessed: whether it was consistent with human rights.
2578	55	Firing acts to "inherent human dignity" are no longer enough
2578	57	I make the last attention with real regret. I have no doubt as to the sincere commitment of dr. Snarski in the idea of ​​protecting human rights. However, the interview contains a significant omission. It has, in my opinion, the value of ethical omission.
2578	59	Today, you cannot talk in Poland about the legal admissibility of termination of pregnancy, having acquired water into the mouth as to what consequences the ban on interrupting pregnancy due to fetal pathology has caused. Two stories of young pregnant women who died in hospitals are already known after the Julia Przyłębska Tribunal removed the embryopathological premise from the 1993 law. I expect from lawyers - and I consider it an important element of professional craft, often absent in Polish jurisprudence, sometimes sinning theoretical beauty - willingness and ability to reflect on what social consequences have applicable law.
2578	61	And from lawyers dealing with human rights I expect that they want and can see the real consequences of applicable legal norms for the lives of real people. That they do not content with soaring files to "inherent human dignity", which in the face of the horror of today's situation of Polish women sound like buzzing copper.
2579	1	Catharyna: Why should abortion be morally neutral?
2579	3	Girls' girls: "text» I support, but I would never do an abortion myself "emphasizes that abortions are something bad, something that should be avoided, something that should be as little as possible. What do you really want to say, saying this sentence? Is it not about protecting yourself against the assessment of others? "
2579	5	The struggle of pro-abortion environments-because calling them pro-choice has long become obsolete-about the legalization of abortion quickly went from the stage "no one says that abortion is not good" to the stage "let no one say that abortion is bad". Now they force you to refrain from moral assessments of abortion, regardless of what was the reason and at what time it was done. It is to be morally neutral, even if the pregnancy is already so advanced that the child is able to live independently outside the mother's body. After all, it is still a fetus and the right to talk about it as a stuffing for dumplings, the progressive left will defend as independence.
2579	7	Representatives of the abortion dream team write that "abortion is one of the methods of fertility control, just as important as contraception, and there is no reason for politicians, medicine or market imposing to us what a better way to protect against unwanted pregnancy." The right to abortion in certain circumstances, but they have the audacity to say that they would not give up abortion themselves, the right to recognize themselves as supporters of the choice. Because today pro-icice is no longer a fight for the right to abortion. It is a fight for the ban on her moral valuation. This is only contraception, just as morally neutral as condoms. Thus, abortion lobbyists confirm what they were - apparently harmful - criticized. Abortion for them is like cutting nails. And it's not about changing the law, but about permanent gagging otherwise thinking. It's good that we have clarity.
2579	9	Do you know how a taboo was broken in America, what was the smoking of cigarettes by women in public places? The advertising agency working for cigarette producers organized on Easter 1929 a "spontaneous" march of women called the torches of freedom. They passed the fifth avenue in New York, convinced by greedy millionaires that they were fighting for their freedom when they actually fought for (and won) to multiply profits Tobacco corporations. For themselves they only won the fact that today lung cancer is the second malignant tumor in women. I wonder if today marketers from pharmaceutical corporations have their own participation in the bottom -up movement of convincing that abortion is freedom. Women on waves - An organization operating for the right to abortion in countries where it is banned - they take 70–90 euros for a miscarriage of "donations" as a miscarriage. It is a potentially giant market if you can completely break taboos.
2583	1	Pro-life voice: religious, philosophical, legal, biological and social arguments against abortion
2583	3	Abortion has been one of the most dividing people of social problems for many years. Everyone speaks about it - from religious institutions, through biologists and ethics, to philosophers. Often, however, the opinions are lacking in arguments that can speak to an average citizen. Nothing results from such empty words. In the article below we will present the reasons why abortion - especially "on demand" - should be stigmatized. To start with, some definition issues should be clarified. Because there is no medical term that would clearly refer to all stages of the body's development between conception and delivery, for the purposes of the following text we consider that in this context we will interchangeably use the terms "fetus" and "[unborn] child", if from a given provision It does not appear otherwise.
2583	5	What is pro-life?
2583	7	Supporters of restrictive abortion law are determined by the term pro-life. Although in common opinion they are in favor of a total ban on abortion, in fact the environment is not homogeneous. Part of the pro-life movement allows the termination of pregnancy in special cases (e.g. when the life of the mother's life), while others even talk against artificial methods of regulation of conception (e.g. hormonal contraception). It is much safer to say that the overall goal of this environment is not so much absolutely outlawing abortion as to minimize the frequency of performing treatments. This can be achieved both by tightening the law (if the current one seems too liberal) and maintaining the status quo (e.g. if the government is trying to liberalize existing entries). Pro-life does not want to allow the situation of social consent to abortion, which in consequence could turn into further and uncontrolled shift of deciding about human life or death.
2583	9	I. Religious authorities are consistent
2583	11	In Poland, about 94% of citizens are people of Roman Catholic religion (after the publication of the Central Statistical Office "Religious Confessions in Poland 2012–2014"). This does not mean, of course, as some people think - that the remaining 6% must blindly comply with the morality imposed by the majority. However, since so many of us recognize the teachings of the Church, it is worth finding out what the holy books and people who we consider authorities think about abortion.
2583	13	Decalogue and Catechism of the Catholic Church
2583	15	You don't have to look far, because the Decalogue says directly: don't kill. The fifth commandment protects everyone's life from conception to natural death, hence the position of Catholics is unchanged and clear - both in terms of abortion and euthanasia. However, as we know (or at least we should know), biblical entries should not always be treated literally. Let's refer to the "Catechism of the Catholic Church" - the official interpretation of the doctrine of the faith and the principles of the morality of the Church, written in a simple language, understandable to each language and published in 1992. Therefore, this is a relatively new document and approved by the then Pope, John Paul II. The fifth commandment of the decalogue mentioned earlier is developed here in nearly 80 points, but we are particularly interested in only six of them: points from 2270 to 2275 concern specifically the issue of termination of pregnancy. So how does "catechism" refer to this issue? Already at 2270 points we get a clear and comprehensive answer:
2583	17	Human life from the moment of conception should be respected and protected in an absolute way. From the first moment of its existence, the human being should have the rights of people granted, among them the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.
2583	19	Further points develop this thesis: from the beginning the church claimed that it was moral evil every caused by breaking pregnancy. Teaching on this subject has not changed and remains unchanged. Direct termination of pregnancy, that is, intended as a goal or agent, is deeply contrary to moral law (2271). "Catechism" cites here, among others On "Didache", one of the oldest Christian texts: you will not kill the fetus by stopping pregnancy or kill the newborn (Didache 2.2).
2583	21	Formal cooperation in interrupting pregnancy is a serious offense. The church imposes an excommunication for this crime against human life. Who causes pregnancy, after an effect, is subject to excommunications binding by the power of the law itself, by the mere fact of committing a crime, under the conditions provided for by law (2272). The inalienable right to the lives of every innocent human being is a constitutive element of civil society and its legislation: the inalienable rights of a person should be recognized and respected by civil society and political power. (...) Among these basic laws, the right to life and physical integrity of every human being from the moment of conception to death should include (...) the right to life and physical integrity. (...) An expression of respect and care due to a child, starting from the moment of its conception, should be provided by legislation by appropriate criminal sanctions for each voluntary violation of his rights (2273). Some of the home -grown critics of anti -abortion law claim that Roman Catholic doctrine does not allow any intervention during pregnancy, including prenatal testing. This is obviously a great nonsense, as the last two points say: because the embryo should be considered a person from the moment of conception, his integrity should be defended, care for him and treat him as far as any other human being. Prenatal diagnostics is morally allowed if "respects the life and integrity of the embryo and human fetus, strives to protect it or to its individual treatment (...) opposes the moral law when, depending on the results, it leads to termination of pregnancy. Diagnostics should not entail a death sentence (2274). Like any medical procedure on the patient, it should be considered as permissible treatments in the human embryo, provided that they respect the life and integrity of the embryo, without exposing it to the risk of disproportionately great; when they are undertaken to treat, improve his health or to save an endangered life (2275).
2583	23	So what are the conclusions of reading the "Catechism of the Catholic Church"? Human life has been protected from conception, abortion is undoubtedly bad and immoral, prenatal tests and treatments in embryos are most allowed, unless they threaten the life of the mother and the child.
2583	25	Mother Teresa and John Paul II
2583	27	Mother Teresa of Calcutta - one of the most influential figures in the history of world peace - also spoke very critically about abortion. A fragment of her speech on the occasion of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 is often quoted: Abortion is the greatest danger that threatens peace today. If a mother is allowed to kill his own child, what can he stop you and me so that we do not kill each other? The unborn children are the poorest of the poorest. Finally, let's return to John Paul II. Three years after the approval of the "Catechism of the Catholic Church", the Pope announced "Evangelium Vitae", an encyclical of the value and inviolability of human life. He condemned abortion as a cruel crime:
2583	29	All kinds of murder, genocide, fetal spending, euthanasia and voluntary suicide (...) All these and similar matters and practices are something shameful; By infecting human civilization, they are more disgraced by those who commit them than those who experience harm and are most contrary to the reverence of the Creator due.
2583	31	John Paul II also said that in the case of internally unfair law, which is the law allowing the termination of pregnancy and euthanasia, you must never use it "or participate in shaping public opinion favorable to such law, or show him support in voting." It is worth noting that many Catholics treat the teachings of the Church very selectively, treating them as an excuse only in strictly defined issues. This is not what real faith is all about. According to religious authorities, it is only when it fits our beliefs, we distort the idea of ​​religion. The church's position is and has always been clear: abortion is absolute and absolute evil.
2583	33	Abortion in other religions
2583	35	What about the other six percent, which this interpretation does not apply to? Other religions are also critical of abortion.
2583	37	Various breaks of Christianity
2583	39	Orthodoxy, like Catholicism, shares the view that human life begins at the time of conception. Abortion is therefore treated as a murder. There are many Protestant faces a similar opinion, mainly orthodox. The largest Protestant church in Poland, the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in the Republic of Poland, in the 1991 statement strongly in favor of protecting his life from the moment of conception and opposed the use of early-coronary funds. Churches associated in the Evangelical Alliance are also against abortion. The unconditional opponent of abortion is the southern Baptist convention.
2583	41	Jehovah's Witnesses are talking against abortion: God considers his life saint. He looks at the embryo like a separate human being. King David, under inspiration, wrote about God: "Your eyes even saw my embryo" (Psalm 139: 16). At one time, God said that who would hurt the unborn child, he would be held responsible. So in God's eyes, killing such a child is a murder (exits 20:13; 21:22, 23).
2583	43	Buddhism
2583	45	Although Buddhism does not have an official interpretation regarding abortion, many monastery codes - citing traditional letters - recognize the moment of conception as the beginning of human life. For this reason, abortion, as a conscious destruction of this life, is treated as something bad. The Theeravades and Wadjrajana are excluded from the order for help in making an abortion. The current Dalai Lama, saying that it is a murder act, so according to science, should also be in favor of a negative view of abortion, so it should be stigmatized. It is also worth mentioning that traditional Buddhist magazines do not record differences in the approach to early and late abortion - each case is associated with negative moral or karmic consequences.
2583	47	Hinduism
2583	49	Traditional Hindu texts condemn abortion. This crime is treated, depending on the sources, on an equal footing of a violation of purity (Mahanarajana Upaniszad), as worse than killing his own parents (Kauszitaki Upaniszad), and even equal to killing the priest not the heaviest). The woman who has made an abortion, in turn, is threatened with the loss of caste status. The abortion itself is called Bhrūṇahatya (fetal murder), and the person who made it - Bhrūṇahan (killer of the learned brain). In Hinduism, life begins from the moment of conception. Abortion, therefore, causes the death of a man, and this agrees in the principle principle of faith, Ahimsa (the term literally means "non -disposal").
2583	51	Religions say firm abortion "no"
2583	53	Most of the significant religions have a clear and negative position on abortion. Human life begins from the moment of conception, so every interference causing the death of an embryo or fetus is in one way or another. It is worth noting that in most cases the murder of an unborn child is treated at least on an equal footing - and sometimes even as a heavier crime - than the murder of a born person. Of course, which has already been marked earlier, we should absolutely not impose other morals resulting from our religion, but if we confess a given faith, we should live in accordance with its guidelines - and those in the case of abortion are usually clear.
2583	55	II. The law protects the fetus
2583	57	The issue of abortion is not regulated by EU law, so it is responsible for member states.
2583	59	Constitution of the Republic of Poland
2583	61	In the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of April 2, 1997 we read: The Republic of Poland provides every person with legal protection of life (Article 38) and everyone is equal before the law (Article 32 (1)). So it remains only to define the moment when a man arises. The constitution does not answer this question (primarily because it is a general act), but the Constitutional Tribunal - and yes. In the decision of May 28, 1997 (reference number K 26/96) we read:
2583	63	The value of the constitutionally protected legal good, which is human life, including life developing in the prenatal phase, cannot be differentiated. There is no sufficiently precise and justified criteria to allow such diversity depending on the development phase of human life. Since its inception, human life has become a constitutionally protected value. This also applies to prenatal phase.
2583	65	This position was also maintained 7 years later (judgment of January 7, 2004, reference number K 14/03): All possible doubts as to the protection of human life should be resolved for this protection (in Dubio Pro Vita Humana). This means that human life - you can notice a clear analogy for religious interpretations - it starts from the moment of conception, and if it is not known whether the action (here: abortion) interferes with the protection of this life, it should be assumed that this is the case.
2583	67	Convention on Children's Rights
2583	69	And if the Polish interpretation-according to pro-choice environments, contaminated by Catholic thinking-this is not enough, let's reach for a much broader document: Convention on Children's Rights. This agreement was ratified by Poland as early as 1991, and what is more, it was Poland who proposed the UN Human Committee on its adoption and presented the project. The convention repeats in its provisions the postulate adopted in 1959 of the Declaration of Children's Rights: the child, due to its physical and mental immaturity, requires special care and care, including proper legal protection, both before and after birth. The last fragment is important because it also gives the rights to the child in the womb. The convention does not clearly specify the moment when the child begins. So again, you can refer to the principle in Dubio Pro Vita Humana - a legal protection against birth is a sufficient condition to recognize that the body is subject to this protection from the moment of conception, not an imaginary point on the time axis.
2583	71	III. Uncertain position of biologists
2583	73	The biological point of view has one basic disadvantage: even supporters of abortion admit that it is impossible to clearly determine at what time of development we are dealing with man. So they resort to such abstract concepts as the identification of humanity with consciousness, independence from the mother's body, with the feeling of pain or simply set a certain arbitrary age of the fetus, after exceeding which we have full rights of life, and before crossing it - no rights. This type of argument is not only funny, but even ignorant selective - which will be more broadly at a point on philosophical issues. Let's leave this thesis without proof. Let's turn off emotions, turn on thinking and approach the matter rationally. In a simplified way, we can recognize - regardless of our views on the issue of abortion - that every living being is a collection of genes and this is a very strictly defined collection. Man (again for simplification, we skip, for example, genetic diseases as irrelevant to proof) has 46 chromosomes - 23 from the Father and 23 from the mother. Since human reproductive cells can only come into contact with other human reproductive cells (despite ambitious attempts, scientists failed to fertilize even biologically closest relatives of homo sapiens), it is obvious to say that the body was formed as a result of male interactions and female human gamete and having 46 chromosomes is human. The 80-year-old old man has 46 chromosomes. The 18-year-old has 46 chromosomes. The newborn baby has 46 chromosomes. A three -month fetus has 46 chromosomes. So you should ask the question: how many chromosomes does a newly created embryo have? Of course, we all know the answer. There are 46 of them - already at the time of the zygote has a full set of chromosomes. At the DNA level, even zygote - and even more so embryo and fetus - are therefore equivalent to a adult. Since killing the latter is evil, why is it justified by killing his earlier form? Scientific, not emotional, therefore, the approach to biology confirms religious and legal arguments. We de facto become a concept. Not after delivery, not as a fetus, not as an embryo, but after fertilization. Therefore, in the light of applicable law, we deserve the same protection as an adult. Another argument cited by the pro-choice environments is that the fetus or embryo was an integral part of the mother's body, because it develops inside it and is connected to her umbilical cord. You can't be further from the truth. The child is an absolutely separate being - he has separate organs (when they are produced), often a different blood group, and above all - and here we return to the scientific essence of humanity - another genetic code. Two different DNA codes always give two separate organisms. It is even more absurd to refer to the "existential dependence of the fetus on the mother" and the symbiotic relationship. Existently dependent, the weaker Siamese twin may be dependent. Does this give the right to a stronger twin - as the one who somehow "mother" - to decide about the fate of the weaker? So why do we allow a mother to do it?
2583	75	IV. Society less and less favorable abortions
2583	77	Since the introduction of the law of 1993, the attitudes of Poles have become more and more conservative. In 2006, an advantage of abortion over supporters was noted for the first time. In 2009, every third Pole allowed the possibility of interrupting pregnancy. Four years later - only every fourth. The trend of moving away from abortion on demand is increasingly visible from year to year.
2583	79	The CBOS message "Admissibility of abortion in various situations" of May 2016 clearly indicates that Poles are against killing unborn children. As many as 65% of respondents believe that the underage of their mother is not an argument allowing abortion. Only every fifth Pole has a different opinion. There is even less social consent for abortion due to the difficult personal (80% against) or material (81% against) situation.
2583	81	Interestingly, the income per person in the household does not significantly differentiate the opinions about interrupting pregnancy due to the poor financial situation. People with income at most PLN 649 per capita are 80% against abortion in this case, and people with an income of PLN 1000-1399-in 84%. This deals with the statement that those who cannot directly affect the most opposing. Respondents with lower income also speak negatively about abortion among people with similar financial status. As reported by the message: In view of the admissibility of abortion in a situation where a woman simply does not want to have a child, 54% of people are definitely opposite. In total, 12% of Poles declare that abortion should then be acceptable and 78% are of the opposite opinion. Opinions about abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy (without indicating a reason) are similar. Three -quarters of the respondents (74%) believe that termination of pregnancy should not be permissible and 13% is willing to accept them.
2583	83	Therefore, it is clear that over the years Polish society has matured and gained awareness. The number of opponents of termination of pregnancy is systematically growing. In popular opinion, this is a morally reprehensible phenomenon that there is no public consent. We live in a democratic country, and this implies two important issues: respect for decisions made with the will of the majority (since the vast majority treats abortion as evil - like any other murder - directed against other people, this should be reflected in law); Respect for the weaker side (in this case the weaker side is unborn children who should be protected).
2583	85	Social pathologies resulting from the legalization of abortion
2583	87	Society is against abortion on demand because it confirms pathological behavioral patterns. Treating a child like a goods that must be free from flaws (and yet the smallest physical or mental disability is already an argument for stopping pregnancy) in a straight line leads to abortion for other reasons - inadequate sex (in India selective abortion is already a fact), eye color , presence of one or another recessive gene. If the unborn child does not match our idealized image of a descendant, it is easier to "scrape" than to have, for example, a red son instead of a blond -haired daughter. Hence only a step to a negative eugenics, an example of which we had in the first half of the 20th century just below our nose. Is it not because he is born deaf or with Down syndrome from taking our unborn child to life or with Down syndrome, are we not in a sense continuators of the German T4 action?
2583	89	VI. Abortion and a demographic problem
2583	91	It is assumed that the replacement of generations can be talked about when the fertility rate oscillates within 2.1. In Poland, we have been dealing with demographic lowlands for a long time - and not just any. According to "The World FactBook" for 2015, the fertility rate in Poland was only 1.33 - it was 215 a result in the world from among 224 countries. This means that from generation to generation the population of Poles decreases by one third. The implications of the low fertility rate are easy to predict and visible now. As reported by the CSO report "Population forecast for 2014-2050": a smaller fertility means fewer children born, which in turn leads to a decrease in the percentage of young people in the population, which results in increasing social benefits to older people, deterioration, deterioration the economic situation of young people and as a result the maintenance of low fertility or their decline.
2583	93	- This phenomenon is called a low fertility trap. Of course, no need to add that one of the sources of this state of affairs is abortions. In 2014 - according to the report of the Council of Ministers - nearly 1,000 such procedures were carried out in Poland. Of course, this number applies only to legal cases, which are only the vertex of the iceberg. Proponents of the Pro-Choice movement estimate the scale of the abortion underground on up to 200,000 treatments a year. This is over half of the number of live births in 2014. If this practice was limited to individual cases, the fertility rate would approach the value of 2.0.
2583	95	Legalization (not) a recipe for everything
2583	97	Of course, you can raise your voice that the forbidden fruit tastes best (somewhere in this statement lurks a very perverse joke), and the best method of fighting the abortion underground - and thus with a low natural increase - is ... full legalization of abortion. You can refer to prohibition in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, which completely disturbed the state. It's just that life is not as easy as it seems to some. Abortion is not - contrary to the belief of certain environments - a necessity. It's a luxury. Erasing - and again from behind the corner looks a black humor - mistakes of the previous evening, week or month. Many aspects of life are banned by law, and yet we have not fallen into ruin. The streets are not full of drunk in junior high school students (after all, alcohol is allowed from the age of 18), and herooinists do not sit notoriously in the staircase. If, in fact, the source of all evil were to ban, each of us would have a moonshine, a composition with ammunition and a camper for the production of methamphetamine. However, this does not happen. Permission for the sale of their own production alcohol will not make people stop drinking. Legalization of abortion will not cause the underground to disappear.
2583	99	Does abortion protect against overpopulation?
2583	101	The myth is also-so eagerly cited by pro-choice environments-the threat of overcrowding the world. The fertility rate on a globe scale is only ... 2.42 (according to "The World FactBook"). It is true that in the 20th century we recorded a huge jump in the population - from 1.6 to over 6 billion - but now this growth is no longer exponential. It is estimated that in 2100 there will be "only" 11 billion, so only 4 billion more than today. If it is also possible to improve living conditions in the poorest regions of the world - mainly in Africa - this factor should still fall. After all, as many as 32 of 33 leaders in the ranking are on this continent - and the last of them, Madagascar, has a indicator twice as high as required for the replacement of generations. Improving living conditions would certainly cause it to reduce, because it would involve less dying of children and extend the expected age of survival.
2583	103	VII. Picture regret - do women have remorse?
2583	105	The monograph "abortion-between ideology and individual experience" by Ewelina Wejbert-Wąsiewicz (recognized by the Polish Sociological Society as the best scientific book in the field of sociology in 2011) shows that this procedure has undoubted influence-and this negative impact-on the later life of the would-be parents. The book presents a list of the causes of abortion along with the degree of "post -abortion regret".
2583	107	It is clearly seen that the vast majority of cases are accompanied by pathological regret - this means that abortion is not indifferent to women and causes more severe than lighter feelings. On the online forum addressed to women after abortion, based on which the above table was created, including Such statements (original spelling): (...) I cut my hands with despair and powerlessness (...) My child ... Let it forgive me, I hope I will fix it all ... that God will help me ... as I could disappoint ... (...) I I killed ... I deserve to die (...) I want to have a child ... give him this love ... I would give my life for one more chance! The whole situation does not help the fact that in Poland there is no good, professional psychological help and gynecological care. The post -abortion suffering of women is therefore even stronger than it could be while maintaining the appropriate level of medical services (which, however, does not imply at all that less suffering justify the procedure of termination of pregnancy). On the other hand, the monograph also mentions cases when women did not feel any fault because of his act. Abortion for them was a cosmetic procedure, like a peeling of exfoliating epidermis. If they had become pregnant again, without a blink of an eye would deprive another fetus.
2583	109	If not abortion, what?
2583	111	Foster family
2583	113	The first solution that comes as an alternative to abortion is a foster family. It is said that this is a very difficult, complex and long procedure, but from the intervention report of the pre -trade center (March 2013) it follows that as many as 97% of pupils went to the family environment - including over 91% to foster and natural families. The average time to stay in the child left by the mother in the hospital is only 61 days. In a situation where every fifth marriage has problems getting pregnant, taking a child to adopt seems to solve several issues at the same time - limits the scale of abortion, allows a child to live (which in itself is not guilty of anything) and allows him to bring him up to people who For various reasons, they cannot have biological offspring.
2583	115	Window of Life
2583	117	Mothers who want to renounce their own child can be frightened by the openness of their data. In the hospital, you need to sign the appropriate papers and expose yourself to the label (in this respect we are still stuck in the deep Middle Ages) of the Mother. So if not explicit adoption, maybe the so -called Windows of life? The window of life is a place where the mother can leave an anonymously infant - opened from the outside, heated, with adequate ventilation. Its opening launches the signaling, which informs the person on duty about the appearance of the child. Then just put them in an incubator, notify the hospital, conduct research (and with them the procedures for giving identity and adoption process) and wait for the family interested. Windows of life may not be a particularly common solution - according to the Opoka Foundation from 2006 to 2013, they saved only 64 children - but every life is at a premium. Each child in the window of life is one child less in a cabbage barrel.
2583	119	Reasonable education
2583	121	However, this is only - or as much as - ad hoc actions. As Parumia, Morbum Evitare Quam Curare Facilius EST - says to Hippocrates - prevention is better than cure. How is it best to prevent abortion? In the same, which can prevent unwanted pregnancies (and not, we still consider abortion as a method of contraception): through appropriate sex education. The secret of the polyszynela-although in 21st-century Europe very terrifying-is that the majority of unplanned concepts results from ignorance of your own body. Myths like "if I pull out, you won't get" or "the first time you can't get pregnant" - and even such unbelievable "methods" of contraception as jumping on one leg after intercourse to shake sperm from the body - they are still present in the minds of society . This is due to the treatment of sex as a taboo subject - especially in intergenerational relationships - as well as from the inadequate approach of institutions shaping us in school years. Therefore, we gain sex education in contacts with peers, on pornographic pages and in the section with letters to the editorial office of popular youth magazines. By creating a reasonable educational program in schools, we have a much greater chance to fertilize the minds of young people before these youth hastily fertilize their bodies. This, of course, requires effort - an effort incomparably greater than the statutory prohibition of abortion practices and introducing conscience clauses at every stage, from a gynecologist to a lady in the pharmacy - but if we want to have a healthy state, this effort cannot be avoided.
2583	123	Awareness of your deeds
2583	125	Naturally, it would also be not true to say that every abortion is a depravation in every respect. Certainly, sometimes justified premises when the termination of pregnancy is caused by a higher good. Certainly, for this higher good is not the earlier lack of the brain in the future would -be parent (because once that the child is not guilty of anything here, and two that you have to take responsibility for his actions) or the so -called "Slip -up" (as above). When deciding on intercourse - even if in practice, hormones, not gray cells manage our behavior - one should be aware of possible consequences. Solving a potential Post Factum problem through a procedure or an early -coronary tablet is as authorized as a policeman who stopped us for drunk driving.
2583	127	And above all reason
2583	129	And everything comes down to this. Appropriate sex education, treatment of the fetus as a man, not a new toy model (a child with suspected physical disability or, for example, Down syndrome is in principle qualify for surgery - because of our history you do not even have to say the name of a man who had very similar views; Do we really want to be this leader with a specific mustache on a micro scale?), Taking consistency for your actions - only so much or so much, just to work out a reasonable compromise. The anti -abortion act will then counteract pathology, just like the Act on Upbringing in Sobriety prevents extreme cases, not a conscious citizen who wants to drink a glass of wine for dinner.
259	1	OSW expert: Russian troll factories try to show Ukrainian refugees in a negative light.
259	3	"Issues in Polish-Ukrainian relations, especially historical objects, are willingly used by Russian propaganda to conflict Poles and Ukrainians," said Katarzyna Chawryło, an expert in the Warsaw Center for Eastern Studies (OSW) in the conversation. She added that the Kremlin propagandists are trying to reach all EU countries with a negative message about refugees.
259	5	So -called Troll factories also reach and will reach in the coming months after the content showing in the negative light of Ukrainian refugees in Poland - she added.
259	9	The exploitation of threads about Ukrainian citizens escaping west has a wider dimension and is not only related to Poland. Propagandists are trying to reach societies in EU countries, distributing the content that would show that refugees are a source of threat - this is to lead to the situation that they will not (refugees - the company RMF fm) welcome. The current situation (war of Russia with Ukraine - note RMF FM) causes that rhetoric aimed at refugees is an important element in the Kremlin disinformation message. Its primary goal is to minimize Western support for Ukraine - stressed Khawryło.
259	11	The Russian narrative breaks down in a significant way in Hungary, in Serbia, partly in Germany.
259	13	In the assessment of Russian analytics, the so -called Troll factories (state -controlled companies dealing in publishing propaganda content on the Internet, mainly on forums and in social networks - note RMF FM) still employ new people, which indicates the intensification of the Kremlin's activities in the sphere of information struggle.
259	15	The expert emphasized that the Kremlin's many years of investing in favorable expert and media circles in the West does not bring the assumed results. The war with Ukraine completely changed the situation, even turned it upside down. First of all, the scale and brutality of Russian crimes on civilians in Ukraine are obvious and difficult to defend. Secondly, the Sanctions of the EU and the USA aimed at Russian media, resulting in limiting their broadcasting in Western countries, significantly reduced the scope of propaganda. As for European countries, the Russian narrative, however, breaks in significant in Hungary and Serbia, partly also in Germany - she assessed Khawryło.
259	17	Trips that some journalists willingly use.
259	19	The interlocutor drew attention to the "utility" of some Western journalists in the regime message of Russian television.
259	21	The Kremlin organizes studio trips for such people to occupied areas, e.g. to Mariupol. Recently, they have participated in them, among others Journalists from Germany and France, which was reported by Russian television. These are representatives of niche media, but their presence is enough to build a propaganda message on "objective Western reporters on the Kremlin television, seeking the truth, despite the censorship prevailing in the West"- said the analyst.
259	23	Do the Russians trust television? The results of the survey are not reliable.
259	25	According to the expert of the Warsaw center, the study of Russian public opinion published in recent days, conducted by the international company Groupm and showing the decrease in the trust of the Russians to state television, should not be treated as representative. The study was valuable because it confirmed the trend visible for years - television remains for the Russians the main source of information, but trust in it decreases. However, only respondents from large cities, over 100,000, took part in this survey. residents, therefore the results cannot be treated as reliable. In the Russian province, where Putin enjoys the greatest support, television plays a big role than in urban centers - explained the analyst.
259	27	The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach residents with "appropriate" content.
259	29	Khawryło also referred to the propaganda "cover" of Russian actions in occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine.
259	31	The invaders do not disseminate any subtle message there, but focus on strictly strength solutions to intimidate the inhabitants. This scheme includes Turning off Ukrainian television and replacing it with Russian programs, as well as destroying access to Ukrainian internet connections and mobile networks. The aggressor uses every opportunity to reach residents with "appropriate" pro -Russian content - e.g. there are reports of the distribution of "Komsomolian truth" (a journal publishing propaganda content) together with humanitarian aid - emphasized the OSW expert.
2590	1	ZCHR to Solidarna Polska: Together, let's organize public space by getting rid of the symbols of foreign power
2590	3	- Today we are transferring this project to solidarity Poland, which, having 20 deputies, can report it to the Marshal's Laska, so that from spring 2023 no obstacle facility remained in public space, which celebrates the Red Army, and the Second Army of the "Polish Army", the People's Army Polish or even Otto von Bismarck. Current solutions enable the defense of glory objects by numerous local governments, e.g. Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn. If the parliament adopts our project, on January 1, 2023, all such facilities would be in the ownership supervision of the competent voivode and if they are currently in the register of monuments they will be removed from it. This will allow you to remove these objects. Naturally, this project is also a commensurable reaction to the removal of Polish flags from Polish war cemeteries in Mednoje and Katyn by the Russians. Importantly, the objects of foreign glory in question will no longer be protected as monuments, and therefore will not be covered by the disposition of Art. 261 of the Penal Code. We count on favor in this matter by Solidarity Poland - says Paweł Czyż, spokesman for the unification of Christian families. Interview with a spokesman for ZCHR.
2590	5	Independent Gazeta Obywatelska: Mr. spokesman, where does such an initiative come from?
2590	7	ZCHR spokesman Paweł Czyż: Well, the army of the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine. At the same time, some local governments defend monuments of gratitude to the Red Army, e.g. the authorities of the Lewin Brzeski or Olsztyn commune. Such actions must be interrupted, and hundreds of totalitarian symbols as well as Prussian militarism removed. Few people know that in Polish territory we still have so -called „wieże Bismarcka”, tj. obiekty wybudowane ku upamiętnieniu kanclerza Rzeszy Ottona von Bismarcka, np. w Działdowie, w Dzierżoniowie, na Jańskiej Górze, w Lęborku, w Mrągowie, w Okonku, w Ostródzie, w Szczecinie, w Świdwinie, w Świebodzinie, in Wieluń, in Sobótka, in Zielona Góra, Żagań and Żary. It is mockery that all these symbols litter our cities. Also, the Polish People's Army does not deserve commemoration. On September 17, 1939, the USSR actually became a participant in World War II as an ally of the Third Reich. Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski expressed the view that Russia betrayed, going to help the Germans and hit us at a knife arranged with them in the back: "(...) From now on we are at war with the Soviets on an equal footing with Germany." On April 25, 1943, Stalin broke off relations with a legal Polish government. It should be mentioned that the President of the Republic of Poland Władysław Raczkiewicz refused to sign the agreement of July 30, 1941 Sikorski-Majski, and therefore re-entering the territory of the Second Polish Army in 1944-45 took place without the formal consent of the legal Polish government, i.e. it was the implementation of premises of unlawful occupation. In June 1943, the Commander -in -Chief and Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, General Władysław Sikorski, recognized the Berling army as a "Polish communist division, of a subversive nature", his creator himself as "a traitor who deserted from the Polish army." Since we do not commemorate Polnische Wermacht-the Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Poland created under the act of November 5 in the period from April 10, 1917, when Austria-Hungary transferred the Polish auxiliary corps under the orders of the General Governor of Warsaw Hans Hartwig von Beseler, until October 13, 1918. - It has no reason to commemorate in public space the so -called And whether the Second Army of the "Polish Army" or the Polish People's Army. Dot. What is very important, no one will race for their alleged damage under Art. 261 of the Penal Code.
2590	9	NGO: You are counting on the support of Solidarity Poland. But what about PiS?
2590	11	Paweł Czyż: It remains to be seen, but some Law and Justice politicians were susceptible to the legend of communists, that Berling's army is our Polish armed forces. It happens that PiS politicians lay flowers under the monuments and the Second Army of the "Polish Army". It is said that Poles served in this formation. This is clear, but no part of the "Polish Army" Army is generally due to the Second Army. It is as if we were officially constantly undermining the position of legal Polish authorities in London. Time to organize historical facts and we hope that parliamentarians of Solidarity Poland "behave as it should be." It is worth emphasizing that on the monuments of the Red Army in Mikolin, in the Lewin Brzeski commune or in Olsztyn, MP Janusz Kowalski from Sp. Therefore, we appeal to the party of Zbigniew Ziobro: together let's organize public space getting rid of symbols of foreign power.
2591	1	German MP: You have to go back to talks with Russia about the launch of Nord Stream 2
2591	3	"The federal government (in Berlin) must now do everything to ensure energy supply. You have to talk to Russia, despite the war breaking international law, about the commissioning of Nord Stream 2 to operate for a specific time, if you cannot guarantee gas supply in a different way, "said Ernst.
2591	5	"A break in gas supply could irreversibly damage + industrial spine + Germany," he added. In his opinion, the actions taken by the Minister of Economy Robert Habeck will not solve the problem, because "other countries are not able to fully compensate for gas supply" at a level comparable to supplies from Russia.
2591	7	"Energy sanctions do not work. (...) On the contrary: energy sanctions are beneficial for Russia. (...) The explosion of the prices of raw materials such as oil and gas means that Russia earns more energy than before, "said Ernst.
2591	9	As the leftist's politician argues, "maintaining sanctions in this way is immoral" because "Russia is still earning well on its raw materials, and our citizens and our economy suffer from a completely wrong sanction policy." "We should only take measures that really lead to the end of the war and do not hurt our own citizens," sums up Ernst. (PAP)
2594	1	Japanese about the war in Ukraine. Just shock ...
2594	3	Free translation, eternity;
2594	5	Hiroyuki Hamada
2594	7	I would repeat as many times as necessary. The Western establishment overthrew the Ukrainian government with the help of the Nazis in 2014 to cause a replacement war against Russia. Most Western people bought an explicit lie that Russia unpredictated Ukraine, while in reality Ukraine mercilessly bombarded the Russian -speaking population, massacre, mutilating and depriving it of livelihood for the last 8 years. Many of us have raised our votes in this matter just to be called "Putin lover", "Russian bots" and so on. Meanwhile, the pawns of the Western war against Russia are still dying in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government, supported by the US, sends unprocessed civilians to the front line between 18 and 60 years old. Do you know what this means?
2594	9	I am 54 years old and I have a son who is 18 years old. We would die for Western imperialism if we were Ukrainians. The Ukrainian establishment murders his own officials, journalists and anyone who stands against their path of Western imperialism, while continuing the slaughter of Russian -speaking Eastern Ukrainians as "separatists". Here's what "stand with Ukraine". This means subsidizing the Western defense industry, turning peacefully concomitant nations into killing each other, restructuring the economy to accept Western oligarchs and sell public property to these predators. People may think that this is only a harmless signaling of the virtue to prove how "good" you are in their communities to repeat the current imperial slogan, but people actually suffer and die of this. The same happened all over the planet. I come from Japan. I have relatives there. What happens to Ukraine can become with any Asian country supported by the US, because China is the original goal of the Empire. I feel the sadness and pain of Ukrainians, Russians and all people who suffer from imperial US violence.
2594	11	Breaking news:
2594	13	Shinzo Abe - former prime minister of Japan - was shot at Na Na Na Nara in Japan. It is quite shocking, partly because it is Japan, where such things are rare, and he is the grandson of the war criminal from World War II Kishi Nobusuke, who also became the prime minister after the war. Their political party - a liberal democratic party - is known for being supported by the CIA. Shinzo Abe was known for his sympathy for a Russian position on the war in Ukraine.
2595	1	13 million people in the corner of Africa will suffer hunger because of global warming - Strike Information Portal
2595	3	It will be a definitely difficult year for Africa, and forecasts as to the level of its difficulty from month to month are becoming more and more pessimistic. According to the UN, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya will suffer the most.
2595	5	327 million dollars-so much money will need a UN world food program (WFP) to meet the most urgent living needs in the coming months and help rural communities become more and more resistant to becoming more and more atmospheric shocks. The most exposed to hunger defeat is the corner of Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.
2595	7	3 years without rain
2595	9	In all three of these countries, no rain has been seen for 3 years, which results in the largest drought since 1981.
2595	11	"The crops are destroyed, breeding animals die, hunger grow, and all this because of repeated drought that affects the corner of Africa," says the regional director of the WFP of East Africa, Michael Dunford. Dunford warns that without proper humanitarian aid, the Somalian humanitarian crisis from 2011 may be repeated, when 250,000 people were starved. And this is unfortunately not excluded, because the average rainfall instead of growing, according to forecasts, is to fall.
2595	13	The critical situation is in the south-eastern part of Ethiopia-according to UNICEF, as many as 6 million people from these areas may need humanitarian help by mid-March this year. In the neighboring Somalia, this number is to exceed up to 7 million.
2595	15	Africa collects what we have
2595	17	Despite being a continent, which the least of all contributes to global warming, Africa feels the hardest climate change and suffers the most serious consequences for them. Drought in the corner of Africa is the best example. Over the past 100 years, surface temperatures in Africa have increased from 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. According to scientists, in this century they are to exceed even these 2 degrees.
2595	19	UNICEF reports that as a result of drought about 15o thousand children left school to help in collecting water and other daily duties. A representative of the UNICEF in Ethiopia during the UN briefing which took place in Geneva, through video conference announced that a violent part of water sources dried and emphasized the need to renovate the wells, drilling new and supplying water to healthcare centers.
2595	21	None of the places in the world showed as emphatically as tragic in the consequences it could be ignoring the climate disaster. For now, the price for a galloping and irrelevant capitalism has paid the least guilty Africa, but it is only a matter of time until the same problems that the Africans are currently struggling to come north.
2598	1	Colonialism is still ongoing. And is one of the causes of climate change
2598	3	In the third part of the sixth report of the intergovernmental climate change team (IPCC), scientists for the first time indicated colonialism as the historical and current cause of the climate crisis, i.e. the greatest global threat to humanity.
2598	5	Colonialism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, but it can be perceived as conquering areas and countries, which is accompanied by three types of violence: cultural violence through negation of native culture, economic violence through the exploitation of population and political violence through pressure and receiving self -destruction of residents.
2598	7	The influence of colonialism on nature is bright and you can see it through huge mines, polluted rivers and depleted lands. On all continents, the colonizers cut out mangrove forests, meadows, tropical forests and wetlands to make space for quarries, plantations, ranks, roads and railways.
2598	9	The fact that the IPCC report has one specific word may not seem to be something great, but it is quite the opposite. Together with each report, IPCC publishes a summary for decision -makers. This summary is a meticulously analyzed and discussed line by the ruler - not only by the best scientists in the world, but also by officials representing 195 rule, which affect the final sound of the summary and often formulate comments as to individual words or phrases.
2598	11	The fact that "colonialism" was in the summary means that officials and scientists from around the world see a significant role that this phenomenon played in the "heating" of our planet and the destruction of its nature. The Atmos magazine noticed that the role of colonialism in causing a climate crisis has been part of the narrative of the movement for climate justice for decades. For example, during last year's COP26 Brazilian activist for the indigenous people of Taily, the area opened the Pavilion of Native Peoples, saying that "colonialism caused climate change" and the solution is "giving the rights of indigenous people".
2598	13	How did "colonialism" appear in the IPCC report? First of all, it was not without influence that this time more women and people with a non -white skin color worked on the report, and therefore social groups particularly affected by this phenomenon. Secondly, as the atmosphere indicates, within eight years that have passed since the last IPCC report, there was an explosion of literature indicating the relationship between climate change and colonialism. IPCC reports, however, compile the conclusions of thousands of existing works. The authors put them together and present a full picture of scientific consensus.
2598	15	One study indicating the relationship between colonialism and climate change was published in the magazine "PNAS" in 2020. A pair of archaeologists analyzed the atmosphere on the Caribbean Islands and in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean. Researchers discovered how the changes were intensified by the history of colonization and injustice. The Caribbean struggles with more and more intense hurricanes driven by warming oceans. It is also expected that these threats will increase along with climate change caused by human activity.
2598	17	At the same time, scientists have found that colonization forced the inhabitants of the islands to move away from methods of building resistant houses. Archaeological excavations conducted in the Caribbean revealed the history of the creation of round buildings with deeply embedded columns made of strong local wood and lightweight roofed roofs. However, after the colonization of the islands, European architecture displaced the traditional one. Today's houses are made of reinforced concrete, not from locally available materials, and are easily destroyed during hurricanes. This reduces the chance of survival of buildings and its reconstruction after intense tropical storms.
2598	19	Similarly, forests and other natural resources Madagascar were destroyed by Europeans who wanted to get more profits from the colonies there. Today, the descendants of the indigenous population inhabited the poorer areas, which show the effects of soil degradation, erosion and degradation, which means that these lands are even more exposed to climate change.
2598	21	However, the relationship between colonialism and climate change is not only a relic of the past. Currently, the concept of compensation for carbon dioxide emissions is also analyzed as a new form of this phenomenon. This is because it allows the developed countries to use developing ladies by using their low carbon dioxide emissions to compensate for their increasing carbon dioxide emissions.
2598	23	Many companies have undertaken to achieve climate neutrality. To achieve this goal, more and more of them are reaching for coal loans. According to the strategic consulting company, the market of voluntary coal loans can reach up to $ 50 billion by 2030. The term "compensation for carbon dioxide emissions" refers to carbon dioxide, whose emission is reduced, which will be avoided or which is captured from the atmosphere to compensate for emissions generated elsewhere.
2598	25	Most of the carbon dioxide compensation projects are to be forested again. Limiting carbon dioxide emissions by planting more trees in developing countries may seem a good idea. However, through initiatives aimed at slowing down the pace of climate change, richer countries dominate the less poorer and their inhabitants, which creates a new form of neocolonalism - climate colonialism. Rich countries invest in the countries of the Global South and dictate how to keep the land and forests to people who have lived there for thousands of years. When the new norm that people who have power want to adopt the native population, interfere with how native groups usually handle their own land, this can potentially lead to displacement and even violence.
2598	27	In 2014, the Oakland Institute revealed that the Kenyan Forest Service, financed by the World Bank, beat, threatened and even arrested members of the Sengwer community to obtain land for forestry cultivation for CO2 compensation. At the United Nations meeting in 2016, a native leader from the Turtle Island accused countries developed of privatization and sale of holy forests and lands, which are their property. Coal offset designs are harmful to the population, also changing the economic system on which its survival is based.
2598	29	Most of the carbon dioxide compensation projects are located in the countries of the global south, and most are bought by the countries of the global north. So instead of attracting governments and change existing production and consumption patterns, entities in developed countries use coal offset as a form of indulgence. They force the countries of the Global South to change their economies so that these Global North countries can continue to emit CO2.
2598	31	So how do you reduce the phenomenon of climate colonialism? First of all, by ensuring co -depression to the indigenous people in climate investments regarding their lands and the transformation of the landscape, as well as simply by returning their lands. It is also important to finance long -term earth management programs by native inhabitants and to provide indigenous inhabitants of autonomy in making decisions about expenses, as well as the use of ecological knowledge of local communities.
2599	1	Korwin-Mikke: "Ice grows in Antarctica." Not to defend the thesis
2599	3	The confederation MP Janusz Korwin-Mikke convinced on August 6 on Polish Radio 24 that what is said about the need to close coal power plants or to promote more ecological energy sources is "nonsense" and humanity "crazy". - These environmentalists also went crazy - the confederation politician was indignant. Korwin-Mikke talked about the natural cycle of carbon circulation in the environment and argued that this element "was in the air, somehow the earth survived". - Also when he returns to the air again, what will happen? Warming will take place and very well. They threaten to increase the temperature by two degrees, and great. It will be in Poland like in Czech Prague, so there will be nothing terrible - he performed.
2599	5	Korwin -Mikke continued to talk about "the previous global warming", which - as he claimed - happened around the 11th century, when Greenland was a "green land, as the name suggests". He also talked about the "peak of global cold" and about "local, global cold" around 1600. "You can't see that the water level was lifted somehow," Korwin -Mikke continued. He added that he read 30 years ago that in 20 years Maldives would be under water. - Meanwhile, real estate prices in the Maldives go up - he said.
2599	7	"Environmentalists don't say one thing ..."
2599	9	The most important fragment of Janusz Korwin-Mikke's argument was the thesis about Antarctica, on which ice covers are allegedly arriving. The politician explained that the reason for the growth of ice was to move to this continent of water vapor. - Environmentalists do not say one thing: indeed, ice turns into water, it's true, but the water turns into a steam - he explained. - For example, in Florida, everyone can see that it is sultry, right? Then a couple arises, this couple, incidentally, condenses in the province of the Catherine in Brazil. In Brazil, they have been snowy for 200 years and this is a lot, and then this pair is flying over Antarctica and, to the amazement of ecologists, the ice grows in Antarctica. This is the couple over Greenland, melts, evaporates and wanders south - said Korwin -Mikke.
2599	11	The recording with the statement of Janusz Korwin-Mikke showed dr. Jakub Małecki, who is a glaciologist-hydrologist dealing with the examination of glaciers. He is associated with the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. The expert decided that it could not be defended that the ice in Antarctica is increasing. It is less and less, and this is happening as a result of human activity in the last over a hundred years.
2599	13	Prague in Warsaw? "The ricochet will hit a man"
2599	15	Doctor Jakub Małecki explains that climate change has been repeatedly in the history of Earth, which was influenced by the sun's activity, the orbital cycles of the Earth and changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases. - Especially the last changes are interested in us today, because we are just experiencing them at a very fast pace - says Dr. Małecki. When approx. 12 thousand years ago, the last glaciation ended, for raising the average global temperature by 1 degree Celsius, nature needed about 1500 years. - We and our CO2 emissions did it ten times faster - he notes.
2599	17	He further explains that nature emits as many greenhouse gases as it can absorb. Now it is impossible - the total emission of CO2 of nature and people is slightly greater than complete absorption. The CO2 surplus accumulates with each year, and the disproportion between natural and actual concentration increases.
2599	19	Will Janusz Korwin -Mikke claims - in Poland it will do like in Prague and "nothing so terrible will be"? Doctor Małecki replies that in the case of Polish global warming by 2 degrees can mean a 3-speed or even greater temperature increase. - Such insulation means huge and adverse changes for nature, including plants, fauna and hydrology of the country. This is not cool, because a ricochet will always get a man then - he says. He notes that the increase in temperature by one degree of Celsius in the last just over 100 years is the average value for the whole globe, including the mostly oceans covering it. And the land heats up faster than the oceans.
2599	21	Ice in Antarctica is decreasing through underwater melting, not warm air
2599	23	Dr. Jakub Małecki says that larger warming is clearly visible in the polar regions - some have already warmed up to a few degrees Celsius. In the northern pole of the Arctic located around the Northern Pole, floating in the sea disappears, mountain glaciers disappear, Greenland ice sheet melts faster.
2599	25	Contrary to what Janusz Korwin -Mikke suggests, the name Greenland (literally - green land) explorer of the island and Banita Eryk Rudy wanted to encourage settlers from Iceland to colonize it. - In the times after the birth of Christ it was never green, i.e. with a clearly lower range of ice than today - notes Dr. Małecki. Around the 11th century there was no global warming, and in 1650 there was no global cold. Temperature changes were recorded at most locally or regionally. - Studies show that the global climate has been extremely slow, but systematically from about 5000 before our era, until the nineteenth century, when human activity seriously entered the atmospheric game - says Dr. Małecki.
2599	27	As he explains, the ice situation around the South Pole is more complex than in the north. It is necessary to clearly separate sea ice (Król) floating in the southern ocean and land ice on the continent of Antarctica. Nowadays, the Kra runs a slightly larger area than in the 1980s. Stronger winds push it further from the coast. - The ice sheet generally loses the mass systematically and the pace is growing total - emphasizes Dr. Małecki.
2599	29	The ice sheet is divided into two main parts: a larger eastern and smaller west. - The eastern part is pretty good: most of the studies for the last two or three decades state either a fairly stable mass, even with periods of growth, or only relatively small losses - explains the expert. - It is worse with the western part that loses the mass quickly - he adds.
2599	31	This happens to a lesser extent due to the more intensive melting of the surface, and above all by underwater melting and losing the iceberg to the ocean. For Antarctica, the biggest threat is therefore not warmer air, but the growing temperature of the water surrounding it. - So you can't defend the statement that the ice in Antarctica is coming. She loses him total, even though the temperature never increases above zero inside the continent - sums up Dr. Jakub Małecki.
2599	33	Increased water evaporation? Glaciers lose weight anyway
2599	35	In the analysis for Zasta24, Dr. Małecki emphasizes that he is not known to any scientific sources, which in the 90s would alert before sinking the Maldives around 2010. - This risk is real for the year 2100, because it is the most flat and the lowest country of the world - assesses Dr. Małecki. He adds that these islands may become unfit for living due to the potentially much larger range of storm waves or flooding than before.
2599	37	Mountain glaciers around the world and Greenland and Antarctica, melting, add their melting water from the land to the ocean and raise its level. - Ice is the greatest shareholder of this process, behind it is the thermal expansion of heating oceans - explains Dr. Jakub Małecki. The current pace of this height is 3-4 cm per decade. Too small to watch them with the naked eye, but detectable for instruments and satellites. - If the CO2 emission rate continues to grow, until the end of the 21st century, the level of the sea can increase by an average of some meter relative to pre -industrial times - the expert assesses.
2599	39	He emphasizes that increased evaporation from the oceans is not able to remove surplus water in the oceans, because after a short time of evaporation, the water goes to the ocean back as rain or river water. - Increased evaporation may, however, result in greater rainfall and such a trend is actually observed in some regions of the world - admits Dr. Małecki and adds that this also happens in some of the resulting zones, which results in greater snow supply. - Unfortunately, these increases are usually too small to compensate for negative changes caused by a higher temperature and despite the snower winters, these glaciers lose weight anyway - he says. - In the Eastern Antarctica, in turn, this mechanism probably contributes to the relative stability of this part of the ice sheet - he adds.
2599	41	The expert, however, denies that greater snowfall in Antarctica is associated with evaporation in Florida and the transport of steam by Brazil, where snowfall recently occurred in the south. - First of all, the transmission of couples between the northern and southern hemisphere is difficult by the equatorial winds. Secondly, the last snowfall in southern Brazil did not go there from the north, but from Antarctica, i.e. from the south - says Dr. Małecki. And it reminds that snowfall in Brazil happens more than once every 200 years.
