You insult us, ambassador: Woody Johnson flagrantly abused special relationship, says PETER OBORNE

With three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through Parliament.
Next week, MPs will reassemble at Westminster — and the following week, they will vote on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.
If they vote it down, Britain will be plunged into the greatest constitutional crisis in more than 100 years.
Mrs May might even resign and a new prime minister take over.
The stakes could not be higher.
U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit
Into this national crisis of epic proportions has just waded the clodhopping U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson.
On Monday, Mr Johnson foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May’s premiership.
He informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit.
Lethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain’s closest ally and strategic partner — with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II.
This brutal attack by Donald Trump’s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her — and Britain’s — future.
All the more so since he held out the carrot of a ‘quick, very massive bilateral trade deal’ .

Notorious
Furthermore, Mr Johnson’s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James’s.
The first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics.
Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest.
By implication, Mr Johnson has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘losers’ whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account.
There is no defence of Mr Johnson’s conduct.
And no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement.
Mr Johnson, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy.
This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party.
Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush’s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run.
The switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism.
But then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as Johnson to important ambassadorial jobs.
Take Lana Marks, the President’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities.
In common with an embarrassing number of Trump’s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump’s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members’ resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website.
Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump’s presidential campaign.
Everything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump.
And, in December, Trump’s administration put forward as America’s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy.
Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals
Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers.
In truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions.
Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. ambassador to London.
Woody Johnson cannot be classed in their company.
This scion of the industrial company Johnson & Johnson — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division.
Outcry
Twelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm’s involvement in tax avoidance schemes.
Johnson said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful.
However, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest.
In Britain, such a record could have debarred Johnson from further involvement in public life.
And the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry.
But then, it’s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody Johnson did with Mrs May on New Year’s Eve.
Of course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House.
Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President
He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump’s America.
Or on the progress of Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President.
Squirming
He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President.
Above all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
I should point out that Mr Johnson did say that Britain’s future was ‘extremely positive, extremely bright’.
But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister.
Professional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP.
I can’t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody Johnson.
So when Trump’s crony Johnson turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage.
The fact is that Johnson is out of his depth.
Like his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S.
If the President won’t rein him in — and I’m not holding my breath — Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act.
And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.
