Blackmail, Balderdash, and the Brexit

After a lot of drama, British Prime Minister Theresa May came back from Brussels with a breakthrough on Brexit.
Only it wasn’t.
While the changes to the protocol that governs the implementation of the Irish Backstop are an improvement they are far fro enough to allay the rightful fears of Brexiteers and the Northern Irish.
From the beginning of this process, the EU has been in blackmail mode.
They’ve made it clear that they would not negotiate in good faith or even at all.
That much has been clear.
The biggest question has been whether May herself was working in the British people’s best interest or was she simply a stalking horse for further EU integration of the entire continent of Europe.
Never forget that the EU has imperial ambitions.
Those that have been its architects saw it as regaining the mantle of the center of the world as the U.S. bankrupts itself maintaining an empire around the world, fighting against the rise of Russia and China.
It sits in the weeds, making byzantine bureaucratic law and building both a fiscal and political union through these under-handed back doors.

And the people of Europe have woken up to it.
The Brits voted to leave the EU because of this.
Euroskeptic parties are rising across Europe.
The latest rebuke of the EU came in Austria’s Salzburg, a traditional center-left stronghold just voted for a Lega-style nationalist/populist majority.
Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.
This point cannot be understated.
Because it is the model for how the EU will fight the rising opposition to its rule.
The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.
It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.
It was designed to cause irreparable damage to the U.K. with the long-term effects of destroying the majority political parties and fanning separatist instincts in Wales and Scotland.
And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no-deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.
Poll after poll shows overwhelming rejection of May’s Merkel’s deal as well as growing support for a No-Deal Brexit.
And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.
Businesses are relocating, shipments are stopping, etc.
All because of Brexit, they argue.
No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.
Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.
Theresa May’s performance in parliament before the latest vote was almost convincing.
But, as always, when someone is giving you an ultimatum, my way or the highway, it’s masking an alternative choice.
The Dublin Unionist Party and the European Research Group within the Tories understand this.

And the reason for this is May was always on their side.
It’s not a negotiation when there’s only one side represented.
This is why Juncker et.al.
refused to negotiate in any meaningful way.
They didn’t have to.

And that is simply blackmail.
What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.
Because any organization that would blackmail rather than negotiate is not an organization anyone decent person would want to be a member of.
Fears over a No-Deal Brexit are overblown.
If these same MP’s that are so worried about the uncertainty created by the Brexit process would simply end that uncertainty by backing No-Deal then certainty would return.
It might not be the certainty that is the easiest to swallow for both sides but it will be certainty.
Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.
That’s an insult and it should be treated as such by Parliament.
But it won’t be as MP’s roll over, show Juncker their bellies and hand-wring about how unfair it all is again later this week.
They cannot see the bigger picture that it is the EU that has the weak hand, not them.
They are too blinded by ideology and fear to see that.
