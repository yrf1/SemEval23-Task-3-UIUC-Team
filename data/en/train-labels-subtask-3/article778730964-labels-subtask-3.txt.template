778730964	3	It’s noteworthy that AP would carry this story at all; certainly, neither AP nor the rest of the establishment media is ever so solicitous of those whom they smear as “anti-Muslim” to allow us to tell our side of the story. But the imam Siraj Wahhaj is here engaging in some “war is deceit” action. His son was on the radar of counterterror officials for 13 years on suspicion of jihad activity.

Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, a spokesman for the mosque, said in a video posted Thursday on Facebook that the incident was a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism.
