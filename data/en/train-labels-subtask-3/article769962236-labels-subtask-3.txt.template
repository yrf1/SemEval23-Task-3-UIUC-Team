769962236	12	Here‚Äôs what happened:
769962236	13	Is this the America Maxine Waters wanted? Where Trump supporters can't even have a meal in peace? https://t.co/9g1BSiw8LS ‚Äî The Columbia Bugle üá∫üá∏ (@ColumbiaBugle) July 5, 2018
769962236	14	The attack took place in a Whataburger restaurant, and the corporation was quick to condemn the man‚Äôs actions:
769962236	15	‚ÄúWe were shocked to see this video and certainly don‚Äôt condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants. To be clear, no Whataburger employees were involved or witnessed the incident, and we ask that questions be directed to San Antonio PD as we continue supporting their efforts.‚Äù
769962236	16	Jimenez, who is 30, seems to have only had a part-time job. His employer was a San Antonio nightspot called Rumble. Immediately upon learning of the altercation, the bar announced that it had fired Jimenez because they believed such behavior was immoral, uncalled for, and not in keeping with Rumble‚Äôs welcoming personality.
769962236	17	On their Facebook page, they wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶We have since terminated this employee, as his actions go against everything that this establishment stands for. Rumble has, and always will be, a bar that is as inclusive as any establishment could possibly be. THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE! No matter your race, creed, ethnicity, sexual identity, and political stance, you are welcomed here!‚Äù Rumble said on Facebook that Jimenez worked as a ‚Äúpart-time door guy.‚Äù They added, ‚ÄúWe do not condone these types of actions or behavior. If you have any questions or concerns please message us privately. We support and appreciate your business.‚Äù
769962236	18	Contrary to what you might believe about Jimenez‚Ä¶ he is/was NOT a Democrat!
769962236	19	No, he is further to the Left and was an active member of the Green Party. However, upon learning of his behavior the local Green Party told the media that Jimenez had been cut off from the party for his uncalled for attack on a child.
769962236	20	‚ÄúWe all have different opinions of our president, but we don‚Äôt take it out on innocent kids who just happen to have a hat on,‚Äù Gavino Zarate, secretary of the Harris County Green Party told Heavy. ‚ÄúYou may not like the hat or you may not like the president, but you don‚Äôt show that kind of aggression toward teenagers. It goes against everything the Green Party stands for. We are not violent. We do not take our aggression out on innocent young people.‚Äù
769962236	21	Some on the right have connected the attack to Maxine Waters‚Äô call for Democrats to confront members of the Trump administration whenever, and wherever they happened to find them. Leftists have said the connection is unfair, because Waters‚Äô was only calling for accosting Trump administration officials. My question is; how big of a leap would it be for a normal, rational adult to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them to power? Not much in my mind.
769962236	22	The reality is that the Democrats are as much to blame for the corrosive and ugly rhetoric in America today as Donald Trump is.
