697996062	1	Two DREAMERs Caught Smuggling Illegal Aliens
697996062	3	Or rather, "Two illegal aliens caught smuggling less glamorous illegal aliens."
697996062	4	The distinction between the illegal aliens who benefited from Obama's illegal amnesty and other illegals has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance. And illegal aliens are not a racial or ethnic group. They're an industry: an economic industry and a political industry. If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals. Meanwhile DREAMERs continue violating the law. In more ways than one.
697996062	5	Customs and Border Protection said the first smuggling attempt was broken up on Oct. 4, after Border Patrol agents stopped a car at a checkpoint on Interstate 35 and discovered two illegal immigrants from Brazil hiding in the trunk.
697996062	6	The driver of the car was from Guatemala, a juvenile who had been approved by the Obama administration for a DACA permit in 2016.
697996062	7	Three days later the same checkpoint snared another DACA recipient from Mexico smuggling an illegal immigrant from Mexico in his trunk.
697996062	8	Neither of the Dreamersâ€™ names were released.
697996062	9	They and the illegal immigrants they were trying to smuggle are all being processed for deportation, CBP said.
