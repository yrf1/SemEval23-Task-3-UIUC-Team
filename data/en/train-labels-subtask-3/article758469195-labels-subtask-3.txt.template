758469195	4	US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a brain injury sustained by an American official in a "sonic attack" in China was similar to those that affected US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba.
758469195	5	Pompeo's remarks on Wednesday came hours after the US embassy in China issued a health warning to Americans living there over an "unusual" auditory or sensory phenomena.
758469195	6	The embassy said a US government employee in the southern city of Guangzhou reported experiencing a "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure", which led to a mild brain injury.
758469195	7	Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the "sonic attack" in China was similar to the incidents in Cuba last year.
758469195	8	"The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba," he said.
758469195	9	The US was moving medical teams to the area to work on the case, he said.
758469195	10	"We are working to figure out what took place both in Havana and now in China as well," Pompeo said.
758469195	11	China's foreign ministry did not comment immediately.
758469195	12	Heather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman, said the US embassy learned on Friday that the Guangzhou employee showed concussion symptoms after medical testing.
758469195	13	That is the same clinical finding doctors treating the Cuba patients at the University of Philadelphia found.
758469195	14	The Guangzhou worker started experiencing "a variety of symptoms" starting in late 2017 that lasted through April this year, Nauert said.
758469195	15	The worker was sent to the US for further evaluation, she added.
758469195	16	In Cuba last year, 24 diplomats and their family members were left with mysterious injuries resembling brain trauma, which were suspected of being caused by a "sonic attack".
758469195	17	Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered similar illnesses.
758469195	18	The still-unexplained incidents sparked a rift in US-Cuban relations, while investigators have chased theories including a sonic attack, an electromagnetic weapon, or a flawed spying device.
758469195	19	Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person, according to The Associated Press.
758469195	20	Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some struggle with concentration or common word recall.
