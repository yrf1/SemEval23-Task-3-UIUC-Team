371	1	The "green" load falls on the weakest
371	3	Rural regions, which combine agricultural production with the tourist attraction of their mountains and places, their fauna and its flora, and to which the future is threatened to seize the future based on an "electric monoculture," scarce, even in positions of work
371	5	On Teruel and other regions of the Bajo Aragon, archetypes of the most empty Spain, the threat of a landscape buried under the shadows of wind turbines and huge parks of photovoltaic plates, whose fruit, the "green" energy, has distant consumers, has distant consumers, has distant consumers, has distant consumers, In the industrialized and well populated areas of Valencia and Catalonia, also, of Aragon himself, called to continue thriving, while the energy burden falls on his weakest neighbors.
371	7	Thus, what the Aragonese president, Javier Lambán, considers a great success - called by the hand of a "friend" company, Florestalia, to which his government has favored with autonomic ad hoc decrees since 2016 -, the Turolenses suffer as they suffer as A direct attack on its way of life, strongly incardinated in one of the most beautiful places in Spain, and seed of future population displacements.
371	9	And it will not be because the province does not contribute to the unstoppable process of replacing conventional energies with renewables. As La Razón published today, in Teruel there are currently 22 wind farms, compared to 12 in Catalonia, and a total of 336 wind and photovoltaic parks are processed, with a total power of 19,000 megawatts, that is, twenty times more than more than The consumption of the entire province. With an added problem, which is underway the authorization of a very high voltage line, projected by Florestalia to serve the Valencian Community, which, if approved, would serve as a magnet for the installation of more wind and solar macroparks.
371	11	Of course, it is not about rejecting the development of renewable energies, more in a country such as Spain that lacks solid fuel sources, but also recognizing that green energy also has environmental impacts, not only landscape Account by those responsible for Spanish energy design. Because, otherwise, the load will end up falling, as is the case, on the most unpopulated regions, with municipalities in chronic deficit and without political pressure, precisely, because the number of their voters makes them expendable in the electoral offer.
371	13	Rural regions, which combine agricultural production with the tourist attraction of their mountains and places, their fauna and its flora, and to which the future is threatened to seize the future based on an "electric monoculture," scarce, even in positions of work. As the neighbors of Teruel demand, it is up to the central government to prepare a territory management plan for the purposes of energy production, which guarantees the greatest environmental conservation and quality of life in the rural world. Or, otherwise expressed, due solidarity among all Spaniards, live in villages or in large cities.
3710	1	Poland 'seals its border' and lifts a barrier with the Russian enclave of Kalinningrad
3710	3	Poland "seals its border" and lifts a barrier with the Russian enclave of Kalinningrad
3710	5	Since September 19, Poland has not granted entry permits to Russian citizens, with the exception of humanitarian cases, political dissidents, diplomats or travelers in transit
3710	7	The Polish Minister of Defense, Mariusz Blaszczak, announced on Wednesday the "immediate" construction of a provisional barrier along the border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and the beginning of the works to raise a permanent wall.
3710	9	Blaszczak explained on Wednesday at a press conference in Warsaw that the barrier that will begin to build today will consist of a triple row of fence "such as those used by armies around the world" and that will run along the 210 kilometers of the terrestrial border perimeter of the Russian province of Kaliningrad.
3710	11	According to the minister, the decision to "seal the border" between Poland and Russia as soon as possible during the Council of Ministers last Friday.
3710	13	In addition, Blaszczak said that today the body of Saplators from the Polish army will begin its telemetry work for the construction of a permanent border wall on that border "of the same type as the one that already exists on the border between Poland and Belarus", which has about 2.5 meters high and 3 wide and is equipped with electronic surveillance measures. The wall is expected to be finished at the end of 2023.
3710	15	Recently, the Polish authorities expressed their fear that Moscupueda triggers a migration crisis against Poland from Kalinningrad similar to that which was lived until a few months ago with Belarus as the protagonist.
3710	17	Since the end of 2021, thousands of migrants from Asia and Africa concentrated on the Polish-Bielorruse border with the intention of illegally entering the European Union (EU), which caused a strong diplomatic tension between Minsk and Warsaw.
3710	19	Poland accuses Aleksander Lukashenko's regime of having attracted thousands of people from countries such as Iraq or Syria and having instigated them to cross to Polish territory to destabilize and cause Poland.
3710	21	Krzysztof Sobolewski, spokesman for the Polish government party, declared a few days ago that "Moscow could plan a similar operation" from Kaliningrad and assured that the airport of that city has begun to recently receive flights from the Middle East and Asia.
3710	23	Since September 19, Poland has not granted entry permits to its territory to Russian citizens, with the exception of humanitarian cases, political dissidents, diplomats or travelers in transit.
3710	25	In addition, since last week Russian nationals are denied to obtain work permits in Poland and those who currently have it will not be able to renew them.
3710	27	The Polish Minister of Defense, Mariusz Blaszczak, announced on Wednesday the "immediate" construction of a provisional barrier along the border with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and the beginning of the works to raise a permanent wall.
3711	1	Lukashenko raises the bet in his 'blackmail' to the EU with a new wave of migrants
3711	3	The migration crisis on the border between Belarus and the European Union causes new tensions. Poland and other countries ask for European financing to build fences or walls
3711	5	They travel in airplanes from Istanbul or Lebanon. They arrive at Minsk and, from there, are taken to the border of the European Union, in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This is what the heads of state and government of the twenty -seven have already described as a "hybrid attack" by the Alexander Lukashenko regime, in response to the sanctions that the union imposed on Belarus for the repression of the democratic opposition After electoral fraud orchestrated by the regime in August 2020. The objective, the community block points out, is to destabilize the European Union.
3711	7	The crisis has been a tide that has been climbing during the last weeks. Migrants began to arrive in summer at the borders of the Union, especially the Polish. But in recent weeks the number of illegal entries in the European territory has increased dramatically. Many migrants spend days in forests that separate Belarus from Poland waiting for their moment to follow their trip to their true objective: Germany.
3711	9	"What we are seeing on the border is an attempt by Lukashenko to destabilize the European Union and its member states," explained a spokesman for the European Commission. Another spokesman recalled that, in any case, migrants must be treated "human and dignified based on European values." Minsk's objective is that the European Union lift the foot of the accelerator in the sanctions imposed on the regime and that the economic situation of the country worsens. Given this intention, from the European Commission remember that the Lukashenko government maintains repression against Belarusians themselves and any type of opposition.
3711	11	Lithuania and Latvia, who are also suffering from this migratory pressure, have closed ranks with Poland and show their support for Warsaw. Artis Pabriks, Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, said Monday that "there is an ongoing escalation of the Belarusian hybrid attack against the Polish border." "We demand that the EU and the nations of the EU support Poland in these difficult hours," he said through social networks.
3711	13	The images of hundreds of migrants arriving at the border with Poland on Monday have triggered concern in Brussels. The 2015 and 2016 immigration crisis, during which millions of migrants and refugees entered European territory and especially Germany, left deep scars in the European Union, caused a true 'shock' in many member states - even in those who did not They were affected by it - and has become the axis of rotation of the national political debate in many capitals.
3711	15	The entire neighborhood of the European Union knows well that migration is the Achilles heel of the Community Club. Belarus only does what Turkey already did in early 2020 when he threatened the union with a new immigration crisis with the aim of starting assignments from the community club. The fact that the twenty -seven do not have a common asylum policy especially complicates the management of migratory flows and exposes to union even more to use than third countries such as Turkey or Belarus make migrants and asylum applicants.
3711	17	Frontex as a solution?
3711	19	"The best way to manage joint borders is with joint resources, and Frontex and Europol are ready to attend," said the spokesman for the Community Executive, who recalled that they are already attending the Lithuanian and Lathy authorities, but not the Polish Because the government has not asked. "Poland has to ask for that presence and we have encouraged them to do it repeatedly," said the spokesman.
3711	21	What the Polish government asks is that the construction of physical barriers on the border can be financed with European funds. Warsaw has already approved the construction of a wall worth 350 million euros. But the Polish government is not at all only in this request. Austria, Bulgaria, Chipre, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia joined Warsaw at the beginning of October in a letter sent to Margaritis Schinas, vice president of the European Commission, demanding that “this Legitimate measure [the construction of a fence or wall] should be financed additional and properly charged to the EU budget as a priority issue. ” Some voices within the Brussels bubble, such as Manfred Weber, leader of the European Popular Party (PPE) in the Eurocamara, have joined this request.
3711	23	This group of countries took the proposal to the last meeting of heads of state and government. But for now he continues to receive a sound not from the European Commission and other capitals. "I made it very clear that there is an opinion well established in the European Commission and in the European Parliament that there will be no [European] financing for thorn and wall wires," said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the Community Executive, after the meeting. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was also very forceful: "I would be ashamed to see a fence with a sign 'financed by the EU."
3711	25	They travel in airplanes from Istanbul or Lebanon. They arrive at Minsk and, from there, are taken to the border of the European Union, in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This is what the heads of state and government of the twenty -seven have already described as a "hybrid attack" by the Alexander Lukashenko regime, in response to the sanctions that the union imposed on Belarus for the repression of the democratic opposition After electoral fraud orchestrated by the regime in August 2020. The objective, the community block points out, is to destabilize the European Union.
3712	1	Moscow displays troops in Belarus after the increase in tensions on the Ukrainian border
3712	3	The decision was taken, according to Minsk's version, given the increase in NATO's potential next to its borders, especially by the Poland Rearme and Baltic countries
3712	5	The Ministry of Defense of Belarus today announced the arrival of the first group of Russian military who will form a military group along with Belarus forces in the face of the increase in tensions with neighboring Ukraine. "The first trains with the Russian military who will integrate the Regional Military Group arrived in the Republic of Belarus," said Belarusian command in his Telegram channel.
3712	7	"The military were received with joy, bread and salt," according to the traditions of Russian and Belarusian hospitality, the Ministry of Defense said in their message, in which he published a video of the arrival. Víctor Tumar, representative of the General Staff of the Belarusian Army, announced on the eve the next arrival of the Russian military, a decision made by both countries before the increase in the potential of NATO at the borders with Belarus, the rearme of Poland and the Baltic countries .
3712	9	"The Regional Military Group of the State Union is a strictly defensive project," said Tumar. Last week, Lukashenko announced having agreed to create said group with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
3712	11	"In view of the aggravation of the situation at the western borders of the State Union we agree to deploy a regional group (military) of both countries, he said. Then, NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg asked Minsk to stop supporting Russia's "special military operation." Ukraine accuses Belarus of complicity in the current Russian military campaign by giving its territory to the invading army to launch attacks in the neighboring country.
3712	13	The Ministry of Defense of Belarus today announced the arrival of the first group of Russian military who will form a military group along with Belarus forces in the face of the increase in tensions with neighboring Ukraine. "The first trains with the Russian military who will integrate the Regional Military Group arrived in the Republic of Belarus," said Belarusian command in his Telegram channel.
3713	1	Russia calls 120,000 young people in military service promising that they will not be destined for war in Ukraine
3713	3	Russia began on Tuesday the autumn enlistment phase for mandatory military service and assured that recruits will not be sent to the "special military operation" in Ukraine.
3713	5	In total, 120,000 Russian citizens, 7,500 less than in the same period last year, and the process of its incorporation to the Armed Forces will extend until December 31.
3713	7	"The military who comply with the mandatory military service fulfills tasks according to the type of unit to which they are assigned, but will not be sent to the area of ​​the special military operation," said Russia Defense Minister Serguéi Shoigú, in A meeting with the Russian high command. At the same time, he stressed that those who have already fulfilled their year of mandatory military service will return this fall to their homes.
3713	9	The Russian military command has assured that recruits will not be sent to the territory of the popular republics of Donetsk and Lugansk and the regions of Zaporiyia and Jersón, recently annexed by Moscow.
3713	11	However, the American Institute of War Study (ISW) has warned that recruits "almost certainly will be deployed in Ukraine around March or April 2023", once they conclude their period training. According to the ISW, the sending of recruits could occur even before, depending on the situation on the battlefield.
3713	13	The autumnal call to ranks in Russia usually begins on October 1, but this year was postponed a month due to the partial mobilization decreed on September 21 by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to deal with military setbacks in Ukraine.
3713	15	Last Friday Shoigú resulted in the order of the head of the State and announced that the plan to mobilize 300,000 reservists, of which 87,000, as they affirmed today, were already sent to the area of ​​the military campaign in Ukraine.
3713	17	The call for rows for mandatory military service is carried out throughout the Russian Federation, except in 25 municipalities of five federated entities located at the east of the country due to its geographical situation and climatic conditions.
3713	19	"The majority of recruits will be sent to instruction units, where within up to five months they will learn to use modern armament and form in military specialties," said Contramirante Vladimir Tsimlianski, of the Department of Mobilization of the General Staff. According to Tsimlianski, the more than 25,000 enlistment commissions has all the elements to equip recruits.
3713	21	During the partial mobilization for the campaign in Ukraine the complaints of reservists about the lack of the most elementary equipment were multiplied and that they were forced to buy it with their own money.
3713	23	The Russian law establishes that all Russian citizens between 18 and 27 are obliged to fulfill military service, which lasts one year. The evasion of mandatory military service is punished in Russia with up to 2 years in prison.
3713	25	Between May 1 and September 20 of this year, 410 criminal proceedings were initiated against evaders of the Compulsory Military Service, according to the RBC informative portal, which stressed that it is the largest number of cases of the last ten years in the same period
3714	1	Trans violence, leftist violence
3714	3	The totalitarian are comfortably installed here, in the West, among us.
3714	5	When an idea or ideology have to impose themselves through violence - this is the type of type - that gives us two fundamental clues about them: that they are wrong and that are very bad.
3714	7	This has been in history and especially in the history of the last two centuries, when the promise of paradise ceased to be religious, it became 'scientific' and, with that new legitimacy, it was allowed to be much more brutal than the Religion had been in his worst moments, already practically forgotten.
3714	9	It is true that modernity has almost completely freed us from that brutality - at least in the West, that phrase cannot be written in the China of XI, the Russia of Putin or the Iran of the Ayatolas - but instead the totalitarian temptation continues to enjoy Good health very unfortunate and not only in the despicable regimes of the second and the third world, no: the totalitarian are comfortably installed here, in the West, among us.
3714	11	Of course, all that violence - an agreement, not all, I will accept that only 99% - it comes from the left, but you have to understand it: it is its custom more or less since someone thought it was a shame to waste the guillotines leaving them leaving them leaving them Just like a gadget to cut pure. A story that is not ashamed at all: remember that "our cuts will be with guillotine"; They are like this: they can neither avoid it nor do they really want.
3714	13	Moreover, if they are virtuous in something it is when finding new reasons for pressure, cancellation, threat, for violence in short. The last of the long list is the trans, by calling it in some way, the imposition of blood and fire of an ideology so radical that it does not even admit the discussion, which does not tolerate intellectual confrontation.
3714	15	I will not go into the irreversible damage they are doing to hundreds or thousands of confused teenagers who have no problem ruining life, because they have not come here to worry about anyone's lives; I will not comment on what the practical erase of their reality, their difference and in many areas their rights can assume for so many women.
3714	17	No, let's focus only on what we could call collateral damage, what they are already doing to impose what could not be admitted otherwise: the cancellation to those who dare to explain reality, pressures to professionals, threats threats In which, again, they are proud of the most violent and despicable past on the left: "You have a gift under the car", they tell professors of the Complutense University, here, in Madrid, not in an impoverished society and Violent, at least for now.
3714	19	Even the Inquisition claimed the very desebrined ones, it is not that they do not have the slightest modesty: they look at their totalitarianism with incredible self -confidence.
3714	21	I know that what is good today is to applycene yourself by the progress of the extreme right, insult Vox and be all as very computed because Meloni has won the elections in Italy, but neither the almost non -existent extreme right, nor meloni nor by supposed Vox are responsible for the slope for which we are sliding and that leads us to a very ugly place and in which, on top of that, we have already been. It begins to be time to really worry.
3715	1	Abortion: More socialist propaganda
3715	3	The absolute lack of pedagogy of the PP not only hinders the transmission of values ​​much more valid than those on the left, but also facilitates that people identify the right with the cartoon perpetrated by their ideological adversaries.
3715	5	Although, according to the CIS, only 29% of socialist voters accept abortion without any legal reserve and although some surveys estimate the potential loss of voters, the Socialist Youth (JSE) have disseminated another of those videos so manichaeous to those who already have accustomed us.
3715	7	In it, you can see a teenager on their backs who appreciates family and social support to his decision to abort while, as a background, a series of images appear that, in theory, come to convey the opposite of the good wishes that the girl He is expressing: Rajoy, Aznar, Rouco Varela and various anonymous protesters follow each other as representatives of what, for the JSE, it would be the "right" rancid. These puppies of progressivism have it clear: they are with women and their "right to decide"; The ultramontana right, on the other hand, postulates the need to criminalize and imprison abortion.
3715	9	It is interesting to observe how this progressive radicalization of these left -wing young people who, given the almost official structure of our political parties, will undoubtedly "the leaders of tomorrow" (there is the paradigmatic case of Leire Pajín) does not worry anyone within the PSOE nor of his related media. Perhaps it is because they have conceived from the beginning the need for their youths to be a quarry of propagandists and fans - two qualities that these raptors will refine over time to become ministers and presidents of the Government - or, more likely, because the socialists They are convinced to be able to bring the majority of the population to their radical positions and, therefore, to gain their vote for persuasion, not by assimilation.
3715	11	Attitude that undoubtedly contrasts with the Arrioliana strategy of appeasement and low profile that in many other topics has chosen the PP of Mariano Rajoy. An absolute lack of pedagogy that not only makes it difficult to transmit a message and values ​​much more valid than those on the left, but in this case it facilitates that people identify the right with the cartoon perpetrated by their ideological adversaries. If a party does not valently fill its program, if you do not clearly express what your ideas are and what you are leaving the opponent to distort them to convenience. And for this it is not enough to appear to be a moderate conciliatory, since the figure of the wolf with lamb skin is sufficiently disseminated in the popular imaginary so that four beautiful words manage to cancel the propaganda efficiency of socialism.
3715	13	In the video, for example, the non -existent right of women to decide is insisted again, that is, to abort, that is, to end the life of Nasciturus. If it is not sufficiently repeated that not every right is an extension of freedom, but that many of them are a mere screen to cut it, and that parents are not only holders of rights against Nasciturus but, especially, of obligations (since They are responsible for having placed it in that particular situation of dependence and helplessness), the battle will be lost in advance. Because a society digests much more easily the distribution of prebendas than the assumption of duties. It is that simple and very badly, things have to have been done from the political pulpit when the left continues to triumph when spreading slogans as fallacious as that the right wants to imprison women, without actually there has been a single imprisonment of An abortion from the approval of the Constitution.
3715	15	But there are the youth of the PSOE: defending the open bar against the rights of Nasciturus as if it were a sign of progress. It is not, therefore, that the PP now responds with another opposite sign video, but that their ideas are not hid rejection among the population.
3716	1	91,000 signatures in just one week against abortion
3716	3	The response of the associations provident to the public consultation of equality on the new law shows the opposition of a part of society
3716	5	"We are David in front of Goliath, we will always seem little, and we will always seem few." With these words, María Sánchez Galindo defines, one of the spokesmen of the Provida Association "Right to live", his fight without rest to stop the approval of a law - that of sexual and reproductive health and voluntary interruption of pregnancy - «against the that we are most of Spanish society, although they are not physically here today.
3716	7	The metaphor perfectly represents what happened yesterday at the gates of the Ministry of Equality. About twenty people - representing many more - responded with 91,0000 signatures, collected in just seven days, to the public consultation that the Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, opened to citizens to express their opinion on the new abortion law. It should be remembered that the Council of Ministers recently approved the Project for the Reform of Organic Law 2/2010, of March 3 of reform of the Law on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy, which will expand "rights" and eliminate Obstacles to abort (it is extended to children under 16 and 17, or persons with disabilities, without the need for permission from parents or legal guardians) or, as officially expressed "to exercise the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy", regulating Also the individual and constitutional law to the objection of awareness of the health personnel.
3716	9	«Each progressive government radicalizes the abortion law. A law that covers the murder of 90,000 children every year in Spain, and now wants to unprotect minors and the objection of awareness of doctors, ”said one of the spokesmen of the right to live, Miguel Tomás.
3716	11	The platform volunteers carried out a staging against the Ministry of Equality in which they represented the minister surrounded by sacks of money, because they consider that "the true objective of this law is to enrich the business of the abortion centers." "Thousands of people want to tell Minister Montero" no "to abortion and" yes "to life. And we would have liked to be able to talk to her and present our position, but it seems that he does not have time to attend to the associations that defend life, as he has it to receive those who defend death, ”Tomás clarified.
3716	13	Equality not only did not want to receive them, but has not accepted the physical delivery of the signatures, excusing in the argument that "this ministry does not have a physical record, so all records have to be electronic", in the words of the words of Building Security Manager. «This draws a lot of attention because, in addition, I, as a citizen I can enter a public administration. There is no public administration that can close my way, ”says María Sánchez Galindo to this newspaper.
3716	15	"Roe against Wade"
3716	17	The unprecedented filtration of the American political newspaper at the beginning of May on the existence of a draft - fined in February of this year - in which an agreement between magistrates of the Supreme Court is signed, which aims to revoke the current abortion law - In force since the ROE judgment against Wade- has generated a social, media and political stir of incalculable magnitude, inside and outside the United States.
3716	19	In that historic case of 1973, the highest judicial institution of the country ruled that the Constitution protects the freedom of a pregnant woman to choose to interrupt her pregnancy without excessive government restrictions. What has been a constitutional right for more than half a century seems to become a punishable crime.
3716	21	«We are at the ideal moment to fight because it is now when there is a social debate against abortion, which there was neither in 2010 nor in 1985. Not only in Spain but in the rest of the world. We, from the Citizen Go platform, which is the international branch of the ‘Make you hear’ platform, we are also fighting a battle in Washington, ”says Sánchez Galindo.
3716	23	"We will be pressing to get to the Constitutional Court, we will not stop." Provida associations prepare a joint demonstration for June 26.
3717	1	My abortion
3717	3	The logical thing would be that man could decide and opt for what they call "financial abortion", which is nothing other than disregarding the embryo and what it gives of itself
3717	5	An unfair scene, one of many, of "Brian's life" by the Monty Phyton, which these days is forwarded by WhatsApp: one of the insurgents confesses that he wants to be a woman. "From today I want to be Loreta, it is my right as a man," and ask him, "Why do you want to be a woman, Stan?", To which he replies: "Because I want to have children, men also have the right to have children" . In the end they conclude that they will fight against the Romans for the right to give birth to men although they cannot have children. This absurd sequence, which today would seem taken from the real press conference of the Council of Ministers when Irene Montero speaks, continues to make us laugh, fortunately, although the reason for the ciza is now a philosophical and progresses Soflama that demonstrates to what degree of ridicule It is able to breathe the new left.
3717	7	The same thing happens, you apologize, with the supposed right to women's abortion. To be the same before the law, abortion should not be just a woman's right, which the one who signs does not consider it like that, but also of man, since, in case of reaching pregnancy, the male has to Comply with the obligation to maintain, at least with a part, the newborn, until they are of legal age. If sex has been spoiled, yes it is yes, and both are equal conditions, the logical thing would be that man could decide and opt for what they call "financial abortion", which is nothing other than disregarding the embryo and That it gives itself, because otherwise we would not be the same before the law, which would make the men of the most rancid norms of the heteropatriarchy. This point, which will almost certainly underline the T.C, and that, of course, does not treat the United States Supreme Court or the Church, would mean a liberal petition that has nothing to do with religion or with nineteenth -century morals, by What is not successful to explain why the left is not made a monkey Phyton, this time seriously.
3718	1	The English Court, investigated for alleged supply of uniforms to the Islamic State
3718	3	Sources close to European intelligence services confirmed to Mil21 that El Corte Inglés has been investigated in relation to the supply of modern uniforms used by the Islamic State in the Wars of Syria and Iraq. Several intelligence services, which try to expose the supply networks of the jihadists, placed the Spanish department stores in the spotlight for their specialization in making military uniforms and by the entrance of Qatar in their board of directors, country whose sheikhs finance the terrorist Islamic State. The company created by Ramón Areces in 1935 has made tens of thousands of uniforms for years for the armies around the world, including Spanish. They are contracts that provide millionaire benefits to El Corte Inglés, since garments are manufactured in countries where labor cost is very low.
3718	5	The governments of China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia, among others, with salaries of less than a daily dollar and sun -to -sun schedules that use minors as labor in many cases, do not put obstacles to large Western textile companies for the Military clothing.
3718	7	The modern pixelated camouflage uniforms used by the Islamic State have been financed by Qatari sheikh
3718	9	European intelligence services such as German, Austrian, Dutch and Italian have long investigated the networks of suppliers of the Islamic State or Daesh, an aspect to which little attention is paid because the focus is always put on the weapons.
3718	11	However, the provisioning - the Picpuk Toyota relatives in which terrorists, mobile phones, radio and uniforms are traveling - is essential for the support of jihadist military machinery.
3718	13	Psychological weapon
3718	15	Within the provisioning, the uniforms represent a powerful psychological weapon for any regular army or armed movement: the uniforms project an image of cohesion and discipline, instill fear of the adversary, and raise the moral and self -esteem of the combatant when feeling an integral part of a respected organization or feared. That is why intelligence services were surprised by the modern pixelated desert camouflage uniforms used by the Islamic State terrorists, similar to those of the best armies in the world.
3718	17	At present, more than 60,000 jihadists are fighting in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, according to estimates of American and Russian intelligence.
3718	19	With its modern military uniform, the Islamic State tries to convince public opinion that the caliphate has a powerful army
3718	21	Daesh's propaganda videos of propaganda know the importance of uniforms to implement in world public opinion the image that the self -proclaimed "caliphate" has a powerful regular army.
3718	23	He caught the attention of the secret services that the uniforms appear in videos and photographs as if they had just been released, despite being used on the battlefield, which led them to think that there was an abundant supply.
3718	25	The English Corte-Qatar link
3718	27	That "abundance" led to investigating large textile companies that would be behind the preparation of uniforms for the Islamic State. The last summer of Qatar capital into the Spanish Textile company El Corte Inglés fired all the alarms, the aforementioned sources point out.
3718	29	There was the double circumstance that El Corte Inglés has specialized in the preparation in China of military uniforms and that Qatar had entered the shareholders of the Spanish company, initially with 10% of the capital (one billion euros).
3718	31	While Princes and Saudi institutions are responsible for financing the armament of the Islamic State, Qatari sheikhs have specialized in the chapter of the provisioning of jihadists.
3718	33	150,000 uniforms
3718	35	The investigation of European intelligence services on companies allegedly providing uniforms to the Islamic State remains open. The jihadists would have stored more than 150,000 uniforms of desert pixelated camouflage such as those that appear in the photographs that accompany this information.
3718	37	The published article is dated December 2015. Your sources close to European intelligence services must have TBO, for not having learned in 8 months who manufactured and commercialized the cited uniforms. With the desire to damage El Corte Inglés that I see there are already published the result of such arduous investigation. I smell like all this.
3718	39	Well, I do not understand that if they are so bad about their caliphate - that they are - we sell to them or their friends anything, that it is not poison to eat it and all the scoundrels that trade with them, and if He does the English Court, I want to know to not buy anything ever. Damn greed.
3718	41	I find that everything I have read, is very difficult to understand for the chaotic, and that politics and religion have me fed up. I want to have the whole earth to have peace, and that we continue to evolve in pursuit of a better living among the peoples because only Freedom will make us see the light of reason.
3718	43	The numbers do not match ... abundance of military costumes .... 300,000 jihadists fighting ..... .. 150,000 costumes. Something is wrong, or they do not enjoy the abundance they say in the article (since it plays a uniform for every two: s) or the numerical data are wrong. Could it be out of course?
3718	45	I don't know.
3718	47	I condemn the Daesh or ISIS as the one that most, but it caught my attention. ..
3718	49	I would not be surprised at all. Business does not prevail moral All this without reason. The saying was already foresaw: the covered ronpe the sack.
3718	51	We only have, try to change the course and our best weapon is the protection of human rights.
3718	53	Fear and selfishness will not take us out of World War 3, or the destruction of the planet.
3718	55	Synthesizing:
3718	57	The bottom of the matter is .... money.
3718	59	Why so much scandal? ... The Holy Mother Roman Catholic Church is involved (as a shareholder) in the well -known weapons, and no one shouts in heaven .... This is the corrupted human nature of a hypocritical ...
3718	61	You are right; "God" cursing El Corte Inglés for his alleged sale of uniforms to Daesh, which seems formidable (curse him for that action), but no one opens his mouth for the construction of 5 frigates for Saudi Arabia who, let's not forget is who is who More support the terrorist group because, who assures me that at one point these characters that even thank them, do not "lend the frigates to those fans?
3718	63	Incredible but you have to make laws that are violated are responsible how they do not say that European companies can and cannot do.
3718	65	The English Court is a multinational that Wue has known
3718	67	It is a solemn fool, perfectly could have sold any other company.
3718	69	The problem is to know who organized, financed and armed the Islamic State, not who sells uniforms, and we will know that in a few years.
3718	71	I don't think there is a western state that has not done business with them.
3718	73	That we can expect from a company such as El Corte Inglés whose current general director, Dimas Gimeno, nephew of the late Isidoro Álvarez, was part of the candidacies of the Spanish Falange Independent in the general elections of 1996.
3718	75	That terrorist group was formed by Great Britain, USA and Saudi Arabia. What they should investigate is those countries that are the ones that will have made the commission of uniforms. Or do you think that these terrorists have been formed by any Cape Furriel?
3718	77	Let's see if one day this rotten and immoral economic system ends, it reduces to the numerical balances of profits and losses. May we do everything that is in sample hand so as not to benefit it. Merry Christmas!!!
3719	1	The lies and the scam of climate change
3719	3	The so -called climate change before known as global warming, seems to be a great business for numerous institutions, although it is true that we approach an important change in the climate, in no case is it due to the hand of man or the so -called greenhouse effect produced by The CO2.
3719	5	There are important interests, fees, taxes and sanctions for those countries, industries and even you if you have a vehicle or company that exceeds the allowed limits of CO2 production, behind all this martemágnum of rigged data, sensational news of the large media of the large media Communication and unreliable climatic models, huge sums of money are hidden that juicy institutions such as the UN IPCC among others are distributed.
3719	7	On this, we talk in the program of lights and shadows, we hope you like it and serve you as another reference point outside the so -called unique thought.
372	1	The PP shoots and is already 36 seats from the absolute majority
372	3	Win for the first time to the left and the parties of the coalition collapse: they lose 1,639,154 votes and almost 40 deputies
372	5	The change in tendency in the distribution of support between the two blocks that Spanish politics have marked in recent years continues to consolidate after the historical majority that the popular Juan Manuel Moreno achieved in Andalusia in the last regional elections.
372	7	According to the last survey of NC Report, the first one made nationwide after these Andalusian elections, the PP shoots up to 138-140 seats, staying in its highest fork only 36 seats from the absolute majority. This was an unthinkable scenario for both the PSOE and the PP earlier this year, when the elections in Castilla y León had not yet been held. The pact in this Autonomous Community of the PP with Vox has had no collateral effect for the popular, as they predicted from the government, and yes to the Santiago Abascal party, which has also entered a weight loss phase.
372	9	If general elections were held today, the PP of Feijóo would achieve 32.2 percent of the votes, and recover up to 2,741,603 votes with respect to the previous generals. With much difference, it is the party that grows the most, and also on account of winning support at the expense of citizens, mainly, but also of Vox and the PSOE. In deputies, its growth would be between 49 and 51 deputies. Mariano Rajoy, in his last elections as a candidate, won and ruled with 137 deputies: his party would now exceed that barrier.
372	11	The growth of the popular is linked to the extinction of citizens, which only retains an act of the ten that it achieved in the general elections of November 2019.
372	13	Change of trend in Vox
372	15	But the most striking of this first survey after the Andalusian autonomics is the change of tendency in Vox. Its resistance, which seemed to pump proof, gives its first symptoms of weakness because it begins to suffer losses in its electoral barn, up to 173,859 votes, and between seven and nine deputies.
372	17	The two parties would exceed the absolute majority, but if the electoral radiography that announces this survey, Alberto Núñez Feijóo to force a solo government, as the PP has done in Madrid and in Andalusia. At least with that goal would sit at the negotiating table in the absence of seeing the position set by the formation of Santiago Abascal.
372	19	On the left the collapse leaves them without an alternative majority. Nor adding to all the nationalist, independence and other minorities Pedro Sánchez would be able to form government.
372	21	This is because the PSOE continues to leave support on the road, which in numbers suppose up to 866,058 votes and between 25 and 27 deputies. In fact, today it would stay in the fork of the 93-95 deputies. But the votes that lose the socialists do not go to the brand of Unidos Podemos, not even under the expectation of that new "sum" platform that has already presented the vice president of the Government and Minister of Labor, Yolanda Díaz. The dwellings leave another 773,096 votes and between 10 and 12 deputies. A full -fledged collapse of the coalition experiment.
372	23	The data they handle in Ferraz are no more optimistic, on the contrary, they confirm this state of "free fall" in which they lose votes on all sides, hence the strategic urgency of finding formulas to mobilize the left -wing voter. By the way, the survey was elaborated coinciding with the debate of the State of the Nation and when Sánchez's popular announcement was already known to impose new taxes on banking and energy. However, estimates do not yet detect any effect in favor of the PSOE thanks to these ads.
372	25	In those days the resignation of Adriana Lastra was also known as deputy secretary of the party and was on the street the expectations of changes in the organization chart of Ferraz to reinforce the structure after the Andalusian debacle.
372	27	Fidelity of the voter of the PP
372	29	In this context, the PP reinforces the loyalty of its voter, unlike what happens to the rest of the matches. The popular retain 95.7 percent of those who trusted him in the last generals, a percentage that in the case of the PSOE touches 80 percent. But we still go to this field, because 30 percent of its voters escape. The formation of Santiago Abascal, meanwhile, retains 83.5% of its faithful.
372	31	And of the "guts" of the survey, the most favorable data for Genoa is its ability to steal vote on the right and left. From the PSOE, it captures 8.9 percent of the support that the Socialists received in the last general elections. Vox, 14.8 percent. And citizens, up to 67.5 percent. Precisely, this fact, also tested in the internal surveys that the popular handle, is the main reason for increasing optimism in the PP on their electoral expectations.
372	33	In a complicated economic context, and with the flying goal of the regional and municipal of May of next year, in which they believe they will also play with advantage, the possibility of reaching a majority so solid begin to consider that it approaches the absolute.
372	35	After so many years of political fragmentation, this hypothesis implies a radical change of trend, since it would be a consequence of the process of disinflaring the new policy, also both to the right and left.
372	37	By ages, the Popular Party appears in this survey for the first time as the most voted party in all segments, also among the youngest, where it is imposed on Vox, PSOE and Podemos (which until now was the preferred option between voters of 18 29 years old). His largest vote bag is between those over 45.
3720	1	The employer asks the administrations to establish work quotas for migrants in sectors such as Rural
3720	3	The vice president of the CEOE, González de Lara, is favorable to rational migratory processes, provided that "there are job offers for those who come to settle
3720	5	There are few times in which the news brought out the labor exploitation to which they subject to immigrant people certain entrepreneurs. Too many. The socioeconomic inclusion of this group remains a pending subject in Spain. Its job and salary stability is scarce.
3720	7	According to the study 'A roots on the wire' presented by Cáritas in September of the year 2020 together with the University Institute of Migration Studies of the Pontifical University of Comillas (IUEM), 75% occupy forced and poorly paid jobs. The migrant population that arrives in our country is mostly young, with an average age of 36 years.
3720	9	Regarding the level of studies, migrants have very similar training levels to those of the Spanish population, since while 29% of nationals have higher studies, the percentage is 23% among Latin American foreigners, a figure very similar. Some data on human capital that do not marry their bad working conditions and precarious labor development.
3720	11	Entrepreneurs claim administrations to establish work quotas for immigrants
3720	13	In this sense, the vice president of the CEOE, Javier González de Lara, has been favorable in Ecclesia to Spain promoting rational immigration processes "where there are job offers for those who come to settle." A set of actions that Spain does not end up.
3720	15	For the number two of the representative of the business sector, they are the public administrations that are responsible for helping business to establish “quotas in certain activities such as rural areas, where there are less and less Spanish workers who want to work and allow certain quotas Immigration can do so normally. There are provinces in Spain that do so, ”said González de Lara in Ecclesia.
3720	17	In line with this demand, the Vice President of the CEOE has put as an example the US model that, in his opinion, has managed to establish his labor market "thanks to migratory processes that have enriched jobs and social integration," he says.
3721	1	Vox seeks to alleviate the effects of the "nefarious energy policy" of the last decades
3721	3	The Vox parliamentary group in the Courts of Castilla y León today registered two parliamentary initiatives in the face of the economic emergency situation that Spain lives, motivated by the lack of energy sovereignty and the political erratic carried out by the different governments of the Nation in the Last decades in everything related to the management of this strategic sector.
3721	5	Therefore, the parliamentary group has registered a proposition of the Law of Modification of Law 7/2021, of May 20, on Climate Change and Energy Transition, for the inclusion of the concept of energy sovereignty and the reversal of the prohibition of exploration, Research and exploitation of own, mineral and energy resources.
3721	7	Spain has the possibility of producing much of the energy necessary for its needs, thus reducing the energy dependence and the negative effects that this entails. Therefore, the legal system must correspond to a favorable legislation to the investigation of new energy deposits, as well as its exploration and exploitation.
3721	9	Although Vox considers that the national legislative initiative corresponds to the General Courts, we contemplate the appeal of autonomous legislative initiative as a useful way to open, in parallel to the actions of the parliamentary group in Congress, a debate at the parliamentary level on a proposal that is Crucial for the economic and social development of Spain. Given the current situation, all the political force of which Vox has a progress in everything related to our energy sovereignty is necessary and revokes the negligent decisions that have deindustrialized and impoverished to the nation. Therefore, Vox will present in all the autonomous communities where a proposal of law has to process in the Congress of Deputies in the terms already expressed.
3721	11	On the other hand, also today, the parliamentary group has registered a non -law proposition in favor of the prospecting and exploitation of the mining resources of Spain for its debate and approval before the Plenary. The position taken by the European Union and blindly followed by the Government of Spain that advocates the total dismantling of the carboniferous sector is known, completely renouncing one of the energy resources that our country has. A policy that time has demonstrated erroneous and that only obeys the impositions of climate fanaticism and the interests of environmental lobbies.
3721	13	The energy emergency we currently suffered has revealed a reality denied by many for years: that the closure of the coal sector and thermal plants was a precipitous and erroneous decision that was carried out without thinking about the interests of our region. Reality is demonstrating as coal can serve as a reserve element to cover crisis situations like the current one.
3721	15	Therefore, the Vox parliamentary group in the Courts of Castilla y León urges the Junta de Castilla y León so that in turn, the Government of Spain to take the following measures:
3722	1	The 'silent invasion' begins to be listed with an increase in arrivals that exceeds 700%
3722	3	Vox describes as ‘invasion’ what happened during the last months in the Canary Islands, where citizens and the State Security Forces and Bodies are in a situation that qualify as "unsustainable." Last weekend, he was a victim of the worst data so far, with the arrival of more than 2,000 illegal immigrants.
3722	5	The wave began during the early hours of Saturday, when the arrival of 16 boats transported 643 illegal. Hours later, two Cayucos with 271 people entered the coast of Tenerife. El Hierro, at the same time received a Cayuco with 159 immigrants on board. During the last hours of the day, there was the landing of another boat, which transported 23 illegal.
3722	7	Saturday's day finally resulted in more than 1,100 immigrants arriving at our coasts.
3722	9	On Sunday it began very early for the members of the State Security Forces and Bodies that, during the early morning, received the notice of the arrival of 3 pateras with 600 immigrants aboard the coasts of Gran Canaria. After the first hours of the day, 85 illegal landed on the beach of Santiago, in La Gomera. Subsequently, in another expedition to the north of the Island of Hierro, Maritime Rescue had to help a drift boat with 45 illegal. Later, the Civil Guard and Maritime Rescue received the worst news: 115 immigrants spread over six pateras, in groups of 30,29,25,23 and 4 were about to arrive at the Arguineguín dock, one of the hottest points of illegal immigration , where thousands of illegal are overcrowded.
3722	11	Sunday's day concluded with the arrival of 900 illegal immigrants. However, the 112 has confirmed that the activity was not ceased from Sunday to the state security forces and security forces, which continued to work on the rescue of paters and Cayucos. In total, around 2,500 illegal landed in the Canary Islands in just over 48 hours and 7,000 in the last four weeks. Currently, health authorities are doing PCR tests to immigrants. So far, 45 have tested positive in COVID-19.
3722	13	The National Police Union, Jupol, published a statement to be aware of the events lived this weekend, denouncing the situation in which the Police is, who works day by day at the reception of pateras. It condemned the lack of means, both human and material, something that prevents them from working in good condition, as is the case of the Arguineguín dock, where they are forced to bend their shifts.
3722	15	On the other hand, the police denounce that, while immigrants are performed PCR tests in a completely free way, the State Security Forces and Bodies, which are in continuous contact with the illegal ones, are not facilitated by such tests , which puts both them and their families at risk. They claim that they have "overwhelmed, unattended and without reaction capacity" to the agents in charge of the mission.
3722	17	To the government already permissive of the Government with illegal immigration, we must also add the situation that one of the countries from where more immigrants save: Morocco. And, since there is a special restriction in border politics, it becomes very difficult to return the illegal, something that the mafias take advantage of.
3722	19	Santiago Abascal, more than a year ago and being aware of the problem, described the wave of illegal immigration as a silent invasion, and affirmed that measures should be taken immediately, since it is a very serious threat to health, security and coexistence of the Spaniards.
3722	21	In fact, Vox demanded a protocol for the reception of pateras months ago with the aim of identifying positive cases and preventing outbreaks that may not be controlled.
3723	1	Why not 5% of illegal immigrants return orders do not run?
3723	3	The National Deputy of the Formation by Ceuta, Teresa López, denounces this situation after checking with the data provided by interior that, since 2019, the percentage of expelled immigrants has struck in a chopped reaching that it is executed so far from 2022 just a 2, 8% of the return orders issued.
3723	5	The parliamentarian Ceutí had already asked about the expulsion orders of illegal immigrants in June. Then the response of the National Executive was that the return orders issued by irregular entry are executed within its validity period and that the provisions of the regulations are complied with. However, from Moncloa they did not provide data.
3723	7	Therefore, López registered a new battery of questions to learn about how many return orders have been executed in the last three years, as well as for 2022. Also how many have been dictated and how many return files have been dismissed in The last three years and in the course of 2022. To the latter, the Government does not respond, but the other data it offers are revealing and so regrets Vox.
3723	9	Thus, of the 27,821 return orders issued in 2019, 5,393 were executed, which represents 19.37%. A percentage already low for the National Deputy of VOX, but that it falls in the 2020 Only 4.35%.
3723	11	In 2021 the situation continues to go worse and López denounces it, which regrets how despite the fact that the return orders increase considerably, in the same proportion the number of those that are executed falls. According to the data of the Sánchez Government, 42,614 return orders of which only 1,417 -32%were executed last year - and so far from 2022 18,678 of these orders have been registered, but they have barely taken carried out 539 returns -2.88% -.
3723	13	"Despite the reluctance of the government to give us these data, and others that still do not offer us to my questions, those we have in this answer are very revealing," says López. And this, he points out, is because the chartered flights from Las Palmas and Melilla, or transfers from Ceuta to the Peninsula are common, while the Ministry of Interior, with Marlaska in the lead, does not execute orders to expulsion from people in illegal situation in Spain. Thus the Executive facilitates that, after transfers, immigrants disperse, since they have outpatient freedom as long as the expulsion is not executed. "Something intolerable," López warns to add that Vox will continue to claim that these orders be executed in compliance with the law.
3724	1	Gamarra Sánchez about the nationalists: "Did they stop being investigated once he obtained his votes?"
3724	3	"What cannot deny is that, as president of the Government, he was aware of who was investigated and why," he says.
3724	5	He adds that "one of the doubts that everyone has and has to clarify is, knowing what they knew, what kind of political relationship established with the investigated and what agreements came with them." "This is the key and this is what we ask today," he says.
3724	7	The popular leader emphasizes that, as published, "her government suffered weeks before her investiture that, by court, was spying on prominent ERC leaders for their connection with violent revolts in Catalonia."
3724	9	On the other hand, he reminds Sánchez that, in January 2020, “He was invested president by a narrow margin: 167 votes in favor of 165 against. The key were 18 abstentions of two parliamentary groups: Esquerra and Bildu ”. "They are who you should be president today," he emphasizes.
3724	11	"Have you already made enough concessions to independence for your parliamentary support or do you still have many to do and what are they?" He urges him to respond.
3724	13	It replicates the chief of the Executive that "it is a real nonsense to negotiate the investiture of a government with which they were being investigated for the danger they supposed for the rule of law in Spain."
3724	15	Gamarra says that "there is no greater concession to the independentistas than to deliver the governance of a country to whom the threat to the constitutional order is."
3724	17	"If you knew they were a danger and that they were being investigated, how is it possible to open the doors of the Moncloa and sit with them to negotiate?" "This does not happen in any democracy in the world," he emphasizes.
3724	19	"By the way, did you stop being investigated once you obtained your parliamentary votes or did you decide after meeting with them in La Moncloa?" He asks showing an image of a meeting of the dialogue table in February 2020. “Answer, Because this is one of the keys to his legislature, ”he says.
3724	21	“His government was born from a diabolical pact. You knew who he agreed with and that he couldn't go well. And you were able to assume many debts. The big problem is that you are willing to pay them all. Let's see if all Spaniards tell us here what he will deliver at his next meeting to Pere Aragonese spied, ”he concludes.
3725	1	Abortion Law, or the photo that Feijóo avoids and that will portray its tuning with Abascal
3725	3	Last week it transpired that Alberto Núñez Feijóo secretly met Santiago Abascal, hiding the appointment to avoid photographs that showed the harmony between the head of the opposition and the outraged right. He even shielded that he also saw himself with the Minister of Labor, Yolanda Díaz. But there are much more powerful and revealing scenes and moments than a photograph. This Thursday, the Popular Group bench will melt with that of Vox during the debate on the reform of the Abortion Law.
3725	5	The Plenary will address paths of return registered by PP and Vox to the Organic Law of Sexual and Reproductive Health and on the voluntary interruption of pregnancy. The articles, promoted by the Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, was approved on August 30 in the Council of Ministers and collects, among other issues, access to abortion without paternal permission for children under 16 and 17 years. The three days of reflection are also suppressed and it is guaranteed that the public network of hospitals always counts with personnel available for pregnancy interruptions to women who require it.
3725	7	Genoa rejects the norm, but does not propose alternative. The reason is evident: avoid generating an internal debate that opens the party on the channel. In the PP different sensibilities coexist with diametrically opposed opinions about abortion. There are deputies that integrate the hardest nucleus that they are directly betting on prohibiting this practice, while the most liberal wing, where Isabel Díaz Ayuso is, who advocate allowing minors to abort even without the paternal consent.
3725	9	Alberto Núñez Feijóo, in May, rejected Irene Montero's proposal. According to their criteria, women aged 16 and 17 should need the authorization of their parents and, in case they would refuse, it would be a family judge who made the final decision after studying the case.
3725	11	Feijóo avoided the photo, but the scene that shows his tuning with Abascal is inescapable
3725	13	An impossible debate for the PP
3725	15	The PP avoids the debate at all costs that the Constitutional Court must still resolve the appeal presented by its party 12 years ago on the law approved by the PSOE. The popular intend to return to the Law of deadlines and assumptions of 1985, which did not contemplate abortion until 14 weeks, until 12. Organic Law 9/1985, the first that regulated the voluntary interruption of pregnancy, was coined by Felipe González. Abortion decriminalized in three assumptions: at any time whenever the pregnant life or physical or psychic health of the pregnant woman, in the first 12 weeks in case of rape and in the first 22 weeks if the fetus Go to be born with "serious physical or psychic taras."
3725	17	In 2009, the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero approved a new abortion law. This is the Organic Law 2/2010 on sexual and reproductive health and the voluntary interruption of pregnancy, which allows free abortion in the first 14 weeks, in the first 22 if there is a risk of “serious anomalies” for the fetus and in Any time if fetal anomalies are detected incompatible with life. Likewise, the minimum age to abort without the need for paternal authorization was established for 16 years. It is only forced to inform one of the minor representatives except if there was a risk of "serious conflict" or danger of "domestic violence."
3725	19	With the arrival of the Popular Party to the Government, with Mariano Rajoy in front, the Executive prepared to reform the law. It is then that Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón proposed through a preliminary draft of law eliminating free abortion and was limited to the assumptions of rape within the first 12 weeks or in case of risk for the physical or psychic health of the mother. It suppressed, thus, the assumption introduced in 1985 that took into account the possible abnormalities of the fetus. The draft was withdrawn and only abortion was reformed in cases of minors, whose parents would have to give their consent.
3725	21	Vox, death and a revealing frame
3725	23	While the PP hesitates, Vox does not tremble his voice. Ultra -rightist training rejects the reform of the Abortion Law because it understands that "despises the most fundamental of rights", the "natural law" of human life. "Faced with the culture of death, Vox defends life from conception to its natural extinction," they rive. Be that as it may, PP and Vox will position themselves from the same side not only in this matter, but also in the veto to the casualties due to disability derived from painful menstruation. Feijóo avoided the photo, but the scene that shows his tuning with Abascal is inescapable.
3726	1	The two political options left by the Ukraine War
3726	3	The two political options left by the Ukraine War
3726	5	Tensions in international relations continue to increase. We are in a complex geopolitical moment dominated in two different ways of seeing the world, also in the West
3726	7	Germany continues in the center of the storm. It occupies a relevant position at this geopolitical moment and the direction it takes in the coming years will be crucial: it is a country in which the dilemmas of the time are synthesized well.
3726	9	In the first instance, the closure of the Russian energy supply, which especially convenient Berlin, has led the country towards a new scenario. It is not just about having enough energy, but it is available at an affordable price. The impossible medium -term replacement of Russian sources for others of similar cost is remarkable damage to the German State, for its citizens and especially for its industry, a fundamental sector in its dominant position in Europe.
3726	11	That change forces Germany to redirect their economic priorities. And the direction he has taken did not like the EU. France is increasingly unhappy, and the rest of the countries do not see much less the measures taken by Berlin: the large amounts that are investing in its economy to compensate for the increase in gas prices and help families and companies and companies , which add to those already in circulation during and after the pandemic, they suppose a large competitive advantage over their European partners.
3726	13	The visit to China
3726	15	In that reorganization scenario, Scholz's visit has occurred to Beijing, the next step. In this new cold war, Berlin is suffering pressures to reduce its commercial relationship with China. At the same time, incentives lead to strengthening it, because China is its main commercial partner, and giving up that relationship, or weakening it, would mean additional damage to a country that will have to face complicated times.
3726	17	The Chinese market is part of the foundations in which the bases of German economic prosperity settled
3726	19	As a result of these contradictions, we had industry leaders pointing to Scholz's visit to Beijing as very pertinent, since Europe and the world depend on China in many aspects, also to solve problems such as climate change and food security, at the same time That the Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, showed a much more hostile position to those relationships. The Chinese official media proclaim that the separation of Germany with their country is not realistic, since the Chinese market is among the foundations that laid the foundations of German economic prosperity. The result of the visit was exposed by Global Times, the official Chinese newspaper, in this way: “Germany and China put the emphasis on increasing mutual understanding and trust, in adhering to economic globalization, promoting practical cooperation, opposing Block confrontation and intensify coordination and cooperation in international matters. Scholz again made clear his opposition to decoupling. ”
3726	21	The German version of that visit has not been so complacent. Probably, the best summary of the situation has been done by Wolfgang Müchau: “What is happening in Germany is that the entire economic model, based on cheap energy and exports of machinery to countries like China, has reached the limit. Germany will need to diversify in a direction that Scholz and his industrial friends are largely unknown. ”
3726	23	The two ways to see the world
3726	25	So Germany has to move in several swampy lands: internally, because the decoupling of Russian energy causes problems and because its economic model is now much weaker; with its EU partners, who claim a better output of the crisis; and with the US and China, who ask for opposite things.
3726	27	Scholz's role is complicated because geopolitical demands push him in one direction and the economic ones in another. Do what you do, you will receive criticism: it is not possible to content everyone at the same time.
3726	29	However, it would be unfair to put the focus exclusively in Germany, because the dominant country in Europe is nothing more than the living expression of a symptom, that of Western contradictions.
3726	31	The US is playing its letters to strengthen and stop the emerging power
3726	33	In essence, in our political and economic systems, two logics are being confronted, two ways of thinking. The first sees American hegemony, observes very concern the Chinese ascent and tries to establish a powerful dike that prevents that growth from leading Beijing to lead the world. We cannot forget that confrontation with Russia is part of this. For this type of mentality, it is not only the military front. The open and globalized world in which we have lived would lead China to settle firmly, so, with Trump, the USA began a protectionist turn, which Biden has implemented. There are many elements linked to energy, the defense of the dollar and strategic goods, but basically the US is playing its letters to strengthen and stop the emerging power.
3726	35	The other type of logic, more financial, wants capitals to flow, that cheap and regular production continue to encourage exchanges between countries and that investment opportunities and dividends increase. For this way of thinking, the natural thing is that a good part of globalization will be preserved, that Chinese markets open, that hostilities cease and that the open world of the past preserves as much as possible.
3726	37	The problem is that both logics collide: you can't have both at the same time. For that to happen, Beijing would have to adopt a very different perspective, and in Moscow you would have to live the overthrow of Putin and her replacement by a friendlier leader with Washington. Both things would allow globalization to still have a great route. Since it seems very unlikely, we will live a clash between both ways of seeing the world that will define our future.
3726	39	A decoupling without desire
3726	41	Until now, we are not living a determined confrontation between these two positions, but attempts to make balances between one and the other. There is a kind of dissociation: while on the military and technological level the Cold War is already declared, with an evident decoupling in some strategic sectors, on the economic level the steps that are being taken are very weak. It is as if it was intended to use a very firm rhetoric on one ground while in the other it was intended that things continue to develop in the same way, but applying small adjustments; As if deglobalization could be selective.
3726	43	Global bankers are "very pro-china," said UBS President Colm Kelleher
3726	45	That attempt to play with two decks at the same time becomes complicated, and especially for the West. It is perceived in Germany, but also in the US. A few days ago, Biden pointed to oil companies, of which he claimed that they were taking advantage of the circumstances to obtain great profits, sometimes going against the interests of US consumers and the same state. Biden sees little patriotic that they take a party of the crisis and allocate it to dividends and repurchases of shares, but their companies answer that, in short, what is more American than to earn all the money you can. The US government insists that the companies in their country move away from China, something that many deny, because it would mean losing the advantages of that cheap production that Asia brings. And the global bankers are all "very pro-china", as said the president of UBS, Colm Kelleher. That explains that, while in the discursive field, in the technological and in the energy, the battle with China is launched, in many other areas things have changed very little. In short, the strategic needs of a country often confront the interests of its main economic actors. Germany is an obvious case, but it is also the US.
3726	47	At the same time, as the US has decided to reinforce in national terms to deal with China, tensions with its western partners increase. The types of types of types by the Fed and the demands that Europe move away from China complement each other with incentives to locate companies in the US, also with the promise that they will have enough energy and at a good price. That attitude is causing discontent in Germany and France, which warn that, if Washington continues on that path, they will have to do the same. Without going any further, Macron complained bitterly that the US was offering Europe liquefied gas at a price four times higher than the one he sells in his country and Bruno Le Maire, French Economy Minister, said yesterday that “the real risk for Europe It is that he stays technologically, industrially and economically, leaving the Free field to the US and China. Let us give the means to reindustrialize Europe. ”
3726	49	In other words, the contradiction between the two logics, which leads to national reinforcement and which aims to preserve as much global order in force, is first operating in internal terms, causing differences within the western countries and between Those same countries. It is natural, to the extent that in this new cold war there are many things to decide yet, and the European role is one of them. The normal thing is that the coming years bring the prioritization of the strategic, in a very wide reading of the term, especially because China and Russia, as well as the US, are operating in those terms, and that changes the passage of the rest of the countries.
3726	51	Germany continues in the center of the storm. It occupies a relevant position at this geopolitical moment and the direction it takes in the coming years will be crucial: it is a country in which the dilemmas of the time are synthesized well.
3727	1	Full to zero on the left left
3727	3	Yesterday we propose in the program a survey on the so -called parental pin. We ask the listeners, specifically, "do you agree that parents are asked before giving children no moral talk in schools?"
3727	5	We have rarely had such an overwhelming response in a tweet. More than 95% of the 3,800 people who responded did so affirmatively. Only 4.5% expressed their disagreement to consult parents. Which comes to demonstrate that this from parental pin is one of those issues where society goes on the one hand and political parties on the other.
3727	7	That is why the battle of public opinion is won in this matter: when people tell them to choose between the freedom to choose and impositions, they usually prefer the freedom to choose. How strange these human beings are, right?
3727	9	And what are curious are the effects of this type of controversy, because what the PSOE is achieving is that those of Vox, with Santi Abascal in front, appear as the flag bearers of freedom. Both effort to present them as dangerous fascists, in order to give them the image of defenders of the rights of people in the face of politicians' impositions! You can't be more clumsy than this left.
3727	11	And not only that: Sánchez has managed to undress himself, making the contradictions emerge. His announcement to bring the decision of the Murcian government to the courts makes its commitment to "dejudicialize" what is related to ‘procés’ as what it is: a gift to those who humiliate and insult Spain and the Spaniards daily.
3727	13	With which, the progre left has achieved a "full to zero": it remains as totalitarian, places Vox as defender of freedom and his speech on the Catalan theme is self -prosmonta. Who could ask for more?
3727	15	Which leads us to the final conclusion. Contrary to what has happened in the last 15 years, all ideological battles must be given. All. Because winning them is much easier than it seems. The progressive left, with its tendency to social engineering, is ordinanced by definition. Not to mention your passion for taking advantage of anything to set up a beach bar. Both things (impositions and trend to chiringuito) have a very bad press. Let's take advantage of it.
3728	1	Warm -ups doing the Egyptian
3728	3	This summit, specifically, exceeds in a degree of stupidity to all the above, a merit nothing negligible because the bar was very high.
3728	5	The "Climate Climate" summit that Moratinos would say, started this last Sunday in Egypt and will last fifteen days, because in less time it is impossible to concentrate the speeches, bilateral encounters and round tables of such importance that they will take place. It will be two weeks, throughout which the world leaders will quarrel to the fucking humanity while enjoy year.
3728	7	The UN Secretary General says that "we are on a road to climate hell with the foot in the accelerator" so "humanity only has one option: cooperate or perish." If he believed what he says, he would have to put a chichonera and lock him in a padded room, because it would be evident that the guy has crazy. But in reality it is an imposed script to fulfill the role that is expected of the presiding institution, a dark international organization dedicated to large -scale corruption, the promotion of climate horror campaigns and the massive violation of minors wherever it has presence on the ground.
3728	9	This summit, specifically, exceeds in a degree of stupidity to all the above, a merit nothing negligible because the bar was very high. The 150 aircraft that will carry and bring dignitaries from every corner of the world will launch more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than all Spanish agriculture in a year, which gives a measure of the degree of hypocrisy of all these characters. But, if it is about reducing the CO2 of the atmosphere, nothing can be more absurd than call part of all greenhouse gases produced by humanity.
3728	11	But what is treated in these socialist afflicts is not to study a real threat, but to feed the planetary psychosis to justify the eradication of spaces for freedom and, meanwhile, enrich the elites better connected to power. From that point of view it is very appropriate for the meeting to be held in the land of the pharaohs because, in effect, its participants are there to do the Egyptian: with the hand in front they threaten you and with that from behind they make a money. Approximately half, what the government has previously stolen. The other half is for campaigns by calling "waste" the elderly who are going to go cold in winter; Not for climate change, but for the decisions of all the scoundrels that these days will enjoy the benefits of global warming in one of the most luxurious spas in the world.
3728	13	You'll return, Sánchez, you'll return.
3729	1	My carbon footprint and me
3729	3	Not everyone leaves the same carbon footprint throughout our consumerist, insolidary and sinful life.
3729	5	The Government and the great IBEX companies promote that each person calculates their carbon footprint, so that eco -state idiots determine the degree of bad consciousness that each one must assume by being contributing to global warming. There is no distinction here between the inhabitants of the cities and rural areas, since we are ultimate Rome.
3729	7	But not everyone leaves the same carbon footprint throughout our consumerist, insolidary and sinful life. The people of the field, obviously, not only causes a carbonic footprint of less depth than the urbanites, but, in fact, theirs is clearly negative. Let's make simple numbers.
3729	9	A farmer who dedicates 50 years of his life to work in the field will have used 125,000 hours to increase the green mass of the planet, performing plantations and taking care of groves. In the case of the planters, fundamental to create fruit or citrus trees that then fill hectares and more hectares of land, it is a fundamental activity that counteracts the carbon footprint until we place it negative levels. For example, during the graft season (August-September) a farmer produces 6,000 new trees, which after 40 years will have become 240,000. Let's keep in mind this data.
3729	11	The Ministry of Ecological Transition, the University Departments dedicated to the Environment and environmental organizations have established equivalence tables to encourage everyone to compensate for our carbon footprint. Thus, they tell us that a tree compensates throughout its life for CO2 emissions of 100 cars in one day or that one hectare of grove is equivalent to the carboniferous footprint of a person for a whole year.
3729	13	Making simple calculations, we have that the farmer of our example has balanced the carbon footprint of 6,575 cars for 10 years or that of 6.4 people throughout their lives. Multiply this product throughout the population that is dedicated to agriculture, livestock, forestry or any other activity aimed at keeping the rural environment alive and we will have a fairly precise image of who should make an act of contrition and suffer the consequences of delusions Regulations that impose us to delay the inevitable climate apocalypse.
3729	15	In my particular case, after dedicating 6 years of my youth to work in the field, I have compensated for contamination of 1,644 cars for ten years. At this point, the question is evident how many wind turbines of those who shave the mountains and destroy the birds can I dynamite?
373	1	Ayuso also echoes the Bulo on the Animal Protection Law
373	3	The president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, participated this Saturday in a day of the Popular Party under the name 'Ecology and Climate Change', where she has starred in a controversial intervention where she has continued spreading the bulle about the new protection law Animal.
373	5	His participation was based, mainly, on criticizing the president of the Government, Pedro Sánchez, who has assured that "lies, lies and lies", to denounce the performance of the left when facing climate change, intervening, intervening, According to her, she warned, in the economy or establishing "asphyxiating, liberticidal control, about people's lives, imposing without criteria a new way of thinking, consuming and living."
373	7	Keeping the speech, the president has accused the coalition government of "sowing panic" and establishing the "endless list of prohibitions that have prepared." Among them, children can adopt a hamster.
373	9	This bulge first appeared this week in the Ana Terradillos program, four a day, when the journalist alarmed her audience with completely false news about the animal protection law, ensuring that she intended to withdraw the condition of domestic animal to Turtles, hamster and parakeets and, in addition, "lifelong pets about to disappear from our homes." United Sources Podemos, they had to go out publicly to deny the news and cross out the journalist as "one of the most obvious examples of junk journalism."
3730	1	The western invention of moderate Islamism
3730	3	Summer diary: the western invention of moderate Islamism
3730	5	I still don't understand why you have to choose between the plague and anger.
3730	7	A group of some sixty liberal-conservative sign intellectuals, that is, Bernard Henry-Levy and a lot of American professors have directed a letter to Obama, urging him to punish the misdeeds of the Syrian tyrant and proposing, how could it be less, a plan For the future and after the armed intervention that passes through the agreements of the laity and liberals of Syria with what is usually called "moderate Islamism", a fed up -necessary ally to avoid the lucrative path of Libya, Egypt and other spring Arab areas, now yermas and agosted by the Civil War.
3730	9	The problem of moderate Islam is that it does not exist. There are Islamists, such as Saudi who are allies of the USA, but whose liberal civilization fights in their country in blood and veil. There are Islamists who proclaimed themselves moderate and compatible with the democratic and secular political forces, but as soon as they came to power, they released and took out the fanaticism they carry inside, carrying in Egypt the return of the military supported by those same lay people that they believed the pact with what they call moderate Islam, and that it is not known very well what it is.
3730	11	I imagine that they refer to these Islamic countries under Western influence in which the corruption of political, civilians such as in Morocco or military as in Egypt, allow certain sectors of society to escape the suffocating theocracy. But that is not Islam or moderation, it is absolutely arbitrary tolerance and managed through corruption. Better than mulás, of course, but far from that moderate Islamism, which, for political-military effects, only exists, oh, out of Islam. And that now it will serve as an intellectual alibi to help the wildly immoderate Islamists fighting savagery, not precisely anti-islamic or freeing, Assad and its allies of Tehran, Moscow and Havana. I still don't understand why you have to choose between the plague and anger.
374	1	Climate change: lessons learned by the world
374	3	Someone always has to pay the invoice, whether companies, consumers, taxpayers or politically helpless.
374	5	If it is not broken, the government will break it. That seems to be the lesson to extract from other nations that have launched energy plans against climate change similar to those that Obama recently proposed in his climate action plan.
374	7	· Australia. The impulse of Australia's tax on carbon dioxide is diminishing as costs and difficulties in managing it cause ravages. Many companies that already suffered from the hard economic situation were taken to the limit for higher energy prices, partly because of the mandates for renewable energy and carbon tax. Last year, Australia saw how 10,632 companies broke, a record for a single year. Nearly a fifth of them belonged to the large energy consuming industry and construction. The Australian Tourism Service also expects the tourism industry to pay $ 155 million annually in extra costs due to the increase in energy prices, specifically due to carbon tax. As a result of this and with the September elections approaching, there are doubts that the tax will survive far beyond its first anniversary.
374	9	· Germany. After the Fukushima (Japan) nuclear accident, the German government promised to replace nuclear energy with renewables, establishing the objective that 40% of the nation's electricity comes from renewable energy by 2020. Electricity prices are They have increased 10% since the current government came to power and it is expected that the surcharge in the electrical invoice to subsidize renewables will increase again. The number of unemployed and low income families that is running out of electricity is also increasing, as well as firewood thefts. In Germany, electricity is on its way to quickly becoming a luxury. Meanwhile, relatively low energy prices in the United States have attracted at least one of the main chemical companies in Germany, BASF.
374	11	· Spain. While the German government has made the costs of the obligation to use renewable energies in electricity users, Spain has transferred that burden to electricity companies. The combination of a highly subsidized renewable energy generation and the requirement that electricity bought renewable energy left these companies in 2012 with a deficit of $ 7.3 billion, which add up to the accumulated deficit during the last decade of $ 34,040 million. In addition to all that, green jobs still have to cause impact on the unemployment of Spain and in fact it is estimated that 2.2 jobs have been lost for each "green" job created by subsidies. Spain only goes behind Greece in terms of unemployment index within the European Union. Therefore, it does not imply a surprise that the Spanish government has reversed in exorbitant subsidies to wind and solar energies, thus exploding the solar bubble and leaving those who invested in solar energy (including those who saw it as an investment practically without risk for their retirements) with nothing.
374	13	· Africa Unlike other countries that have created their own problems, many African countries have fallen victims of carbon dioxide emissions reduction plans. Carbon dioxide emitting fuels have taken millions of people from poverty, but not in Africa, where some governments and environmental groups have worked with developed countries to try to "compensate" their own carbon dioxide emissions and divide the land in "carbon farms" and forest projects. In some cases, this has forced farmers to sign strict contracts for the use of land that excludes them from a more productive agriculture. Other programs have even expelled people from their homes to leave space to the Friends of CO2 forests. Basically, rich and developed nations have paid Africans to remain poor and help the nations developed feel better when emitting carbon dioxide.
374	15	With both expected and unexpected costs of climate change programs, patents worldwide, the United States should reject such economically reckless plans for environmental benefits, on the other hand, on the other hand, it is unappreciable from the reduction of dioxide emissions carbon. Someone always has to pay the invoice, whether companies, consumers, taxpayers or politically helpless. This is one of the reasons why it makes sense to let the market (that is, companies and their customers) make decisions about how our energy is obtained and how much it costs.
374	17	And another good reason is this: it does not matter how well intentional it is, when it comes to planning and ordering our energy options centrally, the Government does a better work spoiling the things that arranging them.
375	1	Zelenski "El Maligno"
375	3	There are people who when they do not like a person tries to discredit it at any price, even if it has to invent crazy issues that, already apparently, there is no one to create them.
375	5	This is what happens now with the president of Ukraine, Volodimir Zelenski and an alleged translation of his last name and name, in that order. In social networks we can find a capture of an alleged conversion of the Ukrainian to the Spanish that would result in "the evil one owns the world."
375	7	It is ensured that the phrase arises if the last name is split and then the name and placed in an internet translator in this way: "Zele", "NSKY", "Volody", "Myr".
375	9	If true, that it is not, since it is a bulos, Volodimir Zelenski would be "the evil" from the cradle and in general also his paternal family, at least. In addition, his parents would be fully in the garlic of demonizing him, since they would have bothered to complete their satanic circumstances with the appropriate name.
375	11	It is all false, in addition to a bullshit. Volodimir Zelenski does not translate into Spanish as "the evil owner of the world" under any logical circumstance. You can try to put the name in the Google translator or in whatever it is and leave it in the way it wants, that a translation will not appear in such a way. Moreover, it does not have a literal translation into Spanish, although you can be searched based on parts of the name.
375	13	This matter is seen on social networks, especially on Twitter, since this month of October, sometimes seasoned with phrase like "someone has seen this ?? ! It translates literally "the evil one owns the world."
375	15	As we see, the "blissful" Zelenski does not like those who are spreading this bulge, but manipulating a capture is very easy, and providing false arguments, too. Trying to convince the world of this, it seems that the same, because there are indeed dozens of people who have believed it and have made it their own.
375	17	Since Russia began the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the bulos that have served to volume Zelenski have been used, as we have been able to verify in Bulocracy.
375	19	His false gay past in New York has been exalted, he has been called a murderer to shoot in the Ukrainian Parliament, when it was an image of a film in which he participated in 2016, they have dressed him with the Nazi uniform of the SS and With a soccer shirt with the swastika on the back, or it has been said that he participated with his wife in a musical named Endless Love.
375	21	This now satanizing it directly is a new twist and puts on a very high ribbon for futures bulos on Zelenski, because finding something to attribute worse than being "the evil one" seems difficult.
376	1	Erdogan 'convinces' to Putin to resume the export of grain
376	3	- LIVE UCRANIA-RUSIA WAR: Last minute
376	5	- Russia war recruits Afghan soldiers for its invasion of Ukraine
376	7	The fear that Russia withdraw from the agreement for the safe circulation of agricultural products through the Black Sea was dissipated thanks to the decisive intervention of the president of Turkey. After days of intense contacts between Rece Tayyip Erdogan, de facto mediator between Ukrainians and Russians, and the main ones involved in the mechanism approved last July, the Kremlin has confirmed that it will resume its participation in the agreed device. The decision reduces risk to a grain price increase.
376	9	As explained by the Ministry of Defense of Russia through a statement, its government obtained the "necessary guarantees" of Ukraine of "not using the humanitarian corridor established by the agreement, and the Ukrainian ports designated for the export of agricultural assets, to launch Military operations against the Russian Federation. " The message also explained that Turkey, and an international organization not mentioned, helped start such commitments from Ukrainian President, Volodimir Zelenski.
376	11	Putin was quoted by Ragip Soyu, a renowned Turkish journalist, stating that "having Turkish neutrality in the conflict and capabilities of the Turkish grain processing industry", his country was not going to hinder the exports of grain, of which the Turks benefit singularly. For his part, Erdogan confirmed that, from the mid -afternoon on Wednesday, the merchants would circulate on the established route. He had agreed with Putin and Zelenski.
376	13	Last Sunday, after a massive attack with aerial and naval drones against the port of Sebastopol, Moscow declared that he suspended his participation in the agreement. According to it, Russian and Ukrainian officials must be present at an Istanbul -based inspection center. There are inspected ships that come out and enter the Black Sea, which surround a safe route. The objective is to guarantee the safety of the ships and that they do not transport weapons for Ukraine.
376	15	In the conversations that allowed to sign these pacts, the UN and Turkey played a preponderant role. Since the beginning of the invasion, Ankara, which has remained outside the wide front of sanctions approved by the West, has tried to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. Aware of how much he can lose in this war, and taking advantage of his proximity to both Russians and Ukrainians, the Erdogan government has even managed to bring together the foreign ministers of both countries.
376	17	His success as a mediator has been unequal. Although he has failed to stop the invasion, and political contacts between kyiv and Moscow are almost broken before the successive Russian massacres or the Ukrainian refusal to make territorial concessions, the agreement for the export of agricultural products has resulted, to date, a success. The contacts of the last days have also allowed the Turkish capacity to overcome a crisis that directly threatened the global food price.
376	19	The UN, the other relevant actor in this crisis, welcomed the reverse of Russia. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary General António Guterres, stressed that Guterres "remains involved with all the actors in the full implementation of the initiative and its renewal", scheduled for the end of this month. He also expressed his commitment to "eliminate obstacles to fertilizer exports and Russian foods", one of the Kremlin demands as a counterpart to his support for the pact.
376	21	But, in this war, as soon as a crisis is raised by the horizon. According to American intelligence sources, cited by The New York Times, Russian generals discussed the possibility of an attack using nuclear weapons of the so -called tactics. However, the White House spokesman John Kirby went out to clarify that "there are no signs that Russia is making preparations for such use."
376	23	In the same press conference, Kirby wanted to make it clear that his country "continues to monitor in the best possible way" Russia's movements, which this week ended the partial mobilization of Russian men announced last September. "We have made it clear from the beginning that Russia's comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons is deeply worrying, and that we take them very seriously," Kirby said.
376	25	In a statement published Wednesday afternoon, the Russian government also seemed to convey some calm around its military discussions. "We fully reaffirm our commitment to the Joint Declaration of the leaders of the five states of nuclear weapons on the prevention of nuclear war and avoid an arms race from January 3, 2022," said the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Russia.

377	7	- War Russia Bombardea Zaporiyia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, and is done with its control
377	9	The authorities of the Ukrainian Province of Barcov have denounced this Sunday the impact of projectiles launched by the Russian forces on the National Research Center of the Institute of Physics and Technology, where there is an experimental nuclear reactor.
377	11	"On March 6, the Russian army has triggered a rocket shuttle on the Institute of Physics and Technology in Jerkov where there is a nuclear research installation," said the subsidiary of Ukrainian secret services (SBU) in this town. In the place there are 37 nuclear fuel batteries, so "a large -scale ecological catastrophe" could be caused, alerts the SBU, so a criminal investigation has been opened for a crime of echocide in accordance with article 441 of the Code Code Ukrainian.
377	13	The SBU has stressed that it continues to collect information for its subsequent presentation in the Hague, headquarters of the International Court of Justice (CIJ) and the International Criminal Court (TPI).
377	15	The Oiea, "deeply" worried about Zaporiyia
377	17	The International Atomic Energy Agency (OIEA) expressed its "deep concern" on Sunday for the information that communication with the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporiyia had interrupted, the largest in Europe, which Russia took on Friday.
377	19	The OIEA, the United Nations Nations Agency for Nuclear Activity, declared in a statement that the Ukrainian government informed him that the direction of that central, located in southeast Ukraine, was under the orders of the Russian forces.
377	21	kyiv also said that the Russian military had cut some mobile networks and the Internet and that telephone lines, email and fax had stopped working.
377	23	According to the Ukrainian authorities, only mobile phone communications could be made, although of poor quality, said the OIEA.
377	25	"I am extremely concerned about the events that I was informed today," said the general director of the OIEA, Rafael Grossi. "To be able to exploit the plant with total security, the address and the personnel must be authorized to perform their tasks, vital, in stable conditions, without improper interference or external pressure."
377	27	In addition, the OIEA indicated that the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had explained that he could only communicate by email with the staff of the Ukrainian Central of Chernobil, which was taken by the Russian soldiers on February 24.
377	29	Apparently, employees can no longer make rotations on duty, so Grossi insisted on "the importance of workers to rest to perform their important tasks with total security."
377	31	Ukraine has four active nuclear power plants, which produce about half of the electricity consumed by the country, and several nuclear deposits such as Chernobil.
378	1	Ukraine advises Russia to invite Putin to a wedding
378	3	After having tripled in October the air attacks on Ukraine, Russia has been forced this week to reconsider its military strategy after Vladimir Putin has received the invitation to a wedding that will be held in kyiv within a month. The Kremlin suspects that the ceremony, which will force Putin to move to Ukraine so as not to look bad with the bride and groom, the Zelenski army has orchestrated.
378	5	"At the wedding we will have to go because they [the bride and groom] have no fault and also my wife would not accept any excuse because she always says that if they invite you to a wedding you have to go," Putin acknowledged this morning, without hiding their frustration. Russian intelligence services admit that "there is no way to prove" that the wedding is a farce, but it is clear that the invitation forces Russia to interrupt its offensive and puts in clear danger the integrity of Putin, forced to enter into enemy territory With his best galas.
378	7	The Russian leader says that "the worst is not to have to stop the war, but to decide the gift and organize the agenda." It also suspects that "the money we pay for the wedding coverage will be used to finance Ukrainian troops."
378	9	While protesting the "dirty play" of Ukraine, "that violates all the rules of a war confrontation," Russia grants that "not attending the wedding of Anastasiya and Davyd would be a dishonor and harmed the image of our country, transmitting weakness".
378	11	At the close of the edition, Volodimir Zenlenski still did not confirm whether he has also received the invitation, but sources of his surroundings promise that, to coincide with Putin at the ceremony, he would "keep the forms" because "the bride and groom do not have to pay the price of a war and is the most important day of their lives ».
379	1	The thaw leads governments to ask citizens to welcome glaciers in their homes
379	3	"In the mountains they can no longer be because they get rid." This clear about global warming experts, insisting that, in the last 20 years, glaciers have lost a total of 267 gigatons of ice every year.
