381	1	Great Reset: hunger, energy poverty and economic downturn is the price for the new order of things
381	3	How much are the peoples willing to be sacrificed for "the future of the liberal new world of things" that tends to be imposed as a new form of globalization?
381	5	The Biden government is trying to convince the whole planet that the support of the "liberal world order" is much more important than any short -term financial pain we are currently experiencing.
381	7	So are people willing to pay high natural gas prices for the visible future and suffer from a very serious economic downturn to put pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia?
381	9	And of course to impose a (non -existent) version of a monopoly post -war world.
381	11	Some citizens in the US and elsewhere in the world would be willing to do so, but most would not.
381	13	In the wrong direction
381	15	On Friday, July 1, 2022, there were evidence that the US economy is heading in the wrong direction much faster than most of the "experts" of the established media.
381	17	Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model currently predicts that economic growth for the second quarter of 2022 will be negative 2.1 %…
381	19	The GDPNOW model assessment to increase real GDP (seasonally adapted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2022 is -2.1 percent on 1 July, reduced from -1.0 percent to June 30.
381	21	Expenditure and investment
381	23	Also, according to the Manufacturing Ism on Business report from the Institute for Supply, the current records of increasing actual second -quarter personal consumption costs and the increase in real gross private domestic investments reduced from 1.7 % and -13.2 %, , at 0.8% and -15.2%, respectively.
381	25	We are already in recession
381	27	The US GDP growth rate was negative in the first trimester and if the GDP growth rate is again negative in the second quarter, it would mean that we are already in recession at the moment.
381	29	Negative developments in the job market - Zuckerberg's intervention
381	31	If it is confirmed later this month that we are already in recession, it will not be exactly a surprise, but the good news is that so far this new economic downturn is not so serious.
381	33	Unfortunately, we continue to see more signs that things will soon get worse.
381	35	The rate of redundancies is really starting to accelerate and this is especially true in the technology industry.
381	37	At this point, even Facebook is trying to reduce employment in its ranks…
381	39	In addition to freezing the recruitment, Mark Zuckerberg also noted that the company left vacancies and planning to remove staff who are unable to respond to specific efficiency indicators.
381	41	"Realistically speaking, there are probably a lot of people in the company that shouldn't be here," Zuckerberg said, adding, "part of my hope and just by raising the tension a bit is that I think some of you may decide that this A fundamental environment is not for you and that I accept this to you. ”
381	43	Consumer spending cuts even for food
381	45	In the meantime, citizens cut their consumer spending at a scary pace.
381	47	In fact, a recent survey discovered that 83 % of all Americans have "cut their personal expenses due to rising prices" ...
381	49	Provident Bank found that 83% of respondents reduced their personal expenses due to increased food prices and gasoline, with 23% saying that they had to make "drastic changes" in their costs for financial survival.
381	51	According to the results of the 600 adult survey, 10.5% of respondents rejected all non -basic markets and almost 72% said that at least some changes to personal travel habits.
381	53	Wall's worst semester since 1970
381	55	The first half of 2022 was the worst first half of the year for the S&P 500 since 1970 and the index has now sank into the territory of the Bear Market…
381	57	All of this came a day after the S&P 500 recorded a quarterly loss of more than 16% - its largest quarter decline since March 2020.
381	59	For the first semester, the wider market index fell 20.6% to its highest drop in the first half since 1970. It also fell to a bear market, declining more than 21% of the high record in early January .
381	61	is (?) Necessary - long -term match
381	63	The Biden government openly admits that greater economic pain is coming but we are told that it is necessary.
381	65	On Wednesday, June 29, 2022, CNN interviewed a key financial adviser to Joe Biden, Brian Deese, and what he said during this interview are heading around the world ...
381	67	CNN Victor Blackwell's presenter interviewed Deese on Thursday, June 30 and said that the Director of the National Intelligence Service Avril Haines said the war between Russia and Ukraine could be torn and confronted,
381	69	Blackwell said: "I think everyone understands why this is happening but is it viable?
381	71	What do you say to those families they say, listen, we don't have the luxury of paying $ 4.85 a gallon for months, if not years?
381	73	This is not viable'
381	75	Deese - who was previously a Blackrock executive - replied: "What we heard from the president (Biden) today concerned the stake.
381	77	This is about the future of the liberal world order and we must remain stable. "
381	79	They used to call it "new world order", but this phrase now has so many negative congestions that they decided to find something new.
381	81	Is the "Liberal World Order" even worse?
381	83	Why do you need it?
381	85	First of all, why do we need to have a "world order"?
381	87	Why can't we just try to do well with everyone instead of trying to impose our perverted values ​​all over the planet?
381	89	I really hope the US and Russia had just left Ukraine alone and allowed them to determine their fate.
381	91	The pawns and the chessboard
381	93	The US and Russia have been involved in a scary war for delegates (proxy war) and countless Ukrainians are sacrificed like pawns on a chessboard - we will see if others follow him.
381	95	If both sides continue to escalate this conflict, it could eventually bring us to the brink of nuclear war.
381	97	Many ruthlessly warn where all this nonsense will eventually lead us, but most of the world does not want to hear.
381	99	Unfortunately, many will simply continue to support "the devised truth" regardless of the consequences.
381	101	The first half of 2022 was full of surprises, but world events are expected to accelerate even more in the second half of this year.
3810	1	The rich prime minister appears to live life… wage
3810	3	Kyriakos and Mareva Mitsotakis mismatch with debt, luxury life, travel and increased deposits
3810	5	Is there any doubt about the luxurious life of both the prime ministerial couple Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Marevas Grabovovsky and the pre -empted members of the crowded government? They study their children in the most expensive schools in Athens. They then spend money on to study at the best private universities in the world. They live in spitals with a huge annual energy footprint (current and heating). They have immovable property that is stunned. Their lives in no case is characterized by temperance. Travel and inexperienced Long Weekends and three -day life have left a season, as well as the name of the "inexorable prime minister" to Mr Mitsotakis.
3810	7	But was it just that? They are briefly and no one is aware of the interest rate at which these loans are granted by the banks. They are, of course, the same persons who are able to get the banks to get the first residence of the "red" borrowers. They are the ones who are "calling" by photographic provisions of legal arrangements, the crimes of bankers even at the expense of the Greek economy.
3810	9	Nevertheless, the half cabinet, of course, with the country's prime minister, owes € 13 million and the big issue is that some of them have the same loan obligations as the previous year, operators. Their loans, but the banks do not chase them as they do with the "red" borrowers. They do not probably complain about loan conventions to make the whole amount demanded and to turn to the hundreds of real estate that all of them have, yes, shake their finger in society but giving luxurious borrowing life.
3810	11	On the other hand, there are elements that boast. It is the law that is not involved with morals. It is the way to "blur" the statements wherever you are. For Mr. Mitsotakis there is a loan from his sister given to him in 2018, amounting to 150,000 euros, and must repay it in 2035. Questions are reasonable. Does it come from where you were Alexandra Guarden's sister? Has a loan agreement be signed between individuals? Has the 3,6% paper gossip has been paid to the tax office (ie 5,400 euros)? It has been known since 1964, when the politicians have been introduced - despite the ERE long and long resistance - that it is not "where you were" but "what did you have". Even when in 2003, at the expense of the wealth of modernist PASOK executives, the law changed, few were substantially amended.
3810	13	But even so, even if you are where you are a typical process, "hares" arise. If one takes the statements and analyzes them, the horse of those declared arises. For example, Prime Minister Mr. Mitsotakis. He and his five -member family, who live in a fourth -floor apartment of 240 square meters, are called upon to live by spending 6,035 euros a month. When you have a cottage in Chania with staff. When you have another cottage in Tinos. When one child, Sofia, received a degree in 2019 and does not appear to work in 2020. When your other child, Constantine, in 2020 has no income, while the smallest Daphne studied at the Athens College. Then the bill does not come out, no matter how much your sister appears to lend you.
3810	15	The same is true of Vice President and Minister of Development AD. Georgiadis, who appears to live and his four -member family in a 450 sq.m. in Marousi, while his monthly incomes, if you deduct the obligations, as they arise from his wherever you are, exceeds 1,500 euros!
3810	17	For Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his wife Mareva, the word luxury accompanies every appearance. They are rich and want to show it. The issue is where the money comes from which they are giving this luxurious life. Is it from excessive lending? To avoid forgetting, the Mitsotakis couple owes the muscular amount of 1,295,928.89 euros, but appears at 2020 to have paid only € 24,425.85 to banks. If we turn it on a monthly basis - and remove the loan from his sister, amounting to 150,000 euros - then we can easily conclude that for loans totaling € 1,145 million the Mitsotakis - Grabovsky paid 2.0 euros! It is obvious that this is a eye and exposes the banks that lent them. They are the same institutions that take the first home home for a loan of 15,000 euros that increased it to 60,000 euros with interest and surcharges. They are the same banks with robbery rates. In the end it is Mr. Mitsotakis who instituted the new bankruptcy code at the expense of society and in favor of banks, funds and services.
3810	19	Missing' loan to Voltaire's house
3810	21	As if not all of this was enough, regarding the exorbitant loan obligations that the prime ministerial couple declares in the statement wherever you are, the loan is not included through which Voltaire's famous house was purchased. Specifically, in June 2006, the French company SCI Personal Ventures received a loan of 900,000 euros from Ge Money Bank Bank to buy - an additional 725,000 euros were given to Voltaire's home. No one knows who repays and to what extent the loan in question, since the prime ministerial couple does not report to the French company, despite the Greek company MGPG Investment Consulting IKE, which belongs to M. Grabovski and her brother George Papazis. which has acquired the overwhelming majority package of SCI Personal Ventures. All this while MGPG Investment Consulting IKE is a company that we do not know what assets it has, since the prime ministerial couple has not published its property.
3810	23	The account does not come out
3810	25	The questions are many, since if you read the statement wherever you are you end up with the conclusion that the account does not come out. It is given that the last statement of wherever you are referring to the use of 2020. There the Mitsotakis couple has a reduction in income compared to 2019 of € 29,844.53. That is, from € 146,693.76 in 2019, their income was reduced at 116,849.23 euros in 2020. Despite the reduction, the moms of the household managed to increase their deposits within a year by 156.004.68 euros. At 31.12.2020 they reported deposits totaling EUR 589,046.83, when on 31.12.2019 they had stated 433,042.05 euros. How did they do it?
3810	27	If we believe a prime minister who has not hesitated to file a false statement wherever you were - to hide Voltaire's house in Paris belonging to his wife - and according to what they say in the statement, this accounting alienation comes from a transfer of income - . Grambovsky - from previous years. It is noteworthy that a single income transfer from Société Générale to France brought to Mitsotakis' deposits of $ 177,305.43.
3810	29	It is obvious that the money being made as an annual income of EUR 72,423.3 - deducted of a lucrative € 24,425.85 they paid for their bank lending and another 20,000 euros in conservative estimation for taxes and ENFIA. So, based on its income, the five -member Mitsotakis family is called upon to live with 6,035 euros a month!
3810	31	With these money it must maintain the fourth floor apartment of 240 sq.m. In Lycabettus, to maintain the cottage next to the home of Christoforakos of Siemens in Tinos totaling a total of 471 sqm. Of course, the huge dimensional building with staff in Chania. Only the energy footprint of the house in Lycabettus (current and heating) costs, according to an energy inspector, the amount of € 20,000 per year - at least 12,000 euros for currents and at least € 8,000 for heating.
3810	33	Of course, there can be only three drunken housing and maintenance costs with staff in Athens, Tinos, Chania and 37 other properties. The Mitsotakis couple had to pay tuition for their young daughter at the Athens College of at least 8,640 euros, should maintain their son Constantine for his studies at Boston College, USA, the first half of the year (on 21 September 2020. ranked in order to serve his military service), while the greatest daughter of the family does not seem to work somewhere to have incomes to help her parents who have been suffocated in the statement of expense in the statement.
3810	35	    Mitsotaki - Grabowski for loans totaling € 1,145 million pays 2,035 euros monthly installment!
3810	37	    156.004.68 euros saved the prime ministerial couple in 2020, despite a reduction in income by 29,844.53 euros in relation to
3810	38	With 2019
3810	40	20
3810	41	    Euro annually costs, according to an energy inspector, the energy footprint of the couple's house in Lycabettus (current and heating)
3810	43	The costs of a luxurious life
3810	45	It is obvious in all of this that we have not included the family living expenses of a five -member family (clothing, footwear, food, electricity, water, telephony and internet accounts). Nor, of course, the expensive entertainment of all these people, who are obvious - and do not hesitate to show it - that they are living a luxurious life.
3810	47	So how do they manage to survive and maintain their meager - always in relation to what they themselves involve in their statements - incomes? Currently and unhappy by banks, it is one face of the dark side of the moon. But when the immense darkness of bank loans fails to balance things, there is relatives to lend Mr. Mitsotakis. When this version is exhausted, then it is easy to transport income from the past through the increase in bank deposits. Did these money be before in the door that the family proves to be in Alpha Bank? Why didn't the previous years appear and have come to increase the amount of bank deposits from 2019 to 2020 while we had an income reduction? Questions that, as in the case of Adonis Georgiadis, will remain unanswered at the expense of this government's unclear.
3811	1	For everything ... the war is not to blame
3811	3	The ND government has found the solution "by any disease and any shit". The war in Ukraine is to blame for everything.
3811	5	Of course, to be fair, at least, at least the various diseases and viruses have not attributed them to the war, but by October tourists will leave and new pandemics will appear, no one knows. As far as the "shit" is concerned, we will look at it immediately.
3811	7	To raise gasoline prices, gas, etc. our war is to blame. But increases in energy invoices had begun since last August that there was no suspicion of war at that time. So not the gentlemen of the ND, the war on increases in energy is not to blame.
3811	9	It is your obsessive attachment to "green growth", the rushing closure of lignite mines, the precise energy from multinational wind turbines, your fear of non -research and utilization of national energy resources. It is also to blame that you do not put a ceiling on the prices and allow companies to speculate unhappy.
3811	11	For increases in basic products prices and for any shortcomings, the war that has caused an increase in electricity is to blame. But as early as May 2021, with the end of the big quarantine, the prices on the shelves had taken the uphill. We had war then? No, of course, but we had and have the policy that supports the big chains, which favors the big ones at the expense of small businesses.
3811	13	We have the speculation left uncontrollable, we have the closure of the small shops that owe hundreds of euros and the adjustments to the big ones that owe thousands. As for the shortcomings in wheat, for example, the policies that reduced agricultural production and made the country from an export of agricultural products, an importer of everything.
3811	15	But also about Turkey's challenges we heard that the war and the geopolitical rearrangements it brought. As if we had no violations before the war, we had no incendiary rhetoric and "writing" all international conditions. Not the gentlemen of the ND, for the provocation of the Turks you and your predecessors are responsible for you. Those of you who are buying weapons systems (rightly) but are defended with applause in the Congress and whispering.
3811	17	In the end you will tell us that the war is to blame for crime and illegal immigration. Why not hear that too? But not the gentlemen of the ND, the impunity of the law is to blame for the crime, the stroke of the "vulnerable" groups, the lack of policing. For illegal immigration, the policies of the open borders, the division of political asylum, the gift of citizenship through .. exams you first applied.
3811	19	So leave the fairy tales. The war is not to blame but your liberal economic policies, your dependence on foreign power centers, your scared diplomacy and the copying of the left of a social mechanical Soviet -style.
3811	21	Opposite all of this, the Greek National Party proposes the return to the national economy, the policy of self -sufficiency in basic products, energy independence through the extraction of national lignite and natural gas deposits. Proposes an independent policy with strong national defense. It proposes a social policy without ENFIA types, sophistication tax and adjustment clauses. It proposes the application of laws to everyone and the closure of the border to uncontrolled immigration.
3811	23	Be sure that in the next elections, whenever they do, the people will remember both the "disease" but also punish the "mollusk".
3812	1	Greek Watergate crushes Mitsotakis
3812	3	The prime minister made his own great scandal with journalists, political opponents and intra -party "enemies", whose revelation is just beginning.
3812	5	The career of an internationally renowned cited by Kyriakos Mitsotakis seems to be confirmed while at the same time becoming a writer of a black page for modern Greek history. The prime minister is pursuing a career as a Greek Nixon and creates his own watergate with journalists, political opponents, but - according to information - and intra -party opponents.
3812	7	Political and journalistic criticism (pioneering Documento) that placed the current Prime Minister as the head of a regime was confirmed by him by removing Gregory Dimitriadis' secret and nephews from the post of Prime Minister and Prime Minister and Panagiotis . Mitsotakis ratified what journalistic research has revealed by assumption of guilt, preceding a period with a strong attempt to deceive public opinion. In addition to the "private" surveillance systems, the EYP was monitoring PASOK President Nikos Androulakis, journalist Thanassis Koukakis and others who will soon be revealed.
3812	9	The government, with the responsibility and orders of the Prime Minister himself, served as a paramilitary sect aimed at killing political opponents. He used justice for this with the Novartis case and the EYP. Mr. Mitsotakis cannot be prevented that the removal of his two representatives, Dimitriadis and Kontoleon, was made for personal reasons, nor can he rescue those who have been criminal, as he usually does a virtual reality through the media. The information broadcast on Friday night and wants the country not to take the installment of the European Union recovery fund because it does not comply with the rules of law is not independent of developments with surveillance. The Maximus Palace is no longer only an orphan after political euthanasia to Gr. Dimitriadis, but also on the brink of collapse.
3812	11	At the expense of the rapid developments it is doubtful whether Mitsotakis chooses to represent the prime minister. It is no longer unlikely that Mr Mitsotakis will go to the Thessaloniki International Exhibition with an announcement of early elections to prevent - as he may believe - the complete collapse.
3812	13	The background with Androulakis watching
3812	15	PASOK President N. Androulakis' telephone control of the European Parliament has shown that an attempt had been made to install Predator monitoring software. Androulakis appeared quite conservative after revealing the attempt to insult his phone. He did not lift the tones politically and behaved too modestly, to the extent that there were comments within PASOK itself that he does not want to disrupt the possible future cooperation with the ND. But it seems that reading was not so political. N. Androulakis was afraid, as some of his associates were told, that if he was under surveillance, then there is personal information about him who would not want to get public. It is noteworthy that PASOK official and well -known lawyer Costas Daltas in a post on Facebook when asked why they were watching Androulakis replies "to blackmail him".
3812	17	The revelation of his monitoring case by the EYP was rather a matter of luck. Androulakis asked the ADAE and the Supreme Court Public Prosecutor to investigate his attempt to monitor him with the predator. But when the ADAE received the complaint one of the auditors wondered if it was legal monitoring, even collecting irony from his colleagues because he was a party president. In the formal scrutiny, however, it was found that there was a prosecution order in the EYP for monitoring N. Androulakis. That is to say, there was an identical process with the one that followed by journalist Th. Koukakis. At first attempted monitoring with the predator and then officially took over. The disclosure of the follow -up by the EYP has shaped new data, which led to developments. A political one -way political was created.
3812	19	Mitsotakis with his back on the wall
3812	21	From the early days of the revelations about the journalist Th. Government spokesman Yiannis Economou spoke of a private monitoring system that was unknown to the government. The journalist, however, was clear that in addition to monitoring software he knew that there was also a consensus of the EYP. Neither the government provided answers nor the media thought there was a problem. The situation changed dramatically when EYP Commander P. Kontoleon, examining the matter in the House of Institutions and Transparency Committee, admitted that Koukakis was in legal monitoring because they had requested foreign intelligence services.
3812	23	The bomb assumption that Documento had made public, having information from the Commission immediately exposed the prime minister as the responsibility of the EYP. However, Maximus Mansion leaked that Kontoleon's reports were about another thing and not Koukaki monitoring. The leaks even became so rushed and stiff that four sites of the "first theme", Sky, iefimerida and Thetoc, published the same text as if they had been responded to the same journalist.
3812	25	Mitsotakis continued to be in his communication paradise and believed that the depreciation of damage is a matter of time and media excellence. Suddenly, however, the revelation of Androulakis' watching by the EYP came. Even for systemic media, proven monitoring of PASOK leader is not something they can and want to overtake.
3812	27	The two associates' dismissals
3812	29	The removal of Gr. Dimitriadis and Fr. They are movements of "salvation" and despair, but it is the result of many and varied pressures. First of all, the dismissals cannot save Mitsotakis.
3812	31	The first day after the election (he did not do well to swear) he changed the law to take control of the EYP. He also changed the provisions for the EYP commander in order to appoint Kontoleon, who had neither the nouns nor the formal qualifications. When the journalist Th. Koukakis was found, he changed the law again, so that he could not be aware of the reasons for his monitoring as predicted.
3812	33	Consequently, Mitsotakis could not accuse anyone of the EYP and the surveillance, since in various ways he was linked to the country's secret services, not even on national security issues but for dealing with the "internal enemy".
3812	35	The conversion of Gr. Dimitriadis overnight by a trustee of the family and personal policy Mitsotakis into a person who gathers (and will continue to gather) all the fire relates to Mitsotakis' belief that this will be the case for those who have targeted him. In revelations about the surveillance, a large group of independent journalists from several media participate. Mitsotakis cannot therefore resort to the usual tactic of direct slander as he did with Documento.
3812	37	He believes that the motive of the revelations are the interests of businessmen with whom he was not aligned through Dimitriadis. The truth is that wide circles of ND people, including businessmen, communicators and publishers, had open accounts with the prime ministerial nephew.
3812	39	Dimitriadis also gathered the discomfort of ministers and party mechanism (at some point in Mareva Grabowski) about the special relationship with Mitsotakis. Dimitriadis 'choices left many bridegroom, but always with Mitsotakis' commands. For a year now, Dimitriadis was thrown out of disturbing and showing it, even commenting that it favors specific and strange interests. It was the "step" of Marinakis who had called him a man under every stone you lift when it comes to "jobs".
3812	41	The case of surveillance and his relationship with companies associated with the alleged protagonists of private bedbugs made Dimitriadis vulnerable and even more Mitsotakis. In the coming period many will remember a lot about Dimitriadis' strange relationships, while at the same time, whether they want it or not, they will pave the way for Mitsotakis himself.
3812	43	In the coming days, according to information from Maximou, there will be an attempt to show the revelations as well as the journalists who made them the result of the action of foreign intelligence services that decided to hit Mitsotakis because he did not supply their own weapons systems. Such profile murder operations have been done in the past.
3812	45	What Mr Mitsotakis does not understand is that this is not a temporary snowfall, but a avalanche that will drag him.
3812	47	The surveillance is the top of a large iceberg. At its base are business agreements, privatizations, funds transactions, all with the responsibility of Dimitriadis and the Mitsotakis commands. The revelations are now beginning. And it seems, and the fall. As it turned out in Nixon's watergate, the shift of responsibility to others did not save him. Accelerated the defeat.
3813	1	They destroyed the economy and now ... they whistle indifferently
3813	3	Incredible is the boldness of Kyriakos Mitsotakis' government officials, as after two years they destroyed the Greek economy and terrorized the citizens with the pandemic, now they say ... that they were wrong in the way the dead are recording!
3813	5	Specifically, Health Minister Thanos Plevris, speaking to the Open, has clarified in a characteristic obsessive style that the measure of suspension of healthcare before 31/12 would not be re -examined the death system during the pandemic.
3813	7	He reiterated what he had already admitted several times that the Greek Health Authorities declare "death of Covid" even someone who died for another cause, but had ... the misfortune to find a positive on the coronovation!
3813	9	But what has raised quite a bit is his disclosure about changes in the death of deaths since next week.
3813	11	"From now on to the deaths we declare we will refer to how many of them are the cause of Covid and how many were for another reason but these people had covid. So we did not have an increase in deaths because the majority of deaths since May are combined with incidents that are for any reason but combined with Covid. "
3813	12	Announces new vaccines
3813	14	While citizens live a regularity, as most measures for Koronovio have been abolished, Health Minister Thanos Plevris argues that vaccines are coming from contamination and therefore ... It is quite likely to stand for the return of certificates.
3813	16	As Mr Plevris said, "At the moment the vaccines we have protected from severe disease and not from infection and therefore there is a recommendation for over 60 years and vulnerable groups to be vaccinated now"
3813	18	"PFIZER and MODERNA are running vaccines that will also protect from the disease with the Mutation of Omikron to obtain approval in August, while for the subordinates of Olkron we are waiting for these vaccines at the end of the year," the health minister added.
3813	20	He noted on the duration of the vaccines that "we do not know if it will be one -dimensional or repeat such as the flu, we know that the direction of companies is to design vaccines that will catch the disease" while for the planning of the Ministry of Health he said that "it is" Transfer orders after September because the up -to -date vaccines are expected. "
3813	22	Thanos Plevris also explained that "there is no recommendation for vaccination in the wider population. If this will happen, it will be done since September based on scientific data. The ECDC and the competent bodies will recommend whether general vaccination or targeted population groups should be performed. "
3813	24	On the course of Coronovirus, the Minister of Health said that "we are currently in the decline in the Coronovirus wave. This wave has the peculiarity that it was about hospitalizations in simple beds and therefore there was no pressure on the ICU. "
3813	26	Asked, after all, about the possibility of new measures in the fall, he said that "the will of most states is that we are in the logic that we coexist with the pandemic and thus operate more with recommendations and culture of protection rather than compulsory. We do not have this in mind but if needed it will be done but with mild features such as using mask. "
3814	1	We lost the train to Mitsotaki - Karamanlis. Literally and figuratively
3814	3	Mitsotakis - Karamanlis's barren term could not affect society and the country more negatively. And the consequences of the political degradation of a dynamic means of transport in the economy and the development of Greece are indisputable.
3814	5	Large cities, such as Xanthi, Komotini and Alexandroupolis, have been watching a train for three years.
3814	7	The cancellations of the routes succeed each other and the passengers eventually move by bus and delays.
3814	9	The rail network collapses, uninvited, derailments are being made daily and projects, such as telecommunications in Athens - Corinth and the underground in Patras, which we had begun as a government, are in the air.
3814	11	The situation imposed on the train, his employees and the passenger public by Mitsotakis and Karamanlis is tragic. The incidents of the last days confirm this.
3814	13	The immobilization of TRAINOSE's "white arrow" near Dekelia, which cut Greece in two and paralyzed the routes, and the derailment of the train outside Tithorea, who highlights the responsibilities of K. Karamanlis and OSE in -ter ' Obstacles- Operation of the rail network are not unfortunate incidents.
3814	15	Mr Karamanlis insists he has launched projects of 3.3 billion euros in the field. It repeats it monotonously, although these projects have not secured funding on the one hand, on the other hand they should have been announced since 2019.
3814	17	The Mitsotakis government systematically underestimates the railway. And the interests of the State are grossly violated.
3814	19	It is noteworthy that, while signing Karamanlis, the Ministry of Cooperation Memorandum - TRAINOSE envisaged investments of € 780m from the company, the amount included in the contract, which recently came to the House, did not exceed € 160m. Over 600 million euros in investment liabilities, therefore, became air.
3814	21	And, of course, we are talking about a contract that reduces half the barren routes of TRAINOSE but subsidizes it for everything, which integrates in the barren profitable routes, such as Athens - Thessaloniki, which provides for the purchase of expensive trains by the State, so that then To rent the private company, which has been subsidized for investment.
3814	23	Mitsotakis - Karamanlis's barren term could not affect society and the country more negatively. And the consequences of the political degradation of a dynamic means of transport in the economy and the development of Greece are indisputable.
3814	25	For days we lost the train. Literally and figuratively.
3815	1	Just hypocrites
3815	3	So the ND government discovered Kouros. And the television screens were filled with the glittering smile of this bright creature. As a while ago, they discovered Saidu. Who, as an excellent, managed - with the help of his teachers, classmates and classmates - to accept his request and not deported. Something that is probably (and happy) happen - due to the publicity of his case, as the mobilization of local bodies to his face came just days after the Saidu case - and with Vafing Sassé, the student from Guinea who He lives in Samos, whose application for asylum has already been rejected twice.
3815	5	And the tenants of the Maximus Grand try to convince us that they are happy with their joy. Or, even worse, they are trying to exploit the personal success of these young children by incorporating it - even if they don't say it openly - into a context of state care and care that favors such successes! As if they are not the same children who have lived in the stake in the inhumane "host centers". As if they are not the same children waiting for their papers to legalize their own existence in the country. As if they are not the same children, who for the rulers - and their far -right offspring - are the "poachers", the "invaders", those who "do not fit".
3815	7	Let's not laugh. Kyriakos Mitsotakis does the need for philanthropy and congratulates the student who arrived with a plastic boat in Lesvos. The works and days of his government, his stance on constant complaints of illegal re -re -resorcisions in Evros, the micro -political use of refugee/migration as a tool in the confrontation with SYRIZA, are anything but advocate the sincerity of his intentions.
3815	9	The ND government is cramped. International media reports are increasing (Guardian, Le Monde, Lighthouse Reports, Report Munchen, Spiegel) with creepy details and representations that prove pushbacks in Evros. The International Press (there are relevant photos and three -dimensional videos) for lucky detention facilities and for information that refugees and immigrants hostage - better - better - to make these renewals on behalf of the Greek state, in return, after three months hard coercion, take the necessary papers and be able to go to another country. Information that, if not applicable, must be immediately and documented by the ND government, and not through the well -known regular slander of those who dare to report bad texts. Or through general answers, like those given by the responsible Minister of Migration N. Mitarakis to the Libe Committee of the European Parliament, arguing that "the Greek authorities respond to all rescue demands and never exercise violence against people seeking asylum".
3815	11	"All refugees can join. It is enough to be given the opportunity, ”were the first words of 19 -year -old Kouros, as soon as his success became known. And in his smiling face, he reflects the will, the stubbornness, the possibilities for a better life that all children are entitled to, all people looking for a better luck. The power of solidarity and inclusion is confirmed, and the unexplained screams of intolerance, racism and xenophobia disappear deafening.
3815	13	No, the ND government, and personally Kyriakos Mitsotakis, are not entitled to any share of the success of Kouros Dourmohamadi Bagi. Whatever photos they take with him, no matter how much Maximus' communicators bomb channels, newspapers and sites with the plans of the ... inclusive prime minister with the 19 -year -old Iranian. Why, how do you deny reality? Xenophobic statements of top ministers in his government still sound in our ears. Yesterday we remember shameful scenes with school occupations and "indignant" parents preventing their children from coexisting with refugees. To date, the central administration, representatives of the local government who make life unaware of refugees and immigrants, has been caressing, making it difficult for their creative and equitable integration into local communities.
3815	15	No, Mr. Prime Minister. Nothing corresponds to you from the glow of Kouros. Whatever he succeeded, he succeeded in your deterrent policies. You, with Greece of Solidarity and Offer, neither had nor have anything to do with. To refresh your memory a little? "If the Syrians want refugees and immigrants, take them home." Careers were built on this phrase.
3816	1	Prespa and Turkoeegean not compromised
3816	3	Prespa and Turkoeegean not compromised
3816	5	We have now learned A. Tsipras. He says everything trying to satisfy everyone. This is known to create more problems than he is trying to solve. Balance profit/loss is negative from this alien -Greek policy.
3816	7	It is well known that the Radical Left that the Aegean has no borders, that the flag is a piece of cloth, that we will risk not spending money on defense and many more related transnational clichés. The highlight of all this is the Prespa Agreement.
3816	9	Ten years ago, SYRIZA youth demonstrations had been preceded by the complex name, within the city of Skopje. In order to lift the misunderstanding, let me clarify that the youth demanded this state to be called "Macedonia" without any determination. So well!
3816	11	Today, A. Tsipras is complaining that the government was taken aback by the "Turkish -Eegean" case. How serious this case is will be. Whether there were omissions and that will be seen. Whether Turkey is entitled to use, for advertising reasons, of the word "Aegean" depends on how everyone sees it.
3816	13	But the last one who has the right to "get" from the right to the government, on the issue, is A. Tsipras. The government in which he was prime minister has a burdensome past.
3816	15	After all, a bilingualism was observed within SYRIZA. Mr. Xydakis considered Turkey, which has thousands of kilometers of coastline in the Aegean, to make use of this word. The left tendency whistles indifferently and A. Tsipras appeared as a super-patriot.
3816	17	Indeed, he said that if he were prime minister and what happened in Madrid and Turkoeegean, he would come to Greece on foot. Opposition of football doors.
3816	19	Of course, it happens that 57% of Greek citizens disagree with him as they approve the Greek government's handling of foreign policy issues. Particularly high, but absolutely justified by the facts.
3816	21	Obviously, A. Tsipras should always invent something to oppose the government. He had discovered that the prime minister in his speech in Congress did not name Turkey and had accused him of it. Had to say something to reduce a national success. After just a day Erdogan, in a furious state, attacked Kyriakos Mitsotakis for this speech. A. Tsipras didn't read something well.
3816	23	A politician with the presumption of seriousness is trying to build and maintain his profile. Only so will gain credibility. When one, for reasons of opposition tactics, goes to a right-hand left, like Orestes Makri in the film "The Methistas", then no one takes him seriously. This is what A. Tsipras has suffered. When you have signed the Prespa, you should not bother the "Turkoiye".
3817	1	Tsipras: The attack on the public university has a basic vehicle to abolish democratic structures and convert it into a private company
3817	3	"Everyone disagrees with the bill on higher education. Senate, Rector's Council, Teachers' Associations, students, 1000 foreign scientists and 1000 academics from all over Greece are signing letters for his withdrawal, only Mr Mitsotakis and Mrs Kerameos agree " , to restore self -government, to double resources and human resources, ”he promised.
3817	5	"Attempted on the public university that has as its main vehicle the abolition of its democratic structures and the mutation of the academic and representative university at a university that resembles a private company," he said, noting that the above is "at a time when accuracy is accuracy. The biggest issue that concerns households and businesses, in a period of intense geopolitical crises and tensions in the region, at a time when it is a common secret that Mr Mitsotakis is looking for the election date immediately after the end of summer. "
3817	7	According to Al. Tsipras, the prime minister "comes to speed up the electoral process not because he responds to the request we have put in for six months, but because he is facing the large accumulated impasses that his policy has created and enlarged" as "in '93 and offside is trying to set up a panel of overall degradation and change of rules governing the public university ", while describing" suspicious and the fact that it is once again attempting a structural change in the context of the operation of the Public University without the minimum consultation. With its officials. "
3818	1	Dimitris Koufontina, I was born November 17th
3818	3	by Constantine Pouli
3818	5	We could divide into two categories the views on political violence: one can believe (with various variations) that the state should possess the "monopoly on the legal use of physical violence", so it considers terrorism a police problem and is not interested in For what I will expose below. This is the case in the case of a journalist who wrote that it was a struggle between democracy and its enemies and continued using a quote by Margaret Thatcher: "Crime is not political. It's a crime, a crime. " Her support for Pinochet was not sufficient for the journalist to avoid the correlation, nor that Thatcher had called a terrorist Nelson Mandela. We can, however, say that the separation of camps into democrats and terrorists is rather simplistic. American examples, old and younger, are common places of the discussion.
3818	7	The second approach claims that there is a built -in violence into existing sovereignty relationships, so the question is whether, when, how and under what conditions do the dominant will be able to resort to violence to overturn these relationships of sovereignty (in this case "terrorism" It is called the "guerrilla city" by its devotees). Koufontina's book adapts a multitude of relative arguments to the Greek reality and the action of 17N. One that is common arguments of defending the armed struggle, I will try to get his words in cash and see what in my opinion he can withstand criticism and what is not ..
3818	9	The sacredness of human life
3818	11	Our first reaction to terrorism is usually the moral aversion caused by the removal of human life. But because moral aversion is a very fluid and subjective reality (slavery did not cause any moral aversion for centuries), we must insist on content. The implicit argument is the non -negotiable value of human life, in essence its sacredness. But the value of life is neither non -negotiable nor sacred: not only revolutionary rhetoric and ethics, but still current morality and together our criminal law bargain, with exceptions. The (fair) war and the (legal) defense are some of them. Historically, although all the societies we know do not omit a ban on the abstraction of human life, this rule is very rarely unnecessary. Ancient Greece excluded slaves and disabled children, road robber or someone attacking at night, someone who is arrested to commit adultery with his wife's wife and so on, and the truth is that if Christianity begins the universal ban on her Removal of human life, this ban remained a complex weight, even there. If the value of life is not absolute, that is, if no one subscribes to absolute pacifism, then we must bother to define what the conditions under which the removal of human life would seem to be incorrect or morally unjustified and which is not . The condition of defense use of violence does not solve the problem, because, as it has been said, defense and attack are relevant, not absolute situations, that is to say, the political interpretation of the competing parties.
3818	13	The responsibility of omissions and work accidents
3818	15	Dimitris Koufontina claims that 17N was killing murderers, describing the accidents repeatedly as murders of bosses against their employees, what Renato Kourtsio called "white murders". It refers to the Angelopoulou family and considers the steelmaker marked by the forty -five dead and hundreds of jackets (276) • claims that Greece holds "one of the highest positions worldwide, with third world murder rates called" 280 " (which by the way is not statistically confirmed). In Mandamochoria, he says they died, "murdered, more right", one hundred and ten miners only in the 1970s, by reduced protection measures, "not to reduce the minimal surplus" (295); "Crete Si" from the flammable materials and killed two other workers in February 1990 • "In the twenty -two years of 17N, factories and floating coffins of wealth murdered more than 3,500 workers. Only in the explosion of the Corinthian Pipelines SA of the BIOHALKO Group, we had six dead and three injured. Cause; The lack of a staunch component (non -return valves) in the bottles of oxygen. They had estimated that the cost of the fines would be less than the valve placement ”(365).
3818	17	The argument has been overwhelmed as non -existent, but this is not certain. The relevant literature on the responsibility of omissions is concentrated in the books of John Harris and Jonathan Glover and is summed up that when one lets know knowing a murder without stopping him, while he knows and can, he is responsible. If it also benefits from this death, as is clearly the case in the case of improper security measures, liability increases accordingly. The argument for accidents at work already exists in Marx and Engels, and Harris is of course recovered. Copies an excerpt from the state of the working class to England:
3818	19	When one person causes such a damage to another that has consistently death, we call this homicide; if the perpetrator knows before that his energy will cause death, we call his energy murder. But when society condemns hundreds of thousands of proletarians to a situation that are necessarily exposed to an early and abnormal death, in a death as violent as the death of a spat other living conditions, such as being impossible to survive; when they forces them with the powerful hand of the law to remain in this situation until death is followed, which is also the inevitable consequence • When they know very well that these thousands Beings will become victims of these conditions of existence and yet lets them exist, then they are just a murder, just like the one committed by a person, except that here is more disguised, more fraudulent, a murder against which no one can defend, which does not look like murder, because we do not see the killer, because the murderer is the whole world and no one, because death The victim seems natural, and because the sin is less committed to an analogous energy and more than omission.
3818	21	The fact that accidents at work are not perceived in common consciousness as murderous moral offenses is simply that our moral code is biased, it is to justify specific groups. That is to say, it seems reasonable to us ("natural law", as Marx used to say) to kill workers in the Olympic projects because of the working conditions, is due to the fact that the crimes of prominent and powerful financial people are more easily forgiven, as long as they buy a football team and a football team and /or a media.
3818	23	The question, however, is not if there is any truth in the basic argument, but whether this truth justifies the murder. The principle of "responsibility by omission" has been used in the philosophical debate on terrorism and it has been noted that if we can agree that there is such a responsibility, the question is that it should be determined how much it is and what exactly it means to "know" Act, when the degree of our involvement in an act that "let's happen" will be completely critical, if so it is to be decided that someone must die for this reason! My point is that this argument very well turns our attention to moral sins that escape the lens of our ethics, simply because current ethics is much more friendly to the powerful and to the citizens who enjoy the crime products of the crimes against other peoples (such as when the friendly American citizen enjoys cheap fuel for his car). But if the factory owner is responsible, will the security officer be responsible? His assistant? His wife, assuming she is discussing the problems with her? And assuming one of them proposed a security measure and was not accepted? How much did he have to insist? None of these calculations can go into the weighs by the act of imposing death penalty by armed revenge. Consequently, this argument is politically important to the extent that it turns our attention to the responsibilities of white collar criminals or well -to -do western crime of crime products of Forte whose factories in Latin America have been tortured, and have the audacity to be tortured. They also serve the rest of the world for human rights, that is, to those who with their omissions support the murder without dirty their own hands. Cannot lead to a moral justification of the death penalty. I totally agree with Glover's wording that "the existence of wars, poverty and many of the suffering of destroying or deteriorating people's lives is due to extensive indifference, not only in motivation of tangible volunteer." So we can agree. The next step is unjustified. After all, it remains a mystery in my eyes how to become leftists who are frustrated in the face of the defense of the death penalty, citing humanitarian arguments, to accept the execution. Yes, the difference is that it is a penalty imposed by the state, but I do not think that the drug dealer or the serial slaughter/rapist are more sympathetic than a factory manager.
3818	25	The institutional solution to our problems, in post -political Greece
3818	27	The second argument relates to the existence of an institutional solution of our complaints, which makes the armed action incomprehensible and irrational. In short, if the law protects us, there is no reason and space for unscrupulous revenge. If we understand the perpetrator who would get Hitler or Papadopoulos out of the middle, the same is not the case with a democratically elected government, because one would just say, there are other means. Voting and appealing to justice.
3818	29	We return to Koufontina. He talks about the desire to punish the torturers of the junta, who the state acquitted in trials, where the torturers had the audacity to adhere to their victims, with the "provocative impunity by the" European "and" Ethnarch " of the junta ”(173). "When Theophilogiannakos and his other minions were tried in the EAT/ESA, the torturers were gone by their victims who were depositing the signs of beastly violence. Alekos Panagoulis rightly declares in court: "Only the rendering of justice can impede self -judge" "(174). Mallios denies the court that eight torturers who are being tried with him, including Babalis (181), are being acquitted. It is repeated that if the state will not punish, they will do so. When Koufontina says that the phrase "the precedent of the impunity of dossier will not repeat" (182) marked him, obviously this means that a source of his own violence thinks it is the reluctance of the state to punish the criminals that are useful to him. The question is: If justice is not identified with legitimacy, it still applies that in the context of parliamentary democracy, solutions should always be institutional? Let's convey the debate to today's era.
3818	31	The criticism of whether we are legalized in the conditions of parliamentary democracy to talk about a "junta", adapted to more modern data, has been addressed by G. Kalioris to F. Terzakis. (See my own texts here and here) It is said there that the impatience of the "junta" characterization of a modern democracy highlights that one must have known the true junta in order to be able to appreciate the difference. It refers to the persecutions in Russia, Turkey and Iran, to make the extent of exaggeration in Terzakis' rhetoric.
3818	33	If it is worse, the answer is that there are much worse, and in this respect it is always comforting to see that the situation is much better than Turkey or Iran. But when Kalioris says that in today's Greece no one is prosecuted for his ideas, he is not right. There are cases of anarchists like Theophilus or Sakka who have made people aware of their partners, precisely because their persecutions were considered political bias and legally. The same is when the administrator of a satirical website for Elder Paisios was drawn to the courts. After all, political coverage of tortures made to anti -fascist protesters and complete police nonsense in relation to the violence practiced by immigrants, documented with a number of reports of international organizations, show that our country is not Iran or Turkey, but I do not know if I do not know if It is enough for us. When one sees the minister cutting the journalist's broadcast who asked what eventually that lawsuit in Guardian, he cannot maintain any faith in the institutions, and this is fatal weakening arguments in favor of the institutional absorption of protest and leads potentially. , whether we "condemn violence" or not. The level of such a criticism is not to justify armed violence. But it is understood that what Kalioris politely calls "weaknesses of our democracy" means crushed lives, much heavier than the average Kathimerini reader can imagine, which is more shocked by graffiti and copying at the university than by university than by Police barbarism. In short, Koufontina's argument is in principle correct: Philology about the monopoly of legal violence makes sense to the extent that this violence is bound by legality.
3818	35	Do we live today in conditions where state violence is not bound by legality, to the extent that the appeal is justified in the armed answer? No. My concern, however To anyone who tells us that he considers the appeal to it bitter joke.
3818	37	Tactic
3818	39	In front of lack of contact with the working class,
3818	41	Nitroglycerin replaced the mass movement.
3818	43	No. Meinhov
3818	45	The decisive issue of efficiency, which returns to the debate on terrorism, was already raised by Clausevic. It is the inability to root the goals of the struggle in the popular masses, which forever prevents the dream from fulfilling the dream that the opponent (the government) eventually collapses under the insistence of the attacks. Koufontina returns to the loss of contact with the masses, and is probably the only point for which a self -criticism is formulated. 17N would combine armed and mass action (73), the armed movement would be the lead of the movement (116), a continuation of EAM (119). He mentions the political disagreements and conflicts that took place within the organization, saying that he believed that "17N should transform the stream of sympathy it has given up and will create with its action into real material power • that it needs a" front "that is needed. It will capitalize on the fruits of the armed propaganda of "back", the armed mechanism; that one part of the (single) political action is a prerequisite for the success and development of the other "(212). Whenever he returns to this issue by saying that the organization "neglected its political role" (269), downgraded communication with the popular movement (220) and could not become a detonator of the class struggle (257, see and 385, 398, 471, 473, 474), stumbles on the same problem. He considers, in a nutshell, as a bad manipulation, which is the fundamental and historically impeccable impasse of terrorism. The debate in Italy sums up at the level of historical experience the theoretical wording of Clausevic (and many others). In the collection of texts published in Greek under the general title of the guerrilla's self -criticism, there is a reflection on the alienation of the rebels from the mass movement, which is essentially a rupee from the deadlock that had already snapped with the first time it was implemented on an ambitious scale. Act, with the assassination of Tsar Alexander in Russia. The people mourned the Tsar, betraying the dreams of the revolutionaries who thought this would trigger a generalized revolution against the Tsarist regime. The impasse that Koufontina was facing as if it were a bad handling that could have avoided if the balances and dialogue inside the organization had otherwise shaped, is simply the political limit of terrorism. The path from political vision to increasingly enclosed introversion, in the militaristic organization that alienates the world and confirms the consciousness of many the necessary embrace of the state, is a common course.
3818	47	As we leave the Marxist starting point of 17N and approach the nihilist inspiration of modern armed groups, the distance from the masses is not considered a weakness for which they must apologize, but a conscious and acceptable reality. They despise the resigned petty bourgeois, they expect any of them, and just the actors confirm their freedom. What the leftist armed action in the past was apologizing here: the masses are sleeping, the guerrilla is doing on their behalf.
3818	49	We know the consequence of the above very well, because it has been studied in recent years. Anti -terrorist policy - especially after September 11 - constitutes a whole field of research, whose central point is summarized that terrorism is the ideal alibi to suppress what is left of democratic freedoms. The steady left -wing criticism of terrorism is that it is a politically ineffective violence, which achieves the opposite of the intended results, giving the state alibi to legitimize its repressive purposes in social consciousness.
3818	51	Conclusions
3818	53	Having spent three decades in illegality and another in prison, having done something that is together marginal and irrevocable, such as murder, we expect to hear how he thinks about it today. Koufontina regrets only the distance from the masses, this is the only self -criticism he accepts for the action of 17N.
3818	55	Murder is always an act of barbarism, against which the man who is not bloodthirsty is awe and aversion. But the question is what happens not when he suddenly decides to shoot a random passerby in the crowd, but to respond to an existing barbarism. The sacredness of human life does not seem to me sufficient to reject the armed struggle. However, if the victims' guilt may be debatable, it does not justify the murder. In the last two arguments, justice and mass, I would like to dwell more. As long as the legal institutions are militant against the weak, our arguments against self -judge will always be undermined. No matter how we disgust violence, there can be no effective antithesis in self -righteousness, as long as justice makes the oppressed and winks at the powerful, that is, the repressive mechanisms of legal violence defend the established injustice.
3818	57	As for the latest issue, the permanent obsession of his self -criticism, the only one that Koufontina shares and permeates the whole book and occupying a dominant position on his ending pages, alienation from the masses: This is not an internal issue of balances or choices. of 17N. This is the only way in which something can change. That is why when the state speaks of "terrorism" it has not only one dragon of armed, but what it is mainly afraid of, that is, the mass action against the interests of the few. The anti -terrorist reason concerns the armed struggle, but in practice it concerns every struggle. Strengthening state discourse and consolidating order of order and security means that political movements will be suppressed that are not armed at all, but simply resist the letter of an unfair law. The terrorism of the press we are discussing, not generally and indefinitely the violence of the insurgents, but the conspiracy violence of closed small groups, has nothing to offer politically in this respect, except to legitimize state repression towards any act of uprising. And when one paints one's hands with blood, as the revolutionaries have had to cost the costs in many moments of history, there should be reasons that would not be challenged: not only to withstand the sausage, but not to be otherwise. When in the notice entitled "Manifesto of '92" it is stated that "success of 17N is its only existence" (406), we realize that this reason of the man who feels justified and only acting, in the wilderness of politics, he has as much as he has, It separates its position from any revolutionary vision, and constitutes a psychological fairy tale of the members of the organization. It is reminiscent of the joyous report of the Athens Anarchist Labor Association in 1900: "Our partner Andreas Theodoridis, in order to celebrate his marriage to Comrade Angeliki Drosopoulou, attempts to perform two well -known interests on the day of their wedding." The act is described as a cosmic event, regardless of consequences and ethics.
3818	59	The discussion of Koufontina's book was consistent with the attempt to identify SYRIZA with terrorism through the foreword, and the political debate to be confined to the drama of the relatives of the murdered people. This clearly shows exactly what the aspirations of anti -terrorist discourse are. Our efforts I think should be directed to discuss with attention where the impasses of armed action are identified, while also demonstrating the acting condemnation of violence and the use of terrorism or "terrorism" as a method of advertising the need for more repression. A world without violence would be better, I don't oppose. The one -sided and hypocritical condemnation of the violence of only one side does not contribute in this direction.

3819	5	Nikos Karanikas, a former strategic planning adviser of Alexis Tsipras, took place in the "vibrant" intra-party dialogue of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance, responding to the opposition of the leftist wing of the party (with the left-handed "Leftist" election of the Chairman and the Central Committee from the organized base.

382	1	"Fire" George Romanos: “The story with Antonov is dirty. How does an airplane, moving bomb gets in and popping out of Kavala? All of this "smells" of interest in interest "”
382	3	“48 years the Cyprus envelope is closed. Speaking to Focus FM 103.6 and Stefanos Damianidis, the author and historical researcher, George Romanos. ”There is many 48 years. There is great pain, great heroism of Greek military and great betrayal. ”
382	5	“Russia knows very well what it is doing, it has not declared war. Makes special businesses. The fact that America promotes this conflict is a crime. This crime has also been expanded to energy, and America and Europe are kneeling right now. "
382	7	Mr Romanos spoke about the long -term agreement on joint flights to the International Space Station, signed by Roskosmos and NASA.
382	9	“They will continue to work together, don't go far, right now through Ukraine. Who do they fool? ”
382	11	"The story with Antonov is dirty. A huge airplane that "lifts" 20 tonnes of cargo, full of dangerous ammunition, gets into a country of blunt vine and pops outside Kavala. Is this normal? And where do we know it happened? The Foreign Minister had to resign, but who is kind to resignations? How does an airplane, moving bomb gets in and popping out of Kavala? If, as we were told, it had normal ammunition, there is not such a big explosion. Why so much wide? Within less than 4 hours this plane caught 4 critical destinations. In Sarajevo, Ankara, Nis, and Belgrade. And he wanted to go to Aman too. All of this "smells" of a business.
382	13	“Those who are guilty of the history of the coronation had to be in prison. But in what country, with what justice? What the one -commander -in -chief knows? It is clear that their efforts worldwide is not convinced.
3820	1	Ukrainians want weapons and not advice
3820	3	Ukrainians want weapons and not advice
3820	5	The climate in the tired EU It begins to become negative for the fighting Ukraine. The voices of compromise with Russia, that is, the voices calling the Ukrainians to deliver with their signature part of their territories, are heard more intense.
3820	7	E. Macron was clear from Romania. "Ukraine at some point will have to negotiate with Russia." The worrying is not in the content of the statement. It goes without saying that "at some point Ukraine should negotiate with Russia". The worry is that today, while the battles are raging, it is untimely a leader of a long -level talk about negotiations. Today, what matters is to provide military aid to Ukraine, beyond all others and for one more reason. In the negotiations that will be "at some point" not to come to Ukraine as a sheep on slaughter. To have achieved successes on the battlefields that will make it an equal interlocutor on the other side. But to do so, the Ukrainian army is needed.
3820	9	I am very afraid that Macron's visit to Ukraine will not have a positive development. If the French president repeats his position in front of Zelenski, while he is asking for military assistance, it is reasonable for the Ukrainian leader to explode publicly. At such times, Real Politic and the so -called "voices of logic" sound.
3820	11	Unlike the leaders of aging Europe, the US elites in the majority arrested the essence of the problem. Who is she;
3820	13	1.The invader in the end cannot be the winner. Losses on the battlefield and the consequences of financial sanctions should create a negative balance for him. Russia does not withstand long -term sanctions due to its shallowness and small size of its economy.
3820	15	2. It seems that the United States, unlike some European leaders, will not accept after the war as their interlocutor. Putin. They will not give him a forgiveness either for the invasion or the war crimes committed and committed by his army.
3820	17	This difference in the strategic view of the Ukrainian War explains why the EU He will never emerge as a central player on the world stage. A collective of states lost in the trees and cannot see the forest is doomed by History itself. And the trees in this case are the price of gas and oil, primary surpluses and profits of the German industry. And the forest is the next step of Putin's Russia. What will be her next victim.
3820	19	PS. I do not believe Macron, if there is any "wrong" with Turkey, tell us that we should negotiate!
3821	1	Kyriakos Mitsotakis, why didn't you say it to Biden?
3821	3	The absolute shame of the Greek government.
3821	5	Written by George Michalalas
3821	7	Loose. Smiling. Cheerful. Up to cheerful.
3821	9	Embarrassing and commodity engagement,
3821	11	seated carefree cross -legged next to the American president,
3821	13	Like a carefree cross, he was sitting at the funeral of Mikis Theodorakis.
3821	15	Self -care. Blatant bastard.
3821	17	Great greatness;
3821	19	It's not a little bit, it's not a small thing,
3821	21	To give a reception in your honor the leader of the global super-power.
3821	23	What if your challengers will make the thought
3821	25	"Since Mitsotakis can be found in the White House, can everyone ..."?
3821	27	The outcome counts…
3821	29	…
3821	31	So I saw Kyriakos Mitsotakis in his own world,
3821	33	I was in favor of - for a nigged time - to a dream regime
3821	35	where Napoleonism and Ludovicism are joined to a flesh one,
3821	37	I thought that this hereditary offense prime minister was raising rates
3821	39	that - if we analyze their core - constitute political dystopia;
3821	41	a dystopia formally described exquisitely by Chinese proverb
3821	43	"A dog with money is called" Mr. Dog "."
3821	45	(where "money", every form of "power").
3821	47	In the beginning, the meeting with Joe Biden. Then, the reception.
3821	49	Then, the next day,
3821	51	Meetings with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,
3821	53	And with the Vice President of the US Government, Kamala Harris
3821	55	(but also the infamous first speech of a Greek Prime Minister in Congress).
3821	57	...
3821	59	On the one hand, the "Democratic Party" of the United States.
3821	61	On the other hand, the "New Democracy" of the quarterly modern Greek banana.
3821	63	Is there a relationship between these two concepts?
3821	65	Kyriakos Mitsotakis-Geo Biden
3821	67	Kyriakos Mitsotakis-Nanssi Pelosi
3821	69	Kyriakos Mitsotakis-Kamala Harris
3821	71	Undoubtedly, three extremely important meetings, but they have a heavy shadow ...
3821	73	American society was in one more shock from Sunday,
3821	75	After the new "blind" racist attack that left behind 10 dead and 3 injured.
3821	77	An 18 -year -old far -right, a chalet -shaped white color,
3821	79	attacked with a weapon to unsuspecting people,
3821	81	Just because they were disturbed by the different color of their skin.
3821	83	Well, when I saw the Greek Prime Minister on the side of the American president
3821	85	and at the same time to leave for his forthcoming contacts with the two powerful ladies,
3821	87	spontaneously appeared in my thought the relentless question
3821	89	Kyriakos Mitsotakis,
3821	91	Why don't you talk to Joe Biden, Nancy Pelozi and Kamala Harris,
3821	93	For Thanos Plevris ..? "
3821	95	On April 10, 2011, the then MP of the far -right "LAOS",
3821	97	is engaged - in the case of a Uganese audience - to the following racist delirium:
3821	99	"You hear me how 'migratory' can be resolved.
3821	101	"Migration", in my view, can be resolved in two ways,
3821	103	who are slowly saying clearly.
3821	105	The first way is to guard the border, which to understand what we mean ... Border guard can not exist if there are no losses.
3821	107	And to be understood,
3821	109	(border guarding cannot exist) if there are no dead.
3821	111	…
3821	113	(his bloodthirsty phrase,
3821	115	interrupted by enthusiastic applause
3821	117	and the cheerleaders of his Uganese audience;
3821	119	The cheers act as anabolic for Plevris,
3821	121	continuing his bloodthirsty delusions)
3821	123	…
3821	125	The guard of the borders is dead.
3821	127	So first.
3821	129	And secondly, those who are now here will have the "logic of disincentives".
3821	131	I don't believe so much in Dublin
3821	133	(meaning Dublin's regulation,
3821	135	on the re -establishment of asylum seekers in their first country of entry into Europe).
3821	137	And to be denounced,
3821	139	Islam will come, it will come in, it will sink Europe's inland,
3821	141	It will sink Greece afterwards.
3821	143	The point is to cut them. Not to come.
3821	145	Therefore, when you are here beyond, no social benefit you will have,
3821	147	(but in addition) you will not be able to eat, you will not be able to drink,
3821	149	You will not be able to go to the hospital
3821	151	and you'll tell others in Pakistan
3821	153	"Here we are getting worse than in Pakistan."
3821	155	If they do not pass worse, they will come.
3821	157	They have to get worse.
3821	159	Their life, hell will look paradise to what they will live here.
3821	161	(applause)".
3821	163	It is scary the fact,
3821	165	that this delirium could be the ideological manifesto
3821	167	For the 18 -year -old far -right,
3821	169	For the chalet on white color
3821	171	attacked with a weapon to unsuspecting people
3821	173	—poling 10 and injuring 3-
3821	175	Just because they were disturbed by the different color of their skin.
3821	177	And yet, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Joe Biden's boastful interlocutor,
3821	179	Nancy Pelosi's boasting interlocutor and Kamala Harris,
3821	181	the triumphant in words and subdued to the acts,
3821	183	He did not serve to put Thanos Plevris in his party, in his government,
3821	185	and - the absence of empathy and vulva - to be assigned by the Ministry of Health.
3821	187	In the end, what is the conclusion?
3821	189	The conclusion is one and only feeling: sadness.
3821	191	Sadness about the power that people give to unworthy people.
3821	193	Sadness to institutionalize impotence through popular vote.
3821	195	Sad for a declining Greece that Kyriakos Mitsotakis has chosen to represent.
3821	197	Sadness about the loose perception expressed by the average voter,
3821	199	who is a doomed to choose his like
3821	201	Guided by his own fruitful hope:
3821	203	"Since Mitsotakis can be found in the White House, I can."
3821	205	Tragic.
3821	207	George Michalas
3822	1	Nord Stream 1 END! SCENARIES OF TRUE TO STOP OF NATURAL GAS FROM RUSSIA - GREAT POINTS AND SOCIAL RISE! Does Sri Lanca show the road for the countries of Europe?
3822	3	Horror scenarios with European cities being powered by the Bulletin and for intense social upheavals caused by energy poverty are fastened to the states of Old Epirus as Putin's Moscow plays hard poker with gas supply with the landmark date July 11, 2022.
3822	5	As the tensions for the Russian war in Ukraine are escalating, European Union officials fear that the situation may worsen.
3822	7	Today Russia closed its main pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 1, for 10 days of scheduled maintenance.
3822	9	Many in Berlin - but also throughout the EU are afraid that it will never reopen, and this feeds panic movements and fears of great social upheavals and creates fears of burglary of social cohesion.
3822	11	In GREECE
3822	13	Concern has also been transferred to the south of Europe where governments do not exclude either a vacation and gas vacation domino in case Gazprom cuts flows via Nord Stream 1 in central countries or closes the Turk Stream pipeline Hellas.
3822	15	At the same time, answering a question in an interview with Bloomberg, Greece's central banker Yiannis Stournaras, despite rejecting the recession scenarios, pointed out that the development would be significantly affected by the possibility that Russian gas faiths would be closed.
3822	17	The political risk from energy poverty
3822	19	In a greater gas break, Germany and other Central European countries will suffer a huge financial loss which, in combination with inflationary pressures and rising costs of lending, will bring energy poverty, in serious political risk.
3822	21	According to the FT in a report on Saturday July 9th, Germany is now going on a hot water card, lowering the streets and closes the pools, as the impact of energy crisis begins to spread like the proverbial wave of Ice-Nine by the Industry in offices, leisure centers and residences.
3822	23	The reason behind Germany's slow movement paralysis is well known: the huge increase in gas prices caused by Russia's move last month to abruptly reduce Germany has sank Europe's largest economy in its worst energy crisis. From the shock of oil prices in 1973 - as for those who exist the economy is a huge shock to supply.
3822	25	Danger to social cohesion
3822	27	With electricity values ​​touching the highest levels than ever, gas importers and utilities are struggling for survival, while consumer accounts are ejected at incredible heights
3822	29	"The situation is more than dramatic," said Axel Gedaschko, head of the GDW German housing federation.
3822	31	"Germany's social cohesion is in great danger."
3822	33	The shock to the offer
3822	35	Referring to the infamous July 22nd Day, when the Russian gas flows are expected to resume, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid writes that "while we all spend most of our time on the market thinking of the Fed and the recession, I suspect that what is happening with Russian gas is potentially an even bigger story.
3822	37	Of course, by July 22, parts may have been found and the offer may start to normalize.
3822	39	Anyone who tells you that he knows what is going to happen here is guessing, but at least it should be a huge focus for all markets. "
3822	41	The bank also warns that "unless gas stops are resolved in the coming weeks, this will lead to an expansion of energy disorder with significant advance impact on economic growth and of course much higher inflation".
3822	43	Europe's failure - the rift for its dissolution?
3822	45	Europe has failed to prioritize energy security and has now been found exposed and excessively dependent on Russian energy, so it is forced to pay high prices for energy.
3822	47	This is the big mistake she is called upon to face at a collective and individual level, which causes cracks in her cohesion.
3822	49	France is facing this issue with the re -nationalization of its largest energy utility company to ensure survival through nuclear energy.
3822	51	Germany, which is undoubtedly the country that has suffered more than energy security failures, may soon have to save its largest utilities as well.
3822	53	In today's statements Sunday, July 10, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe should be prepared for the complete stoppage of Russian gas traditions.
3822	55	"Let's prepare for a complete interruption of Russian gas," Mr Le Maire said at an Economic Conference at AX-AN-Porovans in southern France today Sunday, July 10th.
3822	57	"This is the most likely scenario today."
3822	59	France must be careful in energy consumption, create gas reserves, reduce bureaucracy by slowing down the growth of renewable energy sources, and accelerating its program for the construction of new nuclear reactors, the finance minister said.
3822	61	In this context, as France has already been announced, it has turned to EDF.
3823	1	We still didn't see anything from Russia, China
3823	3	The Brazilian journalist and geopolitical analyst, Pepe Escobar, appears in his article, blaming the West leaders for how they handle the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and estimates Russia and China will strengthen their alliance against the alliance. In the West.
3823	5	"The declining Roman emperors at least showed some degree of passion.
3823	7	Here we are confronted with a toxic mixture of insults, disgusting moderation, illusion, raw ideological sheep thinking and unequivocal irrationality - all the symptoms of a deep illness of the soul.
3823	9	Calling it Biden - Leyen - Blinken or that would be overly reducing: After all, they are petty politicians who are just parroting orders.
3823	11	This is a historical process: physical, mental and moral cognitive degeneration, integrated into Natostan's obvious despair in trying to contain Eurasia, allowing occasionally tragic sketches such as a NATO summit that declared war on almost the whole. .
3823	13	You haven't seen anything yet'
3823	15	When President Putin addresses the collective west in front of Duma leaders and leaders of political parties, he feels like a comet hitting an inert planet.
3823	17	"Today we hear that they want to beat us on the battlefield, well, what can I say, let them try.
3823	19	We have heard many times that the West wants to fight us until the last Ukrainian - this is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people.
3823	21	But it seems that everything ends up with it.
3823	23	Everyone should know that, in general, we have really started anything yet. "
3823	25	Fact. In business Z (Russian invasion of Ukraine), Russia is using a fraction of its military potential, resources and weapons of state -of -the -art technology, "Escobar explains.
3823	27	End to the US world order
3823	29	"We do not deny peace negotiations, but those who refuse should know that the longer it is, the more difficult it will be for them to negotiate with us," Putin said.
3823	31	Here is the undoubtedly a key quote, notes Escobar:
3823	33	"They should have realized that they have already lost since the beginning of our special military operation, because its principle means the beginning of a radical collapse of the world class, as the US has shaped it.
3823	35	This is the beginning of the transition from the liberal-pancreatic American self-centeredness to a truly multipolar world-a world that is not based on selfish rules invented by someone for themselves, behind which there is nothing but the desire for hegemony, Not to hypocritical double standards. But in international law, in the true sovereignty of peoples and cultures, in their willingness to live their historical fate, their values ​​and traditions and to build cooperation on the basis of democracy, justice and equality.
3823	37	And we must understand that this process can no longer stop, "Putin said.
3824	1	Nord Stream I closed: EU gas reserves "squeeze" without alternative power supplies
3824	3	From today, the Nord Stream I pipeline is also typically off to maintain and make the necessary tests but Brussels is afraid of what will happen after July 21st, which is scheduled for work.
3824	5	Because despite the orchestrated western media the EU, it has not found alternative supplies and as it all shows, they will not find it and winter will be tragic.
3824	7	On the contrary, these have been reduced after recent incidents in the US
3824	9	Four European governments have already been overturned due to accuracy in Britain, France, Bulgaria and Germany (in the September elections).
3824	11	Restrictions on oil production and liquefied LNG gas, coupled with prices, enhance the risk of shortages that, in the event of a total interruption, will necessarily limit the consumption and bulletin of natural gas distribution.
3824	13	What narrative will Europeans offer? What is "bad Putin" responsible? Why is she responsible? Because he is forbidden from exporting raw materials? So is he to blame for shortages when he is not allowed to cover them?
3824	15	And all this to serve American interests? Because a European interest is certainly not as it turns out as a result.
3824	17	To just say: European Governments prefer their citizens to "tear from hunger" and freeze their "heart" in the winter rather than admit that they made the most wrong mistakes (in this case US interests) The interests of European peoples.
3824	19	It is so great that their insistence is to distort reality and support their choice to "camouflage" the food crisis coming due to the non -export of Russian fertilizers, which support the narrative (as in the Netherlands, resulting in violent conflicts erupted. Between farmers and police) that large agricultural production and livestock farming are responsible for… climate change due to carbon dioxide production!
3824	21	The EU and between them and Greece must fill up to 80% of annual consumption by November 1, in order to ensure their energy competence for the winter season.
3824	23	With what is happening this seems impossible.
3824	25	Greece covers about 40% of the imports of Russian gas, no matter what the Greek government "About Competence" claims.
3824	27	PPC Managing Director Mr. George Stassis from the ECONOMIST step, predicted that the possibility of a violent Russian gas interruption, there would be a great deal of turmoil in the market, which for Greece would lead to an energy cut by industry to cover the Home consumers.
3824	29	What does that mean? That if natural gas is indeed unable to meet domestic demand, then industry will be reduced so that they do not stay critical infrastructure and households without electricity.
3824	31	Since state Gazprom has limited 60% of gas to Germany in mid -June, prices have begun a new upward trend that does not seem to end.
3824	33	In the middle of last week, the price on the Dutch brokerage platform (TTF) climbed the megawattra in 184 euros, exceeding last March's price levels.
3824	35	These prices that have direct reflection on the cost of electricity also shift the Ministry's plan to determine the new electricity invoices by suppliers by July 25, although the original plan was foreseen that it was announced yesterday 10 July.
3824	37	However, the risk of announcing tariffs over 50 minutes per kilowatt -hour (today without subsidies is about 35 minutes), it has led to a new design.
3824	39	Natural gas covers 44.5%of the energy mix in Greece RES 25.1%, lignite below 10%, imports 8%and hydroelectricity almost 6%.
3824	41	Consequently, additional state support and larger fiscal space is sought or otherwise the accounts will continue to be "astronomical" and in the end the citizens in each of their regulation to electricity providers will have to give ... two salaries, which is impossible for mathematical reasons. …
3824	43	Those who pay electricity bills in recent months have come to despair as their income is not enough to pay them even if they do not eat anything.
3824	45	"Things may be very bad in the coming period, we may actually find ourselves in situations, especially in gas that will be unprecedented for Greece," Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Parliament a few days ago, and he even used it as one of them. Basic arguments for not holding early elections (polls were the main reason but this is not publicly not discussed). Already, estimates in Germany are talking about twice as much or even four times the power accounts if the supply is completely discontinued by the Russians because of its full country from Gazprom's supplies.
3824	47	Of course no one will have to pay this money.
3824	49	As far as LNG is concerned, it does not seem to be available from Americans and secondly it is expensive.
3824	51	"The issue that is now being raised by market players is still for a while Greece, but other countries in Europe will be able to import LNG to the stratospheric prices that have been formed," the head of the South East Energy Institute (IENE ) Mr. Costas Stambolis.
3824	53	As characteristically notes, if prices are maintained for a few more months above € 160 / mWh, there will be a rationalization of the number of LNG loads that companies will be able to enter without the risk of registering serious damage as Prices will be raised. This concern was also confirmed by Evangelos Mytileneos, speaking at the same Economist conference.
3824	55	As he said, "Greece will not have a problem with energy competence. The problem will be prices and where the LNG will be found. " He even noted that the Greek market needs 40 to 45 LNG loads to meet the annual needs in the event of a stoppage and that Mytileneos has already closed 24 loads.
3824	57	He confirmed the nightmarish forecasts if the Russian gas flow was stopped, as today only with the possibility, the price already reaches 200 euros by Megawattore, when pre -crisis was 20 euros/MWh.
3824	59	According to DESFA estimates, Gazprom would be able to equalize 50% of annual consumption by June 2023.
3824	61	These are 38.7 times that correspond to about 46 LNG boats up to June 2023, of which 26 TWHs are intended for the supply of Greece and others to support Bulgaria in the context of European cooperation and solidarity.
3824	63	It should be noted that in June, the EU introduced for the first time in its history more liquefied LNG gas than the US than through Russia through natural gas pipelines.
3824	65	But as we said, American LNG costs and this in itself increases the cost of all other things.
3824	67	But even so, will there be sufficient quantities?
3824	69	Just a day after the announcements of American Cheniere Energy Inc, which is the top US LNG exporter, that he will be forced to close for a long time and endanger the country's commitment to increase LNG supply yesterday of the explosion in a building of the Oneok Gas Company in Medford, Oklahoma.
3824	71	It was necessary to evacuate the space not only from employees in the company, but also to evacuate their homes and all the inhabitants within two miles from the factory.
3824	73	Some time ago, an explosion had occurred at the US freeport LNG terminal in Texas.
3824	75	The incident has caused gas prices in Europe due to supply restrictions.
3824	77	So how will the US keep their commitments to adequate EU supply?
3824	79	But in the US, the price for gas, on the other hand, decreased by 40%, Bloomberg said. Because export cancellation means that it will remain more gas available for internal use.
3825	1	670 mouths hermetically closed
3825	3	Migrants and refugee prisoners continue the hunger strike in the Corinthian camp, with a key demand to stop the disrespectful detention. The extension of administrative detention after the 18 -month maximum legal limit shall be applied by order of the Ministry of Public Order, based on the - controlled - opinion of the State Legal Council. A decision of the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance has ruled the detention of more than 18 months, and other court rulings are expected following appeals by lawyers.
3825	5	The hunger strike began on Monday by the 670 immigrant detainees in Corinth, abstaining from the food. Yesterday they visited a delegation of SYRIZA, consisting of MPs Vassiliki Katrivanou and Kostas Zacharias, lawyers, members of the Department of Rights, Local SYRIZA and Corinthian anti -racist initiative. According to police, about 200 people continue to abstain from food, but almost all immigrants who talked to the delegation said hunger strikers.
3825	7	Pretensions
3825	9	They welcomed the visitors with the cards of detention in hand, anxiously asking how to extend their martyrdom. "We are told that we will stay here forever, if we do not sign up for expulsion," said Algeria immigrants to team members, and admitted that even those who sign voluntary retirement are still being held for months.
3825	11	The 152 immigrants who have completed the 18 months, of which 40 were transferred to Amygdaleza are in despair, on the official reason for the recording of the asylum request. There is no asylum office in Corinth, so that the demands of those who say they want asylum. However, there is a office of the International Organization for Migration to facilitate voluntary departures.
3825	13	The capacity of the camp is up to 891 people and will increase to 1,600, when the new wings manufactured by AKTOR (Bobola interests) are completed. Immigrants are held in 12 -person chambers, with bunk beds stacked side by side, as the minimum free space is usually occupied by an improvised prayer. One of the biggest problems, in addition to the barbarism of constant incarceration, are bad hygiene conditions, with deficiencies in personal items and cleaners.
3825	15	Patients with serious illnesses have been left without medication for months -Formally has been treated by EKEPY, the contract has not been completed and the medicines are purchased by police funds. A recruitment has been created, which is inactive, since there are no basic infrastructure. But there is a surgeon - while there is not even respiratory mask - and gynecologist for an exclusively male population!
3825	17	The only drugs given relatively easily are psychotropic drugs. Three Syrian refugees are held in the camp for deportation after conviction for criminal offenses, a refugee from Eritrea and Iranian journalist, while six minors were transferred to the detention center in Loutraki. Two Pakistan immigrants held for 17 months had sewn their mouths -they were able to take out the stitches just in the morning before the visit.
3825	19	As camp psychologists and police officers admitted, cases of anxiety and depression were fired when the detention was extended over 18 months. Immigrants reacted with fainting, screams, hitting the head on the wall, and the hunger strike was the first group protest in the unfair and irrational decision.
3825	21	- Open initiative against detention centers on Sunday, June 15, is calling for solidarity and march outside the Corinthian camp. The coaches depart at 10.30 from the Archaeological Museum and return from Corinth at 17.00.
3826	1	Town Planning and Matt vs. Roma
3826	3	A double raid from the MAT squads accompanied by the prosecutor and the urban planning took place yesterday morning at the Roma camp in the Mint area, Chalandri. During the raid, there was an investigation into any illegalities, but what is of particular interest is to identify persons and the registration of houses made in order to determine who and how many are staying in the camp.
3826	5	"The state has just acquired a comprehensive picture of how many people stay there, which cancels all the decisions on demolition and relocation," he tells Ef. Panagiotis Dimitras, a legal representative of the EPSE and an authorized representative of the Roma Association "Hope".
3826	7	Recall that Secretary General Decentralized Administration of Attica, Dimitris Kalogeropoulos, has issued a decision to demolish the camp on February 25, 2014 and relocated the Roma of Chalandri to Mount Father. The process, however, has collapsed, as the mayors of both the Grand and the Mandra are strongly reacting to the possible transfer, with the Mayor of Megara having already legally appealed against the Roma Halandri Roma decision.
3826	9	Residential demolition decisions are based on the protocol with dossier number 3083/96, according to which there are 43 homes belonging to 38 owners. Since then, only 45% of owners and 44% of homes are currently in the camp in the "Pine Citizen", which raises questions about which houses are legal to demolish, while the immediate issuance of a new protocol is considered imperative.
3826	11	Mr Dimitras stresses that in terms of the Secretary General of Decentralized Administration of Attica, the issuance of the demolition decision is an offense to international justice, as UN interim measures have been in force since May last year.
3826	13	Mr. Stelios Kalamiotis, president of the Roma Association "Hope" denounced yesterday's police action as "fascist and absolutely wrong". The raid took place at 08.00, as the children went to school, so they were terrified. "It is an abusive, racist and illegal act," Mr Dimitras in turn complains to "Ef. Only for a case of rheumatoid arthritis, it is made to remind you that everyone is guilty of being guilty, simply because they are Gypsies. "
3827	1	"Strawberries and ... nonsense"
3827	3	Yesterday, in the 700 -reader newspaper "Avgi", a woman columnist wrote an article entitled "Strawberries and Blood in the Polytechnic" referring to the events that occurred at Columbia University in April 1968, during the student uprising. (Hence the ironic title of my article.) Obviously, the columnist compares what happened in the Student Painter with what happened at the Columbia University at the time. Then do not wonder why the "dawn" sells only 700 sheets. And there is a lot!
3827	5	The article, written by a woman again, treats it with an irony of the female police officer who was attacked by a screwdriver by a drug trafficker, an irony with a strong element of sexism. Obviously, the columnist behind the safety of her computer is unable to conceive the dangers of other women who, for 800 euros, fight for our own and her own quiet.
3827	7	It is understood that throughout the text there is no word for the occupation of an entire floor of the student home by extracurricans with abusive behaviors of common criminal law. So what remains is the invasion of ELAS, the shots and the disasters caused by the police operation.
3827	9	So the "Dawn" columnist reasonably wonders: "What will happen? Arrests, exiles, torture and tanks? Shame, shame, because a few years ago we had democracy. We don't have now. We have a parliamentary dictatorship. " Reason for delusional, thought simplistic, no contact with reality, as the lady has built her own reality and she refers to it.
3827	11	At the same wavelength are Mr. Tzanakopoulos and Spirtzis. They denounce ELAS, without mentioning the reason why the business was made. Obviously, they find it normal in a student home, a whole floor has turned into a drug trafficking hangout by people involved in kidnappings and rape. Let Mr Tzanakopoulos ask his brother who teaches Oxford if such things happen there.
3827	13	SYRIZA has not yet understood that these policies are cut off by citizens who have to be affiliated if they want to resume. When the newspaper "Avgi", Mr. Tzanakopoulos and Spirtzis support the glaring lawlessness, then the New Democracy can sleep quietly. She has found her sponsors.
3827	15	I will not theoretically substantiate the alibi of the radical left with some criminal, nor how and when it started. The only ones who are sorry for this coverage offered by some SYRIZA executives are A. Tsipras who is trying to approach the Sun - Pandeles and the ill -fated bridges, old and young, who are trying to fill the drips - dripping the Kardaras, but All kinds of tsanakopoulos with a kick empty it.
3828	1	SYRIZA's one who saw Push Forward
3828	3	The days are passing and only the NGO Humanrights360 was forced to apologize for the fake story of the dead little Maria and the trapped refugees in the Ammonisis in Evros. The lie that various… valid journalists and foreign media have built and disputed Greece.
3828	5	Both Spiegel and Channel 4, who broadcast in live time and false news, did not remedy. The Greek media journalist who had implied that he would have a new report is "ignored". Colleague Vasiliki Siouti, who has confirmed with the on -the -spot report that there is no dead little girl, but is alive, threatened by strangers. SYRIZA does not "apologize" though it has exhausted all the room for opposition fake history to hurt the government.
3828	7	But one inside SYRIZA saw the light true!
3828	9	He talks about the Turkish push forward of refugees and immigrants from the Turkish authorities, the EU tolerance in Erdogan's dirty games and calls for "hypocritical bilingualism against the bully in the area, Tayyip Erdogan".
3828	11	He has a special burden that this is MEP Costas Arvanitis who at first not only had adopted all the made history with the "naughty" little girl, but along with the other MEP Stelios Kouloglou had submitted an urgent question to the Commission.
3828	13	"A 5 -year -old girl lost her life from scorpion sting on the islet and her mother maintains her corpse in the river water to slow down, while there is another 9 -year -old girl in critical condition and there are three pregnant women among the trapped and several pregnant women. who need urgent medical help, ”they wrote and asked the Commission to reply whether Frontex would intervene in order to unload the refugee group, to receive the necessary humanitarian protection and medical care, and to ensure dignified burial conditions for the 5 -year -old girl.
3828	15	In addition, they were asking what the Commission would do to end, "in violation of any international legality and fundamental rights, the practice of pushbacks in land and maritime borders of Greece-Turkey that continues despite the international outcry."
3828	17	A month later, the MEP alone this time calls on the European Commission to take a public position on the tooling of refugees and pushforwards from the Erdogan regime.
3828	19	Although it is unprecedented for SYRIZA's official to say publicly - and even with a question to the European Parliament - that Turkey is making a push forward without hint about Greek pushbacks, however, the question is not so innocent.
3828	21	It is asking the Commission to answer, whether Turkey can now be considered a safe third country, as long as there are such extensive coercive movements of refugees to the border with the EU, that is, at the maritime and land borders of our country.
3828	23	It does not, of course, unaware that the foundation stone of the EU - Erdogan agreement on refugees is the recognition of Turkey as a safe third country. He also remembers that the deal was signed by Alexis Tsipras, who then called on the EU to implement its commitments to Turkey: financial assistance and liberalization of visa for Turkish citizens.
3829	1	Completed deposits in the examination exams - Androulakis: Double scandal The case
3829	3	Completed deposits in the examination exams - Androulakis: Double scandal The case
3829	5	Opposition parties have denounced approaches to close the processes of the examination
3829	7	End titles fell on Friday to the Inquiry Committee on the surveillance with Nikos Androulakis' deposition closing the list of witnesses. The refusal of the majority to invite new witnesses also prompted the opposition parties to react. "The deposition of PASOK-KINAL Chairman Nikos Androulakis did not offer anything substantial to the work of the Inquiry Committee," the ND CO commented at the end of the process.
3829	9	"A deposition full of arrogance, without any specific information or answers to the key questions raised," he noted, commenting on Mr Androulakis' deposition to the House Inquiry Committee.
3829	11	As the majority points out, PASOK's president avoided taking a position on the crucial question of whether the country's political staff should be excluded from the surveillance, while drawing up with SYRIZA in the Pizziorla case, downplaying it. The ND KO also stressed Mr Androulakis' tactics to choose the questions he wishes to answer, downgrading the institution of the Member.
3829	13	PASOK sources noted that "there is no brake on the downhill New Democracy", while PASOK -KINAL president reportedly attributed personal responsibilities to Kyriakos Mitsotakis. "Which Greek thinks the prime minister didn't know?" They commented on typical associates of Nikos Androulakis.
3829	15	In a statement, SYRIZA complained that "the government's approach to close the Inquiry Committee, as they note, despite the revelations and reports that prove that Stamatis Trimbalis of Krikel has falsely martyred".
3829	17	In their announcement, they add that "today is a day of shame for the Greek parliament and democracy, but the issue does not close here. The Committee on Institutions and Transparency is expected, where all businessmen involved, visible and invisible as well as the politicians involved will be asked to explain. No matter how much the government wants to close the scandal of espionage, which is an open wound for democracy, those responsible will be held accountable to justice, either before or after the elections. "
3829	19	The KKE, in its announcement, notes, among other things, that it is "closing - a closure of the Inquiry Committee, under the responsibility of the government majority".
3829	21	Androulakis: "Double Scandal"
3829	23	In his testimony, PASOK's president launched a direct attack on the prime minister and the government, saying that his monitoring concerned political reasons rather than national security. Without hiding his disappointment on the course of the examination, he enriched the members of the committee that they have not called all the persons involved and asking the victim.
3829	25	He allegedly reiterated his request and asked for everyone involved in the case. As he typically said, "I put each one of you before his political responsibilities. Was the examination to call a single political person, that is, the victim? Take on your responsibilities and call all the dark faces leading the country to medieval situations. "
3829	27	"I would accept information at any time - but only legally and in writing. The government is completely unreliable for any oral conversation, "Mr Androulakis noted, adding that the lamentation says:" Everything in the light "but hides behind the law he suggested and forbids the ADAE from informing the monitor. He even left spikes for the prime minister, noting
3829	29	Insisting on the view that his monitoring was for political reasons, he wondered why, after reasons, he did not continue and after his election. Indeed, he allegedly stressed that "my archive was destroyed, because if there was, they would have to say what they found and continued my illegal attendance. If there was a reason for national security, you would have made a flyer to crush PASOK. There is no reason for national security, but ND policy. " In fact, he argued that "my monitoring by the EYP was radiography of all of our lineup".
3829	31	According to reports, during his deposition, with particular emotional charge, he stressed that the issue of national danger has hurt him as a Greek patriot. "Shame, shame, shame. I have fought in Europe and outside Europe for national interests. I work for the home country. Some are not tourists in Brussels, "he allegedly emphasized, adding that" it is miserable for the scenarios to be involved in foreign embassies ", while the Foreign Ministry has put a brake on these scenarios.
3829	33	Referring to leaks for his family and his personal life, Mr. Androulakis emphasized that "I do not bend neither I nor my family from the miserable rumors, circulating specific propaganda mechanisms. I'm here to deal with everything in the light of day and not in the dark. I am not afraid of anything. Pure sky, lightning is not afraid. "
3829	35	Upon completion of the witnesses, the committee's work will be closed with the filing of the Commission's final finding.

383	1	She is propaganda
383	3	The jungle posted a video uploaded on Twitter early Monday afternoon, apparently by some Ukrainian fighters, possibly fanatical activists. Video records many hard images. Two Ukrainians shoot three of the Russians in the cold. They shoot them on their feet with Kalasnikov. These people are excluded from walking back into their lives if they survive the bleeding apparently caused by almost contact shots. This is yet another proof that in the Ukraine war thing, it has first escaped. We are watching scenes of wild violence as recorded by the lens many years ago in Yugoslavia. Scenes that were then unprecedented and now repeated in Ukraine.
383	5	This video, of course, caused rage in Moscow and embarrassment in Kyiv. So far the Ukrainian authorities have not denied the unprecedented violence.
383	7	Every citizen of this country would also expect logically how this video should have been posted by every Greek informative website and would have been broadcast by all television stations as is the case and that should be the case with any barbarism recorded in this war.
383	9	However, with a few exceptions, the well -known Greek media have avoided dealing with the video in question. Obviously because - it is a blatant violation of every rule, every written or unwritten law. You do not torture with such coldness, you have been tied up if you do not deeply despise each side, every structural element of human life. Only the bloodthirsty Nazis, the Franco fascists in the Spanish civil war and the human waste of the Japanese imperial army are deservedly competed with such barbarism.
383	11	Obviously all this is not enough for those Greek media that are held in an arranged service, heard literally. But history is not written by "black holes" and "dark matter" sequences. It is written with events, recorded material, photographs and sounds. This is how Srebrenica's human sacrifice, or the tragedy of the Sarajevo market, the Hundreds of Vukovar and now all that human barbarism is recorded on the Ukraine fronts come to light. But we said. Some are found and will always be in an arranged service.
3830	1	Polakis publicly finds a trade unionist: 'You're complex and ideological putty' - discomfort in Koumoundourou
3830	3	Following his provocative posting in a post by Assistant Professor of Public Health Theodoros Lytra, where he once again "stroked" the antibiotics, SYRIZA MP Pavlos Polakis responded in an inappropriate manner to a post by Neurosurgeon Nice Hospital - Piraeus, Panos Papanikolaou, who accused SYRIZA of "bilingualism" on the issue of vaccines.
3830	5	Specifically, Mr Papanikolaou has sparked that SYRIZA's ambiguous attitude towards the effectiveness of vaccines is deliberate, with Alexis Tsipras' tolerance, as the opposition party does not want to "give the right".
3830	7	The SYRIZA MP did not take long to respond, and accused Mr Papanikolaou of "rinsing" Thanos Plevris and Mina Gaga, and did not fail to personally managed against him, describing the deep "complex and indescribable ideological"!
3830	9	The anti -vaccine response to ransom
3830	11	It is recalled that Pavlos Polakis, in a provocative position under the post of Professor Theodoros Lytra for his research on the ICU and the dead by coronavirus, caressed the anti -Volunteers once again, and was wondering why someone had to get sick after already vaccinated, since the vaccine "is terribly effective to protect against severe disease".
3830	13	"It didn't happen, it didn't succeed," Mr. Polakis said.
3830	15	Mr Lytras did not leave Mr Polakis' intervention unanswered, recalling that the role of the vaccine is to protect those who get sick of severe disease, and that even if some have severe symptoms, vaccinations who die are much less in relation to the unemployed.
3830	17	Discomfort in Koumoundourou, emptying by blonde
3830	19	P. Polakis' attitude once again brought SYRIZA to apologetic, as the government came into a difficult position after the publication of the second part of the research of teachers Lytra and Tsiodra about the mortality of the intubators inside and outside the ICU.
3830	21	"Kathimerini" speaks of discomfort in Koumoundourou's upper stages, which was not officially expressed by the leadership of the parliamentary group.
3830	23	However, he was the emptiness of his compatriot in Crete and a former "roommate" in the leadership of the Ministry of Health Andreas Xanthos.
3830	25	Mr Xanthos was triggered by Health Minister Thanos Plevris who, in his speech to the Parliament's Social Affairs Committee, called on SYRIZA to place Mr Polakis' internet confrontation with Professor Theodoros Lytra regarding his real conclusions.
3830	27	"The vaccines were protected by the heavy intelligence. Those who have been severely ill are unemployed. Mass scientific hysteria to vaccinate these ages. Say directly. Is this SYRIZA's position? " Mr Plevris said characteristically addressing the opposition. Reacting, Mr. Xanthos shouted from the benches "no! This is not the position of SYRIZA. We have said it a thousand times".
3831	1	What Erdogan hides and what he is seeking: The Ankara Girlfriend and Driva Analysis
3831	3	What does Erdogan seek? Does he want a "hot episode" to bring us pre -events? Is he trying to rewrite the Treaty of Lausanne? These questions by Nikos Hatzinikolaou responded by speaking to ANT1's central news release, Lieutenant General Ea. and former NATO commander, Christos Drivas and Professor and Analyst of ANT1's international issues, Konstantinos Filis.
3831	5	As they all show, Ankara provokes on a daily basis by insisting on incendiary rhetoric against Greece, thereby trying to lead things to uncontrolled situations.
3831	7	"Erdogan seeks to create a new accomplishment, now questioning the Treaty of Lausanne, wanting to review it. He is really seeking a warm episode, but to start with us and not him, "said Lieutenant General Christos Drivas.
3831	9	"In my estimation, Erdogan's first goal is Kastelorizo ​​and then reach the 25th meridian, so we have a default and unacceptable statements in the context of influence business to pass the Messter Messages to the world community, which are secondary to the Greek population. And most of all they want to exacerbate the Turks' mind. "
3831	11	"Stoltenberg's attitude" abhorrent "
3831	13	Mr Drivas said that Greece is in the best possible situation in terms of alliances, especially the US, which is our main ally, while at the same time expressing many questions about the attitude of the Secretary General. of NATO, Yen Stoldenberg, describing it as "disgusting".
3831	15	In fact, he stressed that Mr Stolndenberg is using a specific doctrine, which has the basic principle that the alliance is not mixed with the personal problems of the Member States. "He's trying to follow this line but he doesn't do it well. It uses the language of diplomacy in a bad way, NATO does not want to lose Turkey, not Erdogan, "Mr Drivas said.
3831	17	"Erdogan will not attempt a warm incident as in Imia"
3831	19	"It is obvious that Turkey, who has made the Lausanne Treaty in various places, not only in the Aegean, wants to review it. However, I do not believe that this will want to do so through a warm episode, if we can define it in the form that happened in Imia in 1996, because if he wanted to do so, he would have already attempted it. The international environment does not allow this, "said the ANT1 international analyst.
3831	21	"Erdogan de facto cannot ignore the partners and will weigh the data. However, if he tries to jump into the vacuum, here we are to deal with it, "Mr Filis concluded.
3832	1	Ukraine applied for NATO integration - the Russians "with the finger" in the nuclear
3832	3	Ukraine has applied for accession to NATO with urgent procedures in response to the announcement of the incorporation of the four Russian -speaking regions of Ukraine in Russia.
3832	5	This was stated by Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski in a video message earlier.
3832	7	This is a move of maximum escalation by Kyiv as if this request is accepted, an attack on the Ukrainian rest of the Ukraine controlling Kyiv will be considered an attack on NATO under Article 5 on a collective defense.
3832	9	As well as Kiev's attack on the areas that came to Russian territory, it will be considered by Russia as an attack by a NATO member state.
3832	11	As the Russian President himself has warned, Russia will use every means available to protect the areas incorporated therein.
3832	13	The worldwide scene is steadily setting step by step and no one knows who or what will stop it.
3832	15	Seven months after the start of business in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin incorporated Russia of the four Russian -speaking former Ukraine, Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporizia and Peninsula.
3832	17	V. Zelenzki's recorded message:
3832	19	As he says:
3832	21	"De Facto we have already reached NATO.
3832	23	De Facto we have already proven compliance with alliance standards. They are real for Ukraine - real on the battlefield and in all aspects of our interaction.
3832	25	We trust each other, we help each other and protect each other. This is an alliance.
3832	27	Today we are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for NATO in a faster way. "

3833	3	Another large increase in interest rates today (27/10/22) has been made by the European Central Bank with the aim of limiting uncontrolled inflation.
3833	5	The ECB's 25 -member board raised reference rates by three -quarters of the percentage percentage (0.75%), followed by a record increase last month and following the example of the US Federal Bank.
3833	7	Thus, the basic interest rate is 2% (from 1.25%), marginal funding rate at 2.25% (from 1.50%) and deposit rate at 1.50% (from 0.75% previously) .
3833	9	This means that overall, interest rates in the eurozone increase by two percentage points within three months. It marks the faster increase in interest rates in the history of the euro and raises questions about how far the ECB intends to reach under the threat of recession.
3833	11	It is noteworthy that an increase of such magnitude had made 18 months from 2005-2007 and 17 months in 1999-2000.
3833	13	"Inflation remains very high and will remain above our goal for a long time," ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters. Bank policymakers "are expecting to further raise interest rates to ensure the timely return of inflation" to the 2%target, he explained.
3833	15	Ms Lagarde pointed to the continued interest rates, despite the fact that the bank is expecting "further weakening this year and early next year".
3833	17	At the same time, the Board of Directors, at its present meeting, decided to take the first steps to reduce the ECB's balance sheet, which after the quantitative easing and cheap liquidity programs to be implemented in recent years has exceeded 8.8. Tris. euro.
3833	19	Central banks around the world raise interest rates that determine the cost of credit for businesses and consumers. Their aim is to stop galloping inflation powered by high energy prices, problems in the supply chain after pandemic and rejuvenation of demand for goods and services after relaxing restrictions on Covid-19.
3833	21	In the US, the Fed raised interest rates of 0.75% for the third consecutive time last month.
3833	23	Qualification in quarter was usually the rule for central banks. But this happened before inflation echoes 9.9% in the eurozone, supplied by the highest prices of gas and electricity after Russia's gas supply during the war in Ukraine.
3833	25	Inflation in the US is close to the high 40 years of 8.2%, partially fueled by the strongest growth and most pandemic support costs than in Europe.
3833	27	Some analysts provide half a unit increase in the last meeting of interest rates of the year in December and believe that the bank can stop after that.
3833	29	The ECB predicts inflation fall to 2.3% by the end of 2024.
3834	1	October 28th - Thessaloniki: They shone the Marder armor and the Rafale fighters - See videos and photos
3834	3	In the sky of Thessaloniki and the historic Spitfire MJ755 along with an Air Force F-16
3834	5	This year's military parade took place on Alexander the Great Avenue of Thessaloniki for the national anniversary of October 28, in the presence of the President of the Republic Katerina Sakellaropoulou.
3834	7	The eyes of about 20,000 spectators of the parade pulled, among other things, the newly acquired French -made Rafale fighter aircraft as well as armored Marder first -line vehicles.
3834	9	For the armored Marders, it was the first time they gave the "present" to a military parade in Greece as the first of them arrived in Greece 11 days ago, on October 17th.
3834	11	The Marder 1A3 TOMAs, which are received under the relevant agreement of our country with Germany, will be promoted to units of the 4th Army Corps, and in particular to Evros, as announced by Kyriakos Mitsotakis during a press interview with German Chancellor, Olf Saltz.
3834	13	Overall Greece is expected to receive 40 TOMA MARDER 1A3 to upgrade the remarkable of the Army Units, to increase their militant power, and to enhance the interoperability of the motor infantry units with those of the armor.
3834	15	Indicative of the value of the particular armor what the Honorable Chief of the General Staff, Michalis Costarakos, had written when it was decided to replace the old Soviet armored BMP-1 Tomas: "They deserve congratulations to the political and military leadership of the country, the Government, the Government And the GSF to the decision to replace the old Soviet (armored vehicles) BMP-1 Toma, a well-known limited operational value with later modern and reliable German MARDER TOMA, as well as the introduction of new German Tomas LYNX in the same role. The umbrella and the neglect of the motor infantry for many years, at last seem to end. The legendary Greek Infantry for its scary raids with foams, is now finally equipped with the right combat vehicles. "
3834	17	They tear down the skies rafale
3834	19	Equally impressive are the images of Rafale that have been joined by the Hellenic Air Force for a few months, and the common flight that made the legendary Spitfire MJ755 aircraft along with an Air Force F-16 were also special.
3834	22	It is recalled that the first six rafale to land in January at the 114th Battle Wing carry all the advanced equipment. AESA self -protection systems and electronic scan radar, which offers infinitely greater than today's fighter capabilities in the Air Force arsenal, and thus the comparative superior possibility of disclosing all potential targets.
3834	24	As protothema.gr had written then, an element of heavy importance is that the Rafale has weapons and missiles already using the Air Force Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft, in which a nucleus of flying is already initiated.
3834	26	One of the very critical elements that differentiates Rafale from any other fighter aircraft is at the service of the Greek Armed Forces or flying to allied Aeries east of the Aegean is the two engines, which offer very high "survival".
3834	28	They give the Rafale Action Ray over 1,000 miles from the take -off point, since their range (calculated on the route to the distant point of the mission and the distance to return to their base) reaches 2,800 miles.
3834	30	Given that fighter aircraft is a weapon carry platform, "winds of the wind", as the name Rafale translates into Greek, will have all the potential to guard the Greek skies and be able to identify all potential goals. The most basic arrow in the Rafale quiver is Meteor air-to-air missiles. With a range of more than 100 kilometers, Meteor will give the Rafale the opportunity to hit the opposing fighter aircraft long before they are threatened by them.
3835	1	The end of the neo -class domination of the left on Twitter: Elon Musk dismissed those who "silenced" N. Trump
3835	3	Billionaire Elon Musk made it clear that he wants to be his own twitter from the first moment, posting the phrase "the bird is now free" and dismissing censorships for former US President Donald Trump as well as They dared to express their views and were not liked in some world status.
3835	5	The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk is a global geopolitical event of great importance that deprives the centers of power that control western societies at the moment, the most important propaganda center, as Twitter in propaganda power has far exceeded television now regarded as now considered television. outdated medium.
3835	7	Everyone remembers a deliberate censorship operation for former President Trump to lose the election in 2020 that not only banned him from expressing his views but there was also an organized campaign of defamation by thousands of "trolls".
3835	9	The results are known. He has been elected (as elected) US president, T. Baiden and since then the planet has been plagued by a global financial crisis and has reached the brink of a nuclear war.
3835	11	The Elon Musk, Twitter, banned the free view of issues that disturbed extremist circles that control the Biden government and unfortunately the western centers of power, such as the issue of pandemic and mass blackmailing vaccinations, how N. Trump lost its elections. , the huge US responsibilities in the challenge of the Urkanian conflict, the "silence" of the Russians in expressing their own positions, etc.
3835	13	"The bird flies freely" means that everyone can "tweet" that it makes him happy.
3835	15	In essence, it means that former President N. Trump will be able to be a candidate again in the 2024 presidential election with his big weapon that is Twitter.
3835	17	His opponents knew that whatever they did to discredit N. Trump with organized attacks by the media, he would not have as much as he and his voters could "be".
3835	19	Already, thousands of users are posting "forbidden" up to previous messages such as: "Pedagogues are beasts and must receive the death penalty", "the 2020 elections were set up", "Ibermectin has excellent effects on the coronovation".
3835	21	So Elon Musk's first action was the instantly dismissal of Twitter Legal Adviser, Vijaya Gadde, who is responsible for suspending the account of former President Trump by the platform.
3835	23	At the Twitter executives meeting under the new owner if someone sees her face she probably knew what was waiting for her ... And mainly because she knew what she had done ...

3835	35	Users are now awaiting the return of Trump and hundreds of other persons whose accounts had been suspended because they were considered to violate the terms of use, but raised a number of reactions against the medium.

3835	45	Indeed, Vijaya Gadde, contrary to her "victims", will be able to post on Twitter and say that she ... descends, something that deprived thousands of people, and this is because Elon Musk believes (and rightly) in absolute freedom of speech.

3835	51	The new Twitter owner is believed to be re -allowing Russian media to express their own version of what is happening in Ukraine (as he is in favor of free expression and opinion) and already in the US (basically in Democrats and the Biden government) They have "bathing cold sweat" because they know how important the single propaganda is, which especially in the last two years has been successful as the collective unconscious of the masses is easily "planned" when it does not hear the other view.
3835	53	A few hours after launching a new era on Twitter Inc., the billionaire new platform owner was flooded with calls and requests from account holders excluded from the social media, and world leaders.
3835	55	Former US President Donald Trump, who has been permanently excluded from Twitter due to charges of motivating violence following the riots of January 6, 2021 in Capitol, welcomed the acquisition today, but said he would not return to Twitter.
3835	57	"I am very happy that Twitter is now in healthy hands and will not be governed by the Radical Left crazy who really hates our country," Truth Social wrote in a post on his own network.
3835	59	"I like Elon, but I remain in Truth," Trump later said in an interview with Fox News.
3835	61	Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current Vice President of the Russian Security Council, wrote his congratulations on Twitter:
3835	63	"Good luck, Elon Musk, in overcoming political prejudice and ideological dictatorship on Twitter. And abandon Starlink's business in Ukraine. "
3835	65	Others asked Musk to lift the penalties imposed by the social networking platform.
3835	67	In response to @Catturd2, an anonymous account with 852,000 followers, known as a major supporter of Trump's allegations of electoral fraud and who said he was excluded by many users, Musk wrote on Twitter: "I will deal more today."
3836	1	"Mice jump off the boat": As far as A. Georgiadis who had him in Maximou to laugh at K. Mitsotakis
3836	3	Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was responsible for the ND vice president and Minister of Development Adonis Georgiadis for the selection of A. Patsis on the ND ballot.
3836	5	As he characteristically he characteristically he was "badly chosen" and won a parliamentary headquarters with the ND.
3836	7	This means that he himself considers Mr Mitsotakis responsible for this choice.
3836	9	And it is noted that what A. Georgiadis says, his political positions, etc. They mentioned them in a joke in Maximus and to make even more cheerful videos on his shows to laugh (following a related video).
3836	11	You believe that the government of Mr. Mitsotakis in the Patsis scandal:
3836	13	- are innocent (4%, 674 votes)
3836	15	- He knew but was trying to interrupt his activity (8%, 1,250 votes)
3836	17	- is complicit and must resign (86%, 14,026 votes)
3836	19	- I don't know/don't answer (2%, 368 votes)
3836	21	Total votes: 16,318
3836	23	However, in order not to get tired, everyone in the ND knew everything about Patsis, he also made sure to announce it himself. After being deleted by the ND CO of ND due to the speculation scandal at the expense of thousands of borrowers and the one million euros that had been "pinched" by ELTA.
3836	25	"My party knew my activity," he said yesterday, which means that Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the New Democracy knew his activities with red loans and offshore companies he has already maintained since 2019!
3836	27	"Do you think a party doesn't know who he has on his ballots?" And he went on to say that his activities with offshore companies and the bleeding of citizens with red loans "was not a thunderbolt, nor did anyone discover America".
3836	29	Concerning today's statements by the ND vice -president and Minister of Development, journalists directly asked Mr Georgiades: "Did you know Mr Patsis' action all these years?"
3836	31	"The truth is that no, I did not know Mr Patsis' action, I do not know the personal professional of each ND MP, you will allow me. I did not know Mr Patsis' professional activity. If you asked me "what is Patsis?" I would call you a "lawyer". Until there I understood, "Mr Georgiadis argued.
3836	33	He even tried to avoid the obvious, as reporters noted him, who said "she owed your party to know" and that "you are the party's vice president," the journalists opposed. "Don't you think there is a responsibility in how ND chooses its candidates?"
3836	35	This is how Mr Georgiadis was forced to admit that "if Mr Patsis had this activity and before becoming a Member, he was very bad", referring to his own choices on his own vice -presidency in the party.
3836	37	At the same time he tried to "blur the waters", saying what is already known to not apply to red loans and the Patsis scandal.
3836	39	"If it got it 'on the way' it is something that the party didn't notice. He learned it, deleted it. " And his reporters "cut" it, reminding that "two years ago the issue came to the news". The ND vice president says he "not noticed" even Mr Patsis' course from law to engage and claim involvement in a series of regional PAEs, such as Larissa, Hercules, OFI, Panionios, but also Niki Volos with Niki Volos with the sharp rise and fall.
3836	41	Suppose he does not know Manolis Skoufalis' complaints that Andreas Patsis had threatened him with a weapon to solve his contract with Niki Volos.
3836	43	Apparently he lived in another "country" as everyone else in ND ...
3837	1	The Ministry of Culture gives large private businesses the "reasonable remuneration" of artists
3837	3	A few days ago a new bill incorporating Greek law in Greek law was put into public consultation (until 1 November) by the Ministry of Culture.
3837	5	The bill relates, inter alia, to the copyright of artists from the reasonable remuneration derived from audio or image or audio and image devices.
3837	7	Specifically, Article 43 of the Ministry of Culture's draft law consul etc.), of the reasonable remuneration of article 18 of Law 2121/1993 to the creators of the works for the private reproduction of their works.
3837	9	The reaction from both copyright and opposition collective management organizations was immediate.
3837	11	As the SYRIZA Culture of Culture Sia Anagnostopoulou typically states: “The Ministry of Culture gives a gift to three - four large companies Article 43 of the Copyright Law Conspire Thousands of creators and beneficiaries.
3837	13	Once again, the Ministry of Culture, with a continuous war against culture, is trying to add an article to a draft law of the European Union's copyright from the copyright of Greek beneficiaries. , what concerns the "reasonable remuneration". "
3837	15	To date, what is true of the obligation to pay copyright to the creators is that importers and producers are required to pay a "reasonable remuneration" for all technical means and devices available to individuals, as well as businesses/professionals, as These are used for reproduction for private use, either directly or after their disposal at those entrepreneurs to individuals.
3837	17	The new Article 43 attempts to fully abolish the reasonable remuneration in favor of the beneficiaries. As of January 1, 2023, the right to importers and producers are granted not to include most of the devices and technical means that they import or produce, simply on the pretext of selling them to legal entities, characterizing them as professional. .
3837	19	"The Ministry of Culture and the Minister Mrs. Mendoni, by obviously supporting the interests of large companies, not only deducts the reasonable remuneration by reducing more than 60% of beneficiaries' compensation, but circumvents Greek and European legislation, the firm relevant case law of the Greek courts, the WEU, and his decision. Supreme Court (No. 2097/2013) that characterizes the provision of Article 43 legally incorrect.
3837	21	The Ministry of Culture's tactic to close the big businesses, offering them the ability to escape their obligations with a simple responsible statement, as well as the consistent tactic of closing doors and ears to the critical problems of people in culture, will not continue. "Sia Anagnostopoulou commented, asking the Ministry of Culture to immediately withdraw Article 43 because if it is voted on" it will mean the most unequal treatment and redistribution in three - four large companies, on the backs of thousands of creators and beneficiaries ".
3837	23	For its part, the Copyright Collective Management Organization, EDEM, comments:
3837	25	"The provision of Article 43 of the new bill is given the right of importers and producers from 1.1.2023 to not include most of the devices and technical means that import or produce, on the grounds that they are intended for their responsible statements. professional use.
3837	27	This provision consistently disrupts the payment system to the collective management organizations of the reasonable remuneration of article 18 of Law 2121/1993. If in force, it will cause a large reduction in the rights received by spiritual creators from reasonable remuneration.
3837	29	EDEM, in collaboration with all collective management organizations, will use all its institutional and legal means to retire this provision that attempts to overthrow those who have been in force in Greece and internationally to the right of reasonable remuneration. creators. "
3838	1	Nikos Androulakis for October 28: Compassing of Responsibility and National Dignity
3838	3	"The epic of the 40s is a timeless symbol of sacrifice for the homeland," PASOK KINAL President Nikos Androulakis said in his message on the anniversary of October 28th.
3838	5	Nikos Androulakis adds that "in the present age of geopolitical unrest and great uncertainty we must work to strengthen the country's position in economic and social terms within the European Union, but also with a sense of unity to safeguard our national interests in every kind of revisionism and especially the provocative Turkish leadership.
3838	7	Every dialogue must be based on international law and not on the law of the powerful. That is why when some question international treaties by undermining stability in the Southeast Mediterranean, they do not fit equal distances from partners or NATO leadership. Not even new arrangements for equipment programs. The sacrifice of the Greeks in the Epic of '40s will be a compass of responsibility and national dignity for all of us over time. Happy birthday to all Greek women and all Greeks. "
3839	1	Student Parade in Athens -The statements of officials
3839	3	The state's debt to teach the younger generation the glorious past of the country was mentioned by the Minister of Education and Religions, Niki Kerameos, in her statements after the student parade in downtown Athens.
3839	5	The student parade in Athens was completed with brilliance and applause.
3839	7	"With great pride and emotion we watched our children, students and students, marching by honoring this historic day. On the day of the Great "NO" against the invader, the day we honor the struggle against fascism and Nazism, the struggle of our ancestors to be all of us today, "Niki Kerameos said.
3839	9	Kerameos, Patoulis, Bakoyannis, at the parade
3839	11	"It is our duty to teach our children the glorious past, to teach them how much our ancestors have fought to be free today. Teaching exactly the glorious past, we are pursuing a better present and we envision an even more promising future, "concluded Mrs Kerameos.
3839	13	For his part, Attica Regional Governor George Patoulis emphasized: "Eighty -two years have passed through the great, historical NO of Greece to the conquerors. The same will not say it whenever it is needed again, because we have our proud army, but above all our young people, who know - and proved it with today's parade - to be close to values ​​but mainly with pride against our ancestors , who were sacrificed to be free. "
3839	15	The Mayor of Athens, Costas Bakoyannis, in his statements, spoke of a "generation to generation relay" that emphasizes what unites us. "Joy, excitement, emotion and pride for the children who have today parade and kept the flag high," Mr Bakoyannis said, adding: "It is a generation to generation, it turns out to be in practice that all that unites us is very much. More than those few that separate us. "
384	1	Some women 'just' will lose their lives
384	2	Women's lives can wait, sacrificed or crush on an institutional, systemic and personal level, as has been the case now.
384	4	"HESSOS was breastfed and fell asleep, but I touched my back on the wall and waited for dawn. I am learning English, I thought. I promoted all the English I knew with my mind. Court [...] Hamburger, Pambers, how much he does, fuck them. "
384	6	The recent ruling by the US Supreme Court that overthrew the constitutional protection of the right to abortion paved the way for its upcoming restriction. Dobbs marks a black, over -conservative page in the history of the Supreme Court and made me look for Lucia Berlin's short story from which the original phrase.
384	8	The short story is called Mijito and is one of the many of the collection instructions for domestic assistants where we meet women who slip into the US hole net net in the US. Women who cannot buy their baby's diapers, talk broken English about the utterly necessary phrases of life ("fuck them"), alcoholic alcohols, gynecologists, gynecologists, moms or daughters.
384	10	These nightmares 'care' rooms of Berlin's heroes who speak Spanish and fall asleep on their child from overwork I was thinking these days.
384	12	Even if we are not poor cleaners in Texas, we can mentally travel the distance between our lives and their own and we are obliged to rise because we are not distant to all this magnificent campaign against women's bodies.
384	13	Lives will be lost or will be lost with the ban on abortions. They will have children people who do not want them or who cannot raise them. Dreams and hopes will be destroyed by youthful errors or an incident of abuse, and women or their lives will lose their health or life with complications in pregnancy.
384	15	Who is affected when the law prohibits something that citizens consider necessary? Those who cannot go elsewhere or pay to obtain it, according to a classic argument against excessive state intervention.
384	17	We are watching a clear attack on the poor and the unemployed, those who do not speak English, are not white or who have no support and social surroundings. These will not be able to end their pregnancy safely. They will resort to home treatments, Kompogiannites, internet tips and nightmarish doctors who, naively, we thought they had no place in one of the largest economies in the world.
384	19	The gap deepens. On the one hand, elite universities with cutting -edge research (and on medical matters), the wealthy California hippies who will not (hope!) Rights will be released, white rich, overdamingly paid in the black market to get rid of them to get rid of 'their pregnancy. On the other hand, the consumables, the deprived of any insurance, care or confidence, the documented in their homes and their families, those who, if encountered in a medical problem in pregnancy, should literally be sacrificed.
384	21	Little the bad. Women are. Their sacrifice is their story. And the story is a source of convincing, supposedly legal arguments, at least in the current hyper -conservative composition of the court.
384	23	This defeat of rights in the US concerns us. The idea of ​​"freedom" gaining ground is something greedy that is gunpowder and reminiscent of Trump. What does this freedom have to do (and how did the word come down?) With the idea of ​​freedom that made so many people worldwide, from Tockel's years, to look to America to raise arguments in favor of organizing societies with emphasis on rights. ;
384	25	For several years we have heard that some things are solved and obsolete. "People go from good to better" - especially Western! It is necessary for a specific degree of privilege, in order to be surprised that the world is not flexible and "doomed" to constant improvement.
384	27	Such blindness presupposes that you have not seen your body become a source of claims for others. Even if we are not poor cleaners in Texas, we can mentally travel the distance between our lives and their own and we are obliged to rise because we are not distant to all this magnificent campaign against women's bodies. It is aspects of the unmistakable idea that we are not entitled to choose our lives.
384	29	Women's lives can wait, sacrificed or crush on an institutional, systemic and personal level, as has been the case now.
3840	1	New Akar attack: Greece is the expansive country
3840	3	"They accuse Turkey of expanding. What is really expanding is Greece itself, which has entered our nose since the day it was founded and constantly causing and threatening Turkey, "said Hulusi Akar, causing once again.
3840	5	A new attack on Greece was made by Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar from the inauguration of the Defense Exhibition, Aerospace and Space Industry Saha Expo. He said: "While we approach problems with peaceful solutions, some well-known Greek politicians devised a doctrine called neo-Ottomanism to cover their own dreams of the Great Idea.
3840	7	They accuse Turkey of expanding. What is really expanding is Greece itself, which has entered our nose since the day it was founded and constantly causing and threatening Turkey. "
3840	9	Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar noted that "we have always respected the borders and sovereign rights of all our neighbors and continue to do so. Our only goal is to ensure the security of our country and our nation. Our expectation from our neighbors is to behave with reason and prudence and to respect our sovereign rights on the basis of international law. Despite provocative actions and rhetoric, we always make great efforts to keep the channels of dialogue open with our neighbor Greece and always tend our hand to peace for stability in our region. While we approach the problems by trying to find peaceful solutions. "
3840	11	Hulusi Akar said that "these politicians, in their statements, are causing great damage to the Greek people. They also sabotage and destroy the way to peace and dialogue between the two countries. Despite the positions of Greek politicians who have nothing to do with reality, nor with mathematics, logic and laws, we continue under the leadership of our President to try for peace and prosperity, as well as making the Aegean And in the Mediterranean a sea of ​​friendship, where all their wealth will be shared fairly. However…".
3841	1	Ministry of Digital Governance: Greece is changing with works, not with mud
3841	3	Answer to a statement by the Digital Governance Division of SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance K. Katsis:
3841	5	On the occasion of today's announcement by the SYRIZA-Digital Digital Governance Division, Mr Katsis, based on a report by the Editors' newspaper and concerns the Associations of Information Society SA, a supervised body of the Ministry of Digital Government, the following:
3841	7	The Journal of Editors reintroduces an issue that has already been answered recently to its author's question. As has already been emphasized, direct assignments by the Ministry of Digital Governance are less than 2% of the total budget of the Ministry's projects and its supervised bodies.
3841	9	These assignments basically relate to either platforms that constitute Gov.gr services, which are added daily to the single digital portal aimed at facilitating the citizen, or special needs of the COVID-19 era, which had to be implemented within a few weeks. , such as the country's vaccination platform. Especially for the latter, the comments are superfluous. The experience of every Greek and the lives that were saved thanks to the business "Freedom" speaks. It is also clear that in all the procedures, the existing legislation, namely Law 4412/2016, which SYRIZA introduced, was admitted to all the procedures.
3841	11	For years, in Greece, digital transformation was dramatically delayed. We received a country that measured only 8.8 million citizens' digital transactions with the Greek State in 2018, a figure that will reach 1 billion in 2022. This is done through the great reform of Gov.gr and the 1471 services and relevant platforms so far contained, many of which are delivered projects of these assignments. As every citizen may find, the annual performance in the number of digital transactions of 2018 today is held in about four days.
3841	13	Finally, on the political substance, SYRIZA's targeting is clear: Daily - now - mud in the fan with the aim of obtaining the completion of a large project for the benefit of citizens, this digital reform of the state. It is clearly undermining the opposition, so that the work of the Ministry of Digital Governance can be discredited in the pre -election, a vain and doomed goal of failing to fail. The experience of improving the service of every citizen is an experience of Greek society and the conquest of all Greeks regardless of political beliefs.
3841	15	In the face of the constant, increasing and guided spilning efforts, we respond primarily to our work. There are those who build and those who tear down. We belong to the former, SYRIZA chose to belong to the latter.

3844	1	SYRIZA - MS: Determines Mitsotakis Optimism after meeting with Saltz
3844	3	With 8 rhetorical questions, SYRIZA - MS commented on the meeting of Kyriakos Mitsotakis with the German Chancellor Saltz, completely rejecting the Prime Minister's optimism. As the Officer Opposition notes, "the BMP 1 armor are withdrawn from the islands without replacement and Mr Mitsotakis is much more optimistic."
3844	5	Specifically, SYRIZA-PS stresses that "Mr Mitsotakis said today that he is" very optimistic "after meeting with Chancellor Saltz. Really where does this optimism come from?
3844	7	In his announcement, SYRIZA-PS commented in an ironic style the "optimism" that the prime minister saw during his contacts with the German Chancellor, while highlighting what Mr Mitsotakis said about the armor, but not with the islands, but They are replaced, a matter for which Ankara has been pushing for some time.
3844	9	In detail the announcement of the SYRIZA Press Office-Progressive Alliance:
3844	11	"The BMP 1 armor are withdrawn from the islands without replacement and Mr. Mitsotakis declares much more optimistic
3844	13	Mr Mitsotakis said today that he was "very optimistic" after meeting with Chancellor Saltz.
3844	15	Really where does this optimism come from?
3844	17	- From the fact that Germany does not accept no Eurobonds and common lending for a brave crisis response program, but not even a ceiling on energy prices?
3844	19	- From the fact that, instead of the Marder armored vehicles replacing the BMP1s withdrawn from the islands, will they be placed in Evros?
3844	21	- From the fact that Germany is confined to general and self -evident statements about Turkish aggression without any condemnation but not even a neighbor's criticism?
3844	23	- From the straightforward composition of the German Chancellor "not to make comparisons between the Ukrainian and the Eastern Mediterranean"?
3844	25	- From Germany's study to sell underwater to Turkey?
3844	27	-From the German Chancellor's apostate for refugees, a fair agreement on immigration and asylum or at least for tooling by Turkey?
3844	29	- From Germany's insistence from excluding Greece from international conferences on Libya while one Turkish -bodied agreement succeeds the other?
3844	31	- Or, after all, the fact that the only Greek-German debate is on Ukraine's equipment and not for an initiative of peace and ending the Russian invasion of Draghi's standards? "
3844	33	Other words to be loved by ND.
3844	35	With the well-known "other words to love", and obvious embarrassment in the face of the questions raised, the New Democracy characterizes SYRIZA-PS's announcement "for domestic consumption"
3844	37	As he says, 2014 "Go Back Madame Merkel" became "Go Back Mister Scholz" in 2022. As if a day was not passed. All this for the inner audience. Because in Europe they boast about their participation as observers in European Socialists and show good conduct to become equal members with Mr Saltz and his counterparts. "
3845	1	Trolls
3845	3	The deletion was all over, and the deletion recognizes it. But the way he defends himself, the arguments he uses, the flying nails, and even his trolls, concentrate all the pathogens of the immortal Greek race.
3845	5	First of all the classic "I didn't know". I was stopped by traffic because I was running at an excessive speed and I was justified that I didn't know the limit was 80 kilometers. I get into the bus without a mask and check that I didn't know I had to wear it. I am a lawyer, but I did not know that it is incompatible for a MP to participate in an offshore company. "And no one got me a phone to tell me, you know something, that's not to be so."
3845	7	The next line of defense is "Okay, I'm not yesterday, all of Greece knew my action". Now you woke up? Did I get on the ballots alone? Didn't you know what you pretend to be shocked today? Don't you, or, in any case, wouldn't you want to do it? In other words, you would not want to take advantage of your position to get from a bank loan not justified by your income and then, thanks to your same position, to buy from the same bank red loans at 1/15 of their value?
3845	9	Somewhere the necessary self -criticism is involved. Ok, I might have been wrong. I may have forgotten to mention where you found my 4 million. Will you cross me? I did it on purpose; To help I wanted. To inherit two companies to my children I wanted. "If the doubt in my political path is this, let it be ...".
3845	11	But the key is that I am deeply person and I care about my fellow citizens. As an independent, I will not have any party work. That is why I do not deliver my headquarters for the good of the Grevena, because the one who succeeds me may not care so much. "Until the last minute I'll be Andreas you know."
3845	13	In all of this, of course, there are truths. It's not like the other who says he didn't know he was raping twelve years, he thought he was raping sixteen years. When Andreas Patsis argues that everyone knew, he implies that complaints had been made, questions had been made, there were reports, but no one was sweaty. When he says he did not enter the ballot alone, he means that a party official should have controlled him, dust off his activities, distinguish what is legal and moral and warned him. When he admits that he was well deleted but at the same time he holds his headquarters, he confirms that terrorism is a constituent element of Greek political life.
3846	1	Nikos Paraskevopoulos: Technical University - The Restore Policy
3846	3	The marches of the Technical University are no longer iron -branded. Not because the protesters are armored. Weapons and fences are not inside, but around them. Thousands of police officers will wear armor (some of them would at the same time prefer the position of the demonstrator), there will be old -fashioned tear gas, more modern chemicals and flash clicks, auras, motorcycles, drones, helicopters.
3846	5	Who do they all face? Not the provocateurs, of course,: their action, always dangerous and indifferent to impact on the whole, is controlled in a personalized manner. The forces of the repression put the anonymous young demonstrator against them and next to him some tired but proud of distant. Usually poor, willing to risk them to change their terms of life. These are the frightening for every oligarchy.
3846	7	New pages are written every year in the history of the Polytechnic. On the cover is the photo of the 1973 uprising. The massive and enthusiastic marches are followed by the 90s, but stigmatized by bloody episodes of repression (with its victims Koumi, Kanellopoulou, Kalteza). The sequel was rather straight, with the number of protesters constant and the number of guards increasing. But in recent years the pulse has been re -eating, something is obvious: the yeast of self -denial and mass claim always remains on the marches.
3846	9	The fluctuation of collective protest mobilizations was international. The beginning of the 2000s was marked by mass terrorist blows to the Twin Towers and in European Metropolitan Centers. People were scared, terrorism objectively functioned as provocations, the population of demonstrations diluted. On the contrary, policing, already after the major demonstrations in Satiles, USA in 1999, was served on a rapid modernization of organization and equipment, in particular surveillance.
3846	11	But the need for the majority to express and claim equality and rights demonstrating is lime. Some do not understand it why they are opposite, forces or barbs or apologists. For others today two thoughts.
3846	13	The above are scattered indelible images of the dynamics of demonstrations. But among the first paths for the Technical University and today's "eyes" another historical change. In the beginning, politics was a request. The House, the Temple of the Republic. The parties had been hunted by the junta, they were missing, their flags and the symbols were now lifting and scattering feelings of freedom and joy in the world. Today things have almost come upside down. Among those who are demonstrating those who, unemployed, difficult, revolutionaries who - at best - are still looking for it, are kept out of all confidence and every assessment in politics, see politicians as puppets, other crude other jokes.
3846	15	Of course I understand them and I see the vain of doctrines. It was time for the lessons, and then I avoided the minds. A few words only here, the transfer of an experience from a brief passage from the field of political power. Maybe to others it looks useful.
3846	17	A complaint is fruitless if there is nothing else to put in the position of the one we denounce. Given, you can't change the world alone, but there are others around with dreams, plans and hopes. If we are indifferent to democracy, the alternative is the oligarchy, with its minions of neoliberalism and the far -right. What we saw before it was the surface of the mud, the seabed and the drowning are below, waiting for those who are left without ideas and ways of struggle. Social peace, human rights, the earth with its green, are now needed to build a new policy, education and air of justice.

3847	1	Rubicon tricks at Georgiadis' house - accuses SYRIZA
3847	3	Intervention by members of Rubicon with tricks took place on Thursday night outside Add's house. Georgiadis.
3847	5	The news was announced by the Minister of Development by posting on his Twitter account, which he accompanied with a series of photos from the spot.
3847	7	However, although the tricks were signed by Rubicon, Mr. Georgiadis threw responsibility for SYRIZA. In particular, he wrote that such attacks come "whenever he says something that bothers Alexis Tsipras".
3847	9	"A strange thing whenever I say something that bothers Alexis Tsipras comes to Rubicon and attacks my house with my kids inside ... Ba coincidence will be SYRIZA definitely condemns the attack on my house I am sure ... Kids we are not afraid to know ", he wrote in his post.
3847	11	The intervention of the government spokesman, Yiannis Economou, was immediate, describing Rubicon's members as a "trumpet", while stressing that he was expecting the condemnation of the attack by all political forces.
3847	13	"Not long ago at the home of the Minister of Development, Adonis Georgiadis, while his children were at home, Rubicon's bullies attacked. . Clean and absolutely, "Mr Economou said.

3848	3	"The Technical University lives in today's struggles and continues to bother," said SYRIZA-PS spokesman Nassos Iliopoulos in an interview with the Red 105.5 FM radio station, discussing today's anniversary of the uprising.
3848	5	"Democracy is always a source of tension, conflict. The world that enters these conflicts, in order to claim rights, freedom, pride, always need some "anchors". And the Technical University is one of the most stable such anchors, "he said.
3848	7	"It is important that the Technical University always maintains all the ..." right "enemies," added Nassos Iliopoulos.
3848	9	"The Technical University continues to cause anger, embarrassment, irritation in the conservative line. One main reason is that historical moments like these are moments of pride for the people. No matter how much a particular narrative wants to show that the junta has fallen from its own internal contradictions, we know that the point of breaking is that the tolerance of Greek society has stopped. And the expression of this thing was the Technical University, "Nassos Iliopoulos stressed.
3848	11	"In every season and in every generation, there is the different raw material that supplies important kinematic events," he said.
3848	13	"Today a policy is dominated by the looting of society and this in terms of everyday life," he said, referring to the image of the internet, which shows infant milk on a supermarket shelf, "tied" with an anti -theft system.
3848	15	"Mr. Georgiadis told us that this is normal. However, what is not normal at all is to have a family that is unable to pay milk for her baby today. And based on the data we have, while poverty has declined by 2019, in the last three years poverty in Greece has been growing, ”said Nassos Iliopoulos.
3848	17	He also said that the index of unseen health needs is deteriorating: "This '19 index was at 8%, today it is approaching 30%, more than 1 in 4 citizens have health issues that they cannot deal with."
3848	19	Concerning the issues of the Republic, Nassos Iliopoulos noted: "Progressive government with SYRIZA-PS means that this first days of government will end this story with MAT at universities and university police."
3848	21	"Democracy is not a luxury," he said.

385	1	The treatment of Alan Tring
385	2	The easy pink sympathy that those who/those who put in June put the colorful flag on everything should not overshadow the violence in the lives of queer people.
385	4	If I have to choose a queer idol, I choose Alan Turing. The easy pink sympathy that those who/those who put in June put the colorful flag on everything should not overshadow the violence in the lives of queer people. Women in our country can easily perceive this, as they exist the same murderous violence.
385	6	Turing was a victim of an unfair law pursuing sexual acts (we would say: "preliminary") between men in Britain. Similar provisions had almost all legal classes until recently. Both Germany and Greece, for example, had foreseen in their criminal code for the "nature of insight" between men.
385	10	One argument that was often promoted when one demanded the abolition of such provisions was that these laws were not often implemented, but had fallen into useless. Funny argument, because frequency does not remove injustice. And the only existence of such provisions, where they existed or still exist, is a blow to the law.
385	12	In our country just this year, the conversion treatments were banned and the blood donation was allowed by gay boys. The unfair and inappropriate link between disease-sexuality has not been completely eliminated.
385	13	Turing (1912-1954) was a prominent mathematician and pioneer of computer science. His work has determined the evolution of what we now call "computer" and "algorithm", while his services during World War II in the field of enemy messages decoded were films, books and graphic novels. In 1935, he laid the foundations of modern computer theory. He liked to run, he was a runner. It is considered a dad (to a nice patriarchal expression) of artificial intelligence.
385	15	The great historian Hobsbaum in his massive work The era of the limbs (history of 1914-1991) dedicates some pages to Turing. It was probably a curious guy. Hobsbaum talks about a pale young man who did not look particularly look, although he then became "some kind of idol for homosexuals".
385	17	Hobsbaum is not limited to the irony of Turing's insignificant appearance, but admits that no one in Cambridge at that time had taken the cosmogenic changes that took place within the small mathematics dormitory. The historian admits that in the beer the geniuses of mathematical logic did not open him. Not that he was indifferent (only for a lack of curiosity no one can blame him!), But probably the drunken mathematicians believed he wouldn't even understand what the problem that tormented them.
385	19	The incomprehensible results of Turning's research, however, have found an early implementation to new technologies. He was philosophically involved with the human brain and its function. Many of what we are now discussing about the prevalence of artificial intelligence or the connection of human and artificial intelligence are diminishing the runner-mathematics.
385	21	Turing was condemned to a twelve -month "cure" for his homosexual tendencies, which meant the end of his career in national security, since homosexuals were then regarded by nature enemies of the state. The idea behind the criminalization of behavior was that feminine bearing is a disease that is cured. Even on this basis, compulsory hormone therapy sounds a brutal practice. Chemical therapy upset the mathematician hormones, which eventually committed suicide in 1954. Some argue that it was accidentally poisoned by research.
385	23	Unjust laws are destroying people's lives. If one thinks about what Turning could have offered to mankind if he lived for another thirty years, his loss is even more tragic. Would he continue to decode the secrets of machines and living organisms (his field of research in the last years of his life)? Where would the artificial intelligence have arrived if he had been allowed to live as a "silly" researcher at a quiet college in Provincial England?
385	25	In our country just this year, the conversion treatments were banned and the blood donation was allowed by gay boys. The unfair and inappropriate link between disease-sexuality has not been completely eliminated. With the appearance of monkeys, some people have again linked illness and sexuality, expressing their own morbid mind rather than concerns about public health. But the world is changing. Now is the time of the Turing.
3850	1	Christos Stylianidis is alleged to take part in a far -right panel in Poland
3850	3	According to a report by Dimitris Angelidis at Ef.
3850	5	"Mystery" is how his name was found in the publicized list of conference speakers co -organized tomorrow in Tyne, Poland, the Euro -European Eurogroup of European Conservatives and Reformers, which belongs to the far -right party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Greek Prime Minister Giorgia Other extreme conservative and far -right parties in Europe.

3851	1	Why are Greeks a superior nation
3851	3	The Turks asked for hospitalization from the Greek woman who was wounded by the bomb in Istiklal for her care in a hospital in Constantinople! - Was the "thank you" for boosting the Turkish economy by thousands of our compatriots - Was there ever a Greek case to charge medical expenses to a visitor to our country?
3851	5	These are the Turks. This is Turkey. Of course, the victims of the bomb attack in Constantinople are also in the international sympathy. But it seems that only within Turkey are not treated with sympathy. Proof, the fact that the wounded of the explosion reported to Turkish hospitals are requested to pay for hospitalization. Anger causes this revelation. The 39 -year -old Greek father who was wounded during the explosion revealed it on a television station: "I was told that they would make her an epidural to do the surgery, which will be charged, as she will be charged and hospitalized." His reaction was to expect: "I told them that he was an unacceptable foreign national who fell victim to a terrorist attack, not to accept the medical care he should."
3851	7	Would this ever happen in Greece? Would it be Greek, formal or informal, not to rush to treat injured? Not just a victim of terrorist activity. Victim of any form of attack or accident. All the more so when this injured person is a visitor to Greece. Each of us feels an obligation to him because he considers himself a host. It is ancient the tradition that requires the Greeks to consider the foreign person a sanctuary. Teller under the protection of Xeni Zeus. What to explain about them to the Turks? They only see the wallets of their country's visitors, the content of which they seek to distract through slavery. No relationship between the innate courtesy of the Greek, which coexists with a proud dignity, and the inappropriate behavior of Erdogan's compatriots. He also emphasizes the fact that the money they receive from Turkey's visitors respect. And when they are victims of terrorism, which are solely responsible for the Turkish state, which has failed to protect them, they are asking them to pay their hospitalization expenses.
3851	9	There it turns out that Greeks are a superior nation. Not only to visitors, but also to every distressed, medical care is provided in our country. Uninsured, immigrants, members of "social minorities", everyone is accepted in our hospitals. Sometimes and at the expense of Greek taxpayers and insured who pay the cost of hospitals.
3851	11	Of course, one thinks that one cannot expect such generosity from Asia fanatics. Who know that their visitors have nothing to do with their own. Christian monuments and ancient Greek antiquities go to see tourists in Constantinople and Asia Minor. And the crescent is still in their flag "stolen". Symbol of the goddess Artemis, protector of the Grand, old Byzantine colonies. What to respect and what to appreciate?
3851	13	Otherwise, even for the acceptance of condolences from Greece and the US, their behavior was unacceptable! Erdogan had to meet with Biden and raise the issue of the F-16 fighters to accept the condolences ...
3851	15	But this attitude is also pre -emptive. Because Erdogan himself, in his psyche, is no different from the average Turk. Who does not see the failure of his state and his security services. It blames the responsibilities elsewhere. And he always makes the Greeks. It is noteworthy that the Greek correspondent of Open TV station Maria Zacharakis was adopted. Suffice it to quote her story: "I was detained last night because I am a Greek woman and I was at the scene of the attack. As I end my response, my live show last night, many people approached the journalists. A Turk approaches me and asks me "where are you from what country?" I answer "Greece", and he started to tell me "constantly in Greece who support the PKK, you are from behind". "And I saw," he tells me without understanding Greek, "with how much joy you went on the news. You are happy with what happened in Turkey. " I was not answering him, and he kept saying, "Of course you don't answer, because you and your country are guilty of this story."
3851	17	The only guilty, of course, here is Turkey itself, the country of oppressor, an invader and a dismantler of international legality.

3854	1	SUPPLY - G. TSIPRAS - Salvation Plain with "Burns" in Defense
3854	3	SYRIZA searches for the policies with national defense and the Armed Forces, after SYRIZA, after the resurrected strikes in the opposition narrative brought about by the public divergence from the party line of three executives.
3854	5	Following the bowling of the French ambassador for the abolition of the mutual defense agreement, in the SYRIZA election blender, the ... "girls" whom thirty members of his parliamentary group, led by the party's defense department, were added. Directorate -General for Defense Equipment and Investment.
3854	7	The effort of SYRIZA's shadow "Minister of Defense" is obviously aimed at giving a political pulse to party strategy. Strategy, according to majority officials, is crushed in the millstones of communication herself and the introduction of the government's public sphere of the government's legislative initiative for the EYP.
3854	9	With this pursuit in the blue reading it comes forward to the lists of surveillance. In the timely question to the Minister of National Defense, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, Mr. George Tsipras is recruiting a imaginative as well as politically, lacking, documentation.
3854	11	The opposition defense department argues that the list including the names of the Deputy Minister of National Defense Nikos Chardalia and the Director of the Directorate -General for Defense Equipment and Investment (GDEEE), Vice Admiral Aristidis, but not by other reports from . The SYRIZA executive who is charged with nationally, unthinkable, averses such as the defense of the country that is "not an end in itself" or that the 2020 record in Evros did not concern the invasion of immigrants but "mass entry" reaches the point of raises "issues of national security and possible espionage".
3854	13	In this effort, the SYRIZA MP, who has not hesitated to succeed against a Financial Times columnist publicly formulating the unmistakable accusation that the writing of a bitter report on Greece was under the influence of drugs, manages to put another politician.
3854	15	George Tsipras cites Nikos Panagiotopoulos' reference to "Swiss cheese", forgetting that it was the answer to the unprecedented move by SYRIZA, to present the arrangement of forces on an Aegean island with the invocation of the Greek Army.
3854	17	The political press found by the SYRIZA MP is based on the finding that the Ministry of National Defense has not made any announcement on the publication. He concludes that "neither seems to have initiated processes of verification", ignoring the way the Armed Forces operate.
3854	19	Including this timely question to parliamentary control will be a good opportunity to explain the opposition. Mostly for the threats that SYRIZA will blow up a national success such as the mutual defense agreement with France if there is no Greek added value.
3854	21	And in this context, will George Tsipras be called upon to answer if France does not agree, does this mean that the other Rafale fighter or that the Belharra frigates will not be half -regulated in shipyards?
3855	1	What will the popular (intra -party) right?
3855	3	Yes, it is true that Kyriakos does not have the whole ND with him. The so -called folk or karamanic right, never digested him. Even when for a sufficient time they were not obstructed or made statements that questioned him or undermined him directly (as he begins to do now), his representatives never hid their dislike in his face. What to do, so structured the big multi -lecture parties. Have portions and trenches inside them.
3855	5	After all, let's be fair. And when the neo-democratic party leadership belonged to the Karamanlian or populist wing, the center and a mits of the executives and followers did the same. Papandreikos, and especially the Semitic PASOK, have lived through four years of glory and political hegemony, because the ND's center and Mitsotakian wing showed no particular zeal in defending their party trenches. They easily adopted an attitude that ultimately was politically different towards the opponent camp.
3855	7	So what we are now starting to see, that is, a piece of ND grabbing the spy of the espionage and using it as- by the way- morality to fully identify with SYRIZA's strategy was more or less expected. If it weren't for the spy, it would be something else. He had arrived at the time of time to unfold their talent, before the election they would try to scare Mitsotakis.
3855	9	The problem with the original- right- right, is that they are moving in a political air. Firstly because they do not have a leader, a personality that could replace the one who does not digest. Secondly, they pretend that they do not understand the strategic importance of central voters, who are expelled from the ND with their tactics. Third, they forget historical lessons of their own party past. Whenever the Right was forced, the center was called to rescue it. This happened a few years ago, to repeat "they do not do us, they are distorted" that we see today.
3855	11	Fourth and more important (in today's juncture), they do not realize that with a policy that is directly undermining and smoking Kyriakos, they will gain a strategic identification with SYRIZA. So they will follow him both in victory and his defeat. SYRIZA's greatest problem will be that he will be found without a narrative in the repetitive elections, even if Kyriakos will be first with a vote (which will be much more). In this case, the intra -party popular right, what narrative will employ in the second battle as a SYRIZA watch? I am talking about this battle in which Kyriakos will be completely dominant. Will she say "sorry wrong" or will she undermine her choices unquestionable?
3856	1	Does the President work for us?
3856	3	The country's journalistic associations have called for the President of the Republic's intervention in the scandal of surveillance.
3856	5	If Ms. Sakellaropoulou wanted to lift the true height of her office, she had the opportunity- not to say the obligation.
3856	7	But he reacted as the last responsible bureaucrat: "I have been placed in principle and clearly in the context of my constitution and the case is now before the judicial authorities."
3856	9	The "position" took place on… September 21, when PASOK President Nikos Androulakis visited her - for his own case.
3856	11	Since then it has been two months and the scandal has taken the form of flooding. The president, however, believes that she has already done her debt.
3856	13	Only if one looks at her statement then will she find that she simply reproduces government positions for "improving the legislation" and "shielding" of the EYP.
3856	15	End: "The case has taken its way before the Authorities and the desire of all of us is to complete and the research to bear fruit as soon as possible." What the government says.
3856	17	New, creepy information has been added since then. The view of "the competent bodies in this case is the House and its Inquiry Committee, as well as the Justice" is lagging behind the reality - and has been violated by the government.
3856	19	The invocation of the "boundaries of the office", according to the "principle of the distinction of powers" to which the head of state resorted, does not apply when it is drawn up with the government in matters of the parties?
3856	21	He does not want to hurt Mitsotakis, but he does not work at all ...
3857	1	Petsas "throws" them to ... Tsipras for the espionage: allowed malicious software to
3857	3	Kyriakos Mitsotakis may have been in the governance of the country for nearly 3.5 years, Nikos Androulakis may have been watched by the EYP without explaining why, the close associate and nephew of Prime Minister Grigoris Dimitriadis may have been dismissed by the story. This may have come to Greece to investigate the scandal and complained that it did not get answers, it may be revelations about the surveillance have taken the form of a snowstorm, but Interior Minister Stelios Petsas insists on the line concentrated in the phrase "Tsipras it's his fault".
3857	5	Specifically, speaking about the espionage scandal on Wednesday morning (16/11) at Mega, the Deputy Minister of the Interior initially said: "First of all, the daily life of the citizen cannot overshadow anything else, because he has serious problems when for example He goes to the pump to put gasoline or diesel or when he goes to the supermarket. So, he cannot overshadow his daily life as much as this. "
3857	7	"Tsipras allowed such software to exist"
3857	9	Regarding the control of the existence or installation of illegal software, Mr Petsas emphasized that "cyber security with a specific coordination committee is also in the pillars of the bill to coordinate the various services involved in it, whether it is the EYP or it is The responsible Ministry of Digital Governance. "
3857	11	Indeed, Mr Petsas then said: "It is important that in the previous context, before the 2019 elections, a few days ago, the then government, Mr Tsipras allowed such software that we today call malicious software without anyone. legal impact. Since 2019, a few days before the election, to date, such monitoring software could be traded. We come and now say that this is illegal. And if it is illegal, the one who possesses it, how can be perceived and then the corresponding sanctions. That is why there is this level of cyber security. "
3857	13	What did he say about removing confidentiality
3857	15	On the removal of privacy for political figures, Mr. Petsas stressed that, "We had had a discussion extensive on the occasion of the scientific confrontation and the positions of Mr. Venizelos or Mr. Gerapetritis, how we can strengthen the need on the one hand The ESP will do its job, but on the other hand, the political staff has some security valves. Such valves were added by the bill under consultation, so that there were various levels before reaching the prosecutor who will allow the permission to remove communications confidentiality. At such a level is the license by the Speaker of the House. "
3857	17	To remove the confidentiality, Mr Petsas said that "it should be documented, such as the suggestion of the EYP and the anti -terrorist and only these two services. Only in this case will the Speaker of the House be able to order to remove confidentiality. Then we will move on to the prosecutor who will finally rule. When we have various public services that do their job, it does not mean that the Prime Minister can be permitted each time because the service is at him or a minister. There is a process within public administration. There will now be a second prosecutor as it once existed and had been abolished by the SYRIZA government. "
3857	19	"When it comes to a person in the House, the Speaker of the House will now be informed, this is provided in the bill. It is a process that is followed in all cases concerning political persons, "the minister added.
3857	21	"As for the political climate, this has to do with many things. We are making institutional initiatives to address where there are issues and one can see shadows or that there are insufficient institutional counterbalances. Now, the three years, from what I realize according to the 4 pillars in the bill tabled yesterday, is something that exists in other countries, so this may have been reigning in the three -year choice. Throughout the 3rd period, Mr. Androulakis has the opportunity to be informed. There should be no need to investigate a case, provided that it is necessary to investigate it by the EYP. There are stages until we get there. In the public consultation that is until November 22 or in Parliament when the legislation comes, if there is a question of 3 years, it will be discussed. But I realize that this option has rectangled because there is a previous one in other European countries, "Mr Petsas said.
3857	23	"When a bill comes into consultation, it comes in to provoke a discussion, to see aspects that may have issues of improvement, and from there, when it comes time to the final submission of the bill, the results of this consultation will be reflected," he added, "he added. .
3858	1	ND: Mr. Polakis shows the real face of SYRIZA
3858	3	"At a time when SYRIZA officially issued a statement condemning the attack on the home of Adonis Georgiades, Mr Tsipras' alter ego, Mr Polakis, was posing an ironic tweet for the attack," a press office said in a statement from the press office. New Democracy.
3858	5	"Will SYRIZA disapprove? Obviously not. After all, it has been proven many times that Mr Polakis is the expression of the party line and shows the real face of SYRIZA, "the ND statement concludes.

386	1	Eye: The fire still burns in the eyes of residents
386	3	By Anastasia Tsivoulis and Nicoletta Moutousi
386	5	Mourning and abandonment weigh the eye, a year after the fire that scattered death and destruction. Words can hardly describe the feelings of relatives, friends, residents of the area found in the memorial that took place yesterday at the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin for their people who were lost in the flames. But the words from the people themselves who managed to come out alive from the nightmare have accurately described what happened on that black day of July 23, 2018. Errors and oligarchs of the state mechanism that had been revealed in a "liberal" on -site research in the region. A few days after the tragedy, and even today, shocking testimonies come to light about what led to the hell of fire, residents, holidaymakers, passing through the area just a few meters from the sea. People who had not been alerted by anyone about the fire that arrived in their yards, people who were trapped in the wrong places with the intervention of the authorities.
386	7	Indicatively, the letter from the residents' Coordinating Committee in Mati Attica to the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis calls for a call for no other valuable time to remedy the problems that still deprive the "oxygen" from the injured area.
386	9	"The affected by the devastating fire of July 23, 2018 in East Attica, a year later, faces serious problems, which is not the time to list. But we would like to disclose you as soon as possible, as we will need your support for personal and the whole government, to overcome obstacles and the rapid restoration of life to a regularity and not to waste any more valuable time. " Characteristically in the appeal of residents to the prime minister.
386	11	Present and absent ...
386	13	The memorial was attended by the Minister of Citizen Protection, Michalis Chrysochoidis, the new Attica Regional Governor, George Patoulis, the mayors of Rafina and Marathon and the Eastern Attica MP of New Democracy Giorgos Vlachos. The Minister of Citizen Protection, Michalis Chrysochoidis, conveyed in his statements the prime minister's involvement in the mourning of relatives and friends of the victims, as well as the government's willingness to support the burns and those affected. "Remembrance day today for a drama whose wounds are open. On behalf of the Prime Minister I convey his involvement in mourning for people who were unjustly lost, to the mourning of the people who lost their own. We are close to looking for care, there are a number of issues that are open, from urban to health issues. For one thing I want to assure you that such a tragedy of untold should not and is not meant to be again, and nowhere. We will work to achieve this, "Mr. Chrysochoid said.
386	15	"We are committed that in cooperation with the government, we will ensure that the affected areas are fully restored and to return to normality in the daily lives of citizens. At the same time, however, our top priority is the best shielding of our Attica by natural disasters, ”said Mr Patoulis.
386	17	The moment was the moment when the priest read the names of the 102 victims of the fire in the bonding after the memorial on the silver coast. The feelings of pain, sadness, and anger from people who are struggling to date were to face their tragic losses of loved ones were pervasive.
386	19	Memory events
386	21	Race, honor and memory took place on Sunday with a starting point and end at the port of Mati.
386	23	Yesterday night with a tribute to Chrysa Spiliotis at the open theater of the escape, in Nea Makri, the memory of the actor and writer who found a tragic death in the July 23 fire was honored.
386	25	Yesterday a memory night dedicated to the victims of the deadly fire of 23rd July in Mati, Neo Voutzas and Rafina, entitled "One Year Later". The event was predicted by Leda Protopsalti, and Chrysoula Diavati, the theater critic, philologist and translator, Kostas Georgousopoulos and the songwriter and resident of the area, Vangelis Germanos. This was followed by the performance of the play "A year later ..." by Konstantinos Rodi and Voula Stambelos, a work -document based on real events and directed by Nanas Nikolaou.
386	27	Today, on the day of the deadly fire, those who wish for it will gather in each affected area and walking the streets of the fire, will end silently at the port of the eye at 8 pm, where a memorial service and the names of the dead will be held.
386	29	No preparation despite the tragedy ...
386	31	Lost European funds, which would help upgrade the firefighting fleet through the Resceu Program, delay in renting the required air means, even in the operation of the European emergency '112' for citizens' warning. This is part of the image left by the previous government in the area of ​​fire protection. Having the 102 dead from the tragedy in the Eye on her back, she did not show the minimum sensitivity to take at least the few measures to avoid respectively.
386	33	A few days before the launch of the firefighting period last May and many months after Eye, the SYRIZA government managed to consult the new Civil Protection Planning bill. However, as all those involved complained, there was no way to apply during the current period, except that its provisions did not bring about a substantial change in the way the units operate. For the rest, as did the then Secretary General of Civil Protection, Yiannis Tafillis, he recognized that the availability of media had the same image as last year.
386	35	Only 4 to 5 Canaders are considered functional, while about 50% of the firefighting fleet vehicles are considered available, with the rest of the damage or in complete disuse. As for staff shortages, these are huge.
386	37	The '112'
386	39	Most striking of all, however, is that the previous government failed to fully operate the extraordinary number "112", which the new Mitsotakis government set the first goal. Already, the Ministry of Digital Reconstruction had contacts with mobile carriers and others will follow. The bet is for the number to work fully by the end of 2019, but an intermediate solution is implemented immediately. In this context, a conventional SMS shipping service is projected to be activated in those mobile phones in areas of interest, and the automatic transmission of messages from television and radio stations is also examined.
3860	1	SYRIZA in Ukraine
3860	3	But why, since Al. Did Tsipras condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine from the first moment, is there so suspicion of SYRIZA's attitude towards Putin? Is it because they did not support the mission of military material to the victims of the war who are fighting for their life, freedom and their homeland? Perhaps why many of his executives have taken a lot of energy to explain the mistakes of the West who, in their analysis, caused Moscow's extreme reaction? The NATO encirclement, the non -inclusion of Russia in European security architecture, the demonstration of fist by the EU. And the US with the manipulation of the countries of the former Soviet Union - the list is long.
3860	5	Certainly the constant set -offs have played a role: Those who bombed Yugoslavia are now shouting for war crimes, Iraq's butchers are shaking their finger, and even Afghanistan remember the Taliban.
3860	7	And of course the proportions mean: on the rails to ban the "swan lake", but a few words about arrests and wood in anti -war demonstrations in Russia. Fair rage for NATO propaganda and tolerance to Russian orchealism. Of great interest in the Golden Dawn country for the Azov Order and the Nazis of Ukraine, although they did not even take 2% in the last elections, a distance from Russian fascism as they are experienced by political opponents, homosexuals, replacement artists, intellectuals, journalists.
3860	9	Then Zelenski does not fill their eye. Where and where the iconic personality of the Western world does Lazopoulos of Ukraine? And why does it call for the immediate involvement of NATO countries with the closure of airspace? Doesn't he care for the third world war? And why doesn't it capitulate as soon as possible? Does the global economy want to be blown up and retreat?
3860	11	And, of course, they don't swallow fake news. These with the bombings of hospitals and the deaths of children are like the Persian Gulf of Kormorano in 1991.
3860	13	The ambiguity is a given, since no controversial commentary, MEP, an executive is condemned.
3860	15	And if Zacharova insulted our country, it is not Albrat, Kontooliza or Powell and Blinken to give it a loud response from the whole political world. Here the Americans suddenly loved Maduro for the oil, did Putin tease them?
3860	17	The ambiguous messages are emitted by SYRIZA executives in their public intervention and, more overtly, their bold supporters on social media. The ambiguity is a given, since no controversial commentary, MEP, an executive is condemned.
3860	19	Are the memories of a past that has never been renounced "normally": Kammenos who was vaccinated in Belgrade with Sputnik-V and posing with a Russian cap was in times of defense-are they forgotten? And he was not the only minister of the Tsipras government who felt awe in the Kremlin - with Prespa spoiled things.
3860	21	An interesting question is whether Alexis Tsipras is annoyed with all this or enjoys them somewhere. If he also considers, like Polakis, that Erdogan puts us the glasses with the witch of neutrality, if he believes in Arvanite's "two imperialisms" and if he does not chew with the heroism of Zelenski of the "murderers" (Karteros). Most likely it will not let us know and that's why it's like we know.
3860	23	* Mrs Angeliki Spanou is a journalist, writer.
3861	1	Theory: Changes in the Pentagon
3861	3	A significant change will be made immediately to the Pentagon and will not go unnoticed. Reportedly, the Director of Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos will be removed, Athan. Valaris, who will move to his political office in Kavala. This is a move imposed from above and as I learn, it did not displease any serious person, or not.
3861	5	Trap to Mitsotakis
3861	7	Experienced executives from Brussels in recent days have said that Dutch MEP Sophie Ind Feld, head of PEGA research in Greece, did something that looks like a trap to Mitsotakis. Specifically, the conclusion she will submit about the spy in our country - in particular detail: it will be her own finding and not the final - will be, as it became known, ready in about three months. In practice, this means, as the experienced executives I told you emphasized, that the issue of surveillance will be revived around March, that is, a breath away from the national elections.
3861	9	Turn
3861	11	As the opposition "raises" the issue of espionage in every way, the first victim of the surveillance that came to light, Nikos Androulakis has lowered the tones. It is noteworthy that at a time when SYRIZA said that the bill on changes to the EYP "legalizes the surveillance", PASOK's president stated (Mega) that the bill is "satisfactory in too many", although he stressed that he disagrees with her. Informing the monitor after a three -year period, saying it must be immediate.
3861	13	Caution
3861	15	Because I was telling you the other day that the issue of the EYP is sensitive and we must not forget that the responsibilities of the service are not those for which it is concerned with timeliness, but mainly national security issues, there should be a calm. And the expiry of the three years for ... information is correct and I explain: An agent in Evros who works in favor of Turkey should be monitored? The answer is obvious and yes. Should he learn the reason for his attendance? The answer is obvious again and it is no. Therefore, calm. In the funnel of the current news, the country's secret services can be dismantled, which I repeat that they have very serious jobs to do and not, of course, to monitor political figures.
3862	1	"Young people do not work, they are staring at mobile": Alekos Syssovitis teaches lazy youth
3862	3	The Greek Celebrit Urge to put the inactive young people on the straight road
3862	5	The footsteps of Kostas Fragolia but with more abusive Zoe/Vassilakis Kaila/Laboratory Background was followed by Alekos Syssovitis. Invited to ERT's "Studio 4" show, the actor gave us a Rant from his hands for young people who are being stuck while they can find work etc etc you know.
3862	7	The noticeable differences with the Rant of Frangolia are that Sysovitis has worked for more than 2 minutes in his life. We did not know it but he himself informed us, as is usually the case in these cases:
3862	9	    "The moment I changed my life is at the age of 13 that my father took me to the building. When you harden and the rest of the kids are out, in cafes and have a carefree life while you have to dig, there you are nourished and even at a minor. The next ones are steps. The building for me was a regime, the whole family was there and we worked. It was so poor in Thessaloniki in the 1980s that you had no choice and you had to be there. My heels were filled. "
3862	11	The other difference is that he did not begin to say about some unknown allowances that are magical to fall from heaven and do not let the world work for the country's prosperity. That's something. On the other hand, it plays such a marketing of the idea that if you want it a lot you will succeed that if you are not a member of creation again you can get anaphylaxis.
3862	13	Here is the controversial point after 17:20. To be prepared for what you will hear, in the interview, even Paulo Coelho is heard:
3862	15	    "I was filled with heels. We're talking about unemployment and I have the "faust" and I'm looking for people to work, I really don't find kids to work. We live in other times. Technology and the internet have changed everything. The world is in autism, sitting on a cellphone, he is embarrassed, he is in a quagmire, in a mud and still does not work, he does not go to work.
3862	17	    They prefer to be 25% unemployed rather than lift the sleeves and work. We know it and at the same time you hear young people say "I don't have a job". Why don't you have a job? Work, go out, look, do and show. I see other young kids who are slaves and that saves them. Einstein used to say that 90% of success is work, not talent. "

3863	1	The flag of the kingdom of Greece gives a well -known democratic newspaper if you are baking to put it on your balcony
3863	3	The necessary accessory for every home that wants to live in sweet post -colonial 50s
3863	5	You may not know what is missing from decorating your home, or better yet, your balcony, but the country's most based conservative newspaper knows it. Where all the other right -wing brochures (the massacre is a special exception) have been sold to the question "how to become the most dummy right -hander without calling you bastards" and chew their words against the impending Sovietization of the country, He brings the flag of our king for a gift.
3863	7	Well you heard, next Sunday, Estonia will have a gift from the Greek flag version worn by the time we still had a crown and palace. So you will be able to put it in your living room or hang it on the balcony so that all passersby will mourn the once King Constantine with you.
3863	9	There is also a video:
3863	11	We told you, now you know what to do.
3864	1	Happy Traveler Mitsotakis chose in Gavdos
3864	3	Who said that climate change has no positive consequences?
3864	5	Our prime minister will go on a hippies paradise on Friday (Friday 6/1). Let's say here that this is the first prime ministerial stroll in Gavdos from the 90s - the last visit had been 26 years before Kostas Simitis. Let's say here that Katerina Sakellaropoulou was remembered last year for the same circumstance.
3864	7	If you are interested in his program, the prime minister will take the military helicopter from Souda at 11am, then present to the show with the Cross and the Sanctification and then inspect the local military outpost. After all these boring, he will set up in his kavatza, put a salvar and start his normal excursion to the island.
3864	9	We had long understood that he is a man with ears open to ideas that question the established perceptions:
3864	11	In any case, we hope that the visit will evolve like this:
387	1	Putin: "Foolish" penalties, they become boomerangs for the West
387	3	He accused the US of considering the rest of the world their "courtyard" and that other states are being treated as "colonies".
387	4	Russian President Vladimir Putin used a harsh language for the Western countries, speaking at the St. Petersburg World Economic Forum.
387	6	With the War in Ukraine having exceeded 110 days, and the US and their allies having imposed a series of sanctions on Moscow, Putin accused the United States of reaching the point of considering themselves as "gods" on planet Earth. , who have no duties except interests. He also argued that the US believes that the rest of the world is their "courtyard" and that other states are being treated as "colonies".
387	8	After declaring the end of the "one of the monopoly era", he said that "nothing would be as it used to be" on the international political scene. He also sent a message to the European Union, saying that "it has completely lost its sovereignty and its elites dance on the basis of someone else's melody, damaging its population. The real interests of Europeans and European businesses are completely ignored and set aside. "
387	10	They have hit their own economies'
387	11	Continuing in the same spirit, he described the sanctions as "reckless" and "irrational" that were intended to "crush" the Russian economy. He argued that Russia has already overcome sanctions, stressing that the gloomy forecasts for his country's economy were not verified.
387	13	On the contrary, he announced that virtually the sanctions have brought the US and Europe to impose them. In particular, he said that European leaders have "hit a serious blow" in their own economies, noting that there is a deterioration of social and economic issues in "Old Epirus". At the same time, in the US there are increases in prices of goods, energy and fuel foods.
387	15	The standard of living of Europeans is falling and their businesses lose their competitiveness, the Russian president also stressed, arguing that this will have long -term consequences throughout Europe. He even warned that the systematic economic decline in the European economy would exacerbate the major problems in Western societies.
387	17	Partnerships with other countries
387	18	He also claimed that Russia was "forced" to move on to a "special business" in Ukraine, referring to a difficult but necessary decision. He argued that the Russian forces were defending the country's rights for security and that the military operation aims to defend the people of Donbas.
387	20	He sent a message with the West that Moscow would "expand" its cooperation with other countries ("with all who are interested," he said characteristically), noting that there are so many states who want to work with Russia corresponding to a "" overwhelming number of people on the planet. " However, he avoided naming these states.
388	1	Cinema and NATO realism
388	3	As an artistic stream, socialist realism is obsolete. But in the strange neo-Cold War era when we live another realism, it promotes the international horizon: NATO realism that manifests not only at the political, military level but also on the ideological and artistic. At least this impression is given by the Lavian Greeting Message by Zelenski to the opening ceremony of this year's Cannes Festival. We need films like Charlie Chaplin's "dictator", the Ukrainian president said - and who can have objections? (I wish you were films and like the "modern times" that will talk about the unmistakable work war of our time.)
388	5	For the first time in recent history, representatives of the hard -core military establishment are open to Ukraine in Eurovision, as the NATO Deputy Secretary General did. Where we were talking about the military/industrial complex now we see the military/artistic complex emerging. Politics has always used art, but it has never been the conjunction of power and spectacle.
388	7	Half a century ago, the tone at the Cannes Festival (canceled) was given by the naughty children of French May and Godar. This year the tone is given by the khaki Milter shirt of Zelenski and his "glory in Ukraine".
