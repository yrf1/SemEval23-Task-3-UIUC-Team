391	1	Arno Khidirbegishvili: The fate of the "Islamic State" of "Kiev State"
391	3	The purpose of propaganda is to create public opinion. The Ministry of Goebbels introduced the Germans to the Germans that the Aryans were the highest race, and all the rest of the sub -codes, whose purpose is slave labor. The powerful propaganda machine of the West, through local TV companies and NGOs, inspires Georgians that two dozen European states and US civilizations, while Russia and the rest of the world, including Georgians themselves, should force "democracy". In the vanguard of Western propaganda are their ambassadors, who have long terminated diplomacy and turned into agitators.
391	5	After the collapse of the USSR and to this day, due to the indifference of Georgian and Russian political, diplomatic and public elites, unprofessionalism and/or selling, Western propaganda in Georgia does not resist (except for several media, which has modest opportunities for the lack of government support). As a result, there was a public opinion in Georgia that wild Slavs who walk with ears and drink vodka directly from the bottle (Cold War propagandist stamp) do nothing but occupation of foreign lands.
391	7	What is a deliberately created public opinion? It is a furious crowd that stones at anyone who points to - most often idealists and tellers of truth. These are collective letters, demanding the shooting of the enemies of the people and their children to be cut off from society. These are the Nazi gatherings on the Central Avenue of the Georgian Capital, which are ready to be in the middle of anyone who speaks about friendship with Russia!
391	9	But despite the unlimited financial capabilities of pro -Western propaganda media and the open support of Western embassies, despite the older generation that remembers the friendship of peoples in the Soviet Union, and only a few dozen of the Great Patriotic War veterans have been crushing in Georgia. Apart from those who are propagating this and some of the radical opposition to the US Embassy, ​​the Georgian people did not recognize the Russians as occupants, hospitamately meet Russian tourists and dream of restoring former friendship with Russia. A simple Georgian does not need political science to calculate: “NATO did not protect us in 2008, just as it now does not protect Ukraine, who has only been given a gun to kill as many Russians as possible! NATO, the US and the EU have not declared any sanctions for Russia and Tskhinvali, as they have declared because of Crimea and Donbas! NATO did not accept us and not even MAP gave us, and the European Commission rejected the status of EU candidate, which was given to Ukraine and Moldova. And, despite this perennial lie, today the West had a brazenness to hit the Russians in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali and open the "Second Georgian Front" to help Ukraine!
391	11	Yes, the Georgian authorities and the ruling party continue to adhere to the "Euro -Atlantic Course", at the same time, without criticism, leaving no statement by Washington and Brussels, which goes beyond international law and diplomatic etiquette. The US and Europe measured everyone with their measurement, so they could not even imagine that the Georgian people, Prime Minister Gharibashvili and the ruler of the Georgian Dream Kobakhidze would refuse to go to the "icons on the Metekhi Bridge", that is, to the memory of Orthodox faiths, ancestors, and national interests! The sense of moderation clearly betrayed the Western collective of "Friends of Georgia" and they went farther, abused the Georgians' self -esteem, which is important on bread! Saakashvili's once-headed "Nazi movement" and his satellites are on the verge of extinction, and as soon as the grants are cut off, the "civil sector", which is mainly staffed by LGBT, will disappear from television screens.
391	13	“History is repeated! - Sakinform's Permanent Reader Maya Gabrichidze in Facebook's comment, - Even during World War II, all of Europe was in favor of Hitler and tried to get rid of Russia and remove it! Genius Stalin defeated fascism and Nazism then and saved mankind! Georgians and Rustavi Khrushchev gave the Crimean land of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers, strengthening Bandera's supporters! Today Russia is fighting against Nazism and fascism!.
391	15	I will specify the words of readers: When all of Europe was on Hitler's side during World War II (and delaying the opening of the "second front" until the glorious victory became inevitable!), "It was" all of Europe, Georgians, Georgians and the USSR. Against. The whole of Europe supplied Hitler with a weapon and a man -made fight against the Red Army, including 700,000 fighters from Georgia. And today Europe is against the Russians and also against the Georgians, who have refused to fight the Russians, which they want to punish the government through a coup and return Saakashvili to power!
391	17	The history of the "Islamic State", which was created by the United States, was repeated with weapons and money until it threatened Americans. The same will happen to the "Kiev State" - the strangers of the Botas and T -shirts who are demanding a new army party have already been blackmailed and the benefits are much less than harm. They will not kill so many Russians to make the European economy worth global problems! And when the West leaves Ukrainian terrorists, as abandoned by ISIS, counting on hours will start ... The Kiev regime will never become a state, just as ISIS has become a state, because the state cannot just massacre, and the terrorists know nothing else.

3911	3	Georgia, September 7, Sakinform. The so -called When the anti -Russian authorities ruled the country 20 percent surrendered to the Russian Federation, Irakli Kobakhidze, Chairman of the Georgian Dream, said.
3911	5	He said that during the Georgian Dream government the country did not lose its territory.
3911	7	“We have been in power for ten years and we are the first government under which there was no war and Russia did not have territorial progress. During the United National Movement, 20 percent surrendered to the Russian Federation, the so -called. When the anti -Russian authorities ruled the country, then 20 percent of Russia were transferred to Russia. During our government we know everything carefully, observe and respond properly, ”Kobakhidze said.
3912	1	Archil Talakvadze: If we had a visa -free regime with Europe under the rule of the National Movement, believe me, there would be no light in the light
3912	3	Georgia, September 7, Sakinform. Most people left Georgia during the rule of the United National Movement and Georgia had a visa -free regime at Georgia, believe me, the light would not be left in the country, - Vice -Speaker of Parliament Archil Talakvadze said at the fall session.
3912	5	According to him, the statistics of migration under the rule of the Georgian Dream are positive.
3912	7	“The really agreed and orchestrated campaign is already going on to convince the public as if the whole of Georgia is leaving the country. Anyone who made statements about this would like to ask you whether you know the statistics of migration, did you know that the only positive difference in migration statistics is the last 15-20 years of the Georgian Dream government. Did you know that during the rule of the United National Movement it was the highest rate of migration? Most of the people left Georgia during your rule and with Georgia's Europe, then, believe me, the light would not be left in this country. Today, you have brazenness and blame that the government is doing the job, leaving citizens from this country. Look at the statistics, ”Talakvadze said.
3912	9	At this seat, he appealed to opposition lawmaker Beka Liluashvili to verify the migration statistics at the next session and then make statements.
3913	1	Recep Tayyip Erdogan - European countries are sowing - European attitude towards Mr. Putin, his sanctions led Putin to say, "If you do it, I will do that"
3913	3	Georgia, September 7, Sakinform. European attitudes towards Vladimir Putin led Putin to say, "If you do it, I will do it," the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said, who cited the sanctions against Russia.
3913	5	According to him, European countries "do what they sowed."
3913	7	“They are sown what they sow. Europe's attitude towards Mr. Putin has led Putin to say, "If you do it, I'll do it." It uses all means and weapons. Natural gas, unfortunately, is one of them, ”Erdogan said.
3914	1	Giga Bokeria: We have an anti -Georgian government, it is impossible to work with the Dream
3914	3	“Our share of responsibility, I mean the whole community, but the political parties first and foremost, I can talk about myself and my team, it is a situation where it is possible to sit and work with different political forces, even though they do not like each other.
3914	5	However, today we have a government that considers the authors of such messages as an enemy of the EU and the US. It is campaigning that they were trying to engage in war, so it is a different context. "
3914	7	According to him, until this context changes until we have a pro -European, pro -Western government that does not interfere with the enemy and the lover, it simply cannot be done or just cheating on our partners.
3914	9	“From the civilized world to the expectation of what is in these messages, it is natural. There is another story that the situation in Georgia has disappeared. All this is possible if the government and the opposition have the same vision on some strategic issues and we, with European Georgia Ivanishvili and his team, which seriously spreads the pest propaganda that Europe and America forced us to engage in war and set blood puddles in Georgia, and they were heroic. We will never agree with that.
3914	11	We have no common strategic task if we have a common strategic task with someone who is, of course, should work with him. Anyone who disagrees and needs a discussion is needed with them who agree with everything in your team, but there are no limits of agreeing.
3914	13	If anyone wants to draw parallels, our Western partners were mistaken in their time with Putin, they had to call on both sides to call for restraint - Georgia and Russia, as if we were going to conquer the North Caucasus, I was not identical.
3914	15	This should be perceived as the articulation of expectations from our partners as the situation in Georgia, but in order for that situation to come, it is our responsibility to change it all, that is, to have a pro -Western, pro -Georgian government. This is very important, pro -Western, pro -European, pro -American and pro -Georgian. ”There are synonyms, and anti -Western and anti -American are synonymous with anti -Georgian. Today we have anti -Western, anti -European, or anti -Georgian authorities, and it will not be possible with it, ”Giga Bokeria said.
3914	17	“We have an anti -Western or anti -Georgian government with which we have no common strategic task, it is impossible to work with the Dream.
3915	1	Irakli Kobakhidze: In the radical opposition, they are the people who are immense people, they are hostile to their own country and the people
3915	3	These are the people who are not worried about the state, on the contrary, the state, their own country, and the people. Therefore, they are directly interested in the fact that neither European integration nor the country - Georgian Dream Chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said to the journalist's question - how correct the opposition is directly to say that nothing is done when the process has begun, the state issue is on the ground And discrediting this process by any party will eventually reflect the future of the state.
3915	5	According to him, what is behind it, the public can even discuss it. The fact is that they do not serve their country, and on the contrary, they are in the service that contradicts the interests of the state.
3915	7	“These are the people who are not worried about the state, and on the contrary, the state, their own country and the people are hostile. Therefore, they are directly interested in the fact that neither European integration nor the country go ahead. What is behind this, the public can also discuss it, and we may even talk about it more broadly, but the fact is that they do not serve their own country and, on the contrary, stand in the service that contradicts the interests of the state and our national interests. The main evaluator is the Georgian society, the society sees it, it evaluates it, and the result is that in all the elections we have 48 times 47%of the population, ”Irakli Kobakhidze said.
3916	1	Irakli Kobakhidze on Opposition: "Reading the Gospel of the Wolf" is like to go out and ask for something that stirring up polarization
3916	3	People are told the first point that the main task should be depolarization and is like "reading the Gospel on top of the wolf", they come out and directly ask for something that is stirring up polarization - early elections, promotions, etc. - Chairman of the Georgian Dream, Irakli Kobakhidze said that he responded to the statement of Nika Melia, the chairman of the United National Movement, which was referring to the appointment of extraordinary elections.
3916	5	According to him, Nika Melia tried to strengthen her positions inside the party with radical messages, but she does not believe in her own demand.
3916	7	“We act with our responsibility. We created working groups and called everyone to get involved. If they do not do what we do, they will not be able to unilaterally, we will not force anyone to get involved. It is democracy. Someone does not need European integration. The "National Movement", as Vashadze does not clearly do 12 paragraphs, is democracy and can have their own foreign policy, but our desire is European integration, candidate status and they are afraid that we will score the status of a candidate, etc. Fear, they have their own choice, they are part of democracy.
3916	9	As for early elections - people are told the first point that the main task should be to depolarize and read the gospel on top of the wolf, they come out and directly ask for something that is stirring up polarization - early elections, promotions, etc. This is their choice, they do not want to depolarize, nor execute 12 paragraphs, as they are afraid of execution of 12 paragraphs. They think that if they give us the status of a candidate in this case we will write points and therefore they will lose. Staying in this fear and being in place, it is democracy and their choice.
3916	11	The elections will be in 2024. They do not believe in their own demand. Nika Melia has released, they have internal problems that seem to be very clear in Facebook and have tried some radical messages to strengthen their positions within the party, but her own demand that she did not believe it seemed clear. The main problem is what is theirs? This is a lack of community support, that is, people do not support them, and under such conditions, there will certainly be successful requirements that they will set up for extraordinary elections, and the actions will not be successful. In the last election we have taken 47%, which is a miracle in democracy when the ruling party takes 47%of the age of 8 years. It is indeed a result that shows many things, including how negative is the majority of society in the political force To what is called the National Movement, which brought the country to the loss, torture and a thousand trouble, ”Irakli Kobakhidze said.
3917	1	"Nothing will lose us, we will not lose, but the main purchase is to strengthen our sovereignty," Putin on the Ukrainian war
3917	3	Russian President Vladimir Putin called the invasion of Ukraine "a mirrored response to enemy actions." He said this in a plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum.
3917	5	According to Putin, Russia has lost nothing as a result of the Ukrainian war and world polarization has only benefited.
3917	7	"I think nothing will be lost or lost, in terms of purchase, I can say that the main purchase is to strengthen our sovereignty and this is an inevitable result of what is happening now," Putin said.
3917	9	As the Russian president noted, in terms of military operations, the Russian Federation has nothing to do with it, trying only to end.
3918	1	Giga Bokeria: Early elections are no initiative of Melia, this is another air release
3918	3	“I find it comical to baptize Nika Melia as an initiative. If I start talking about early elections again, will this be my initiative?! "It would be good to have early elections" - you will now come and ask Melia Bokeria's initiative?! "No, yeah, and I would also like to say exactly, this is not Melia's initiative, this is another air release."
3918	5	“This position has been in existence for a long time and we have this position of European Georgia from the outset when there was a stupid talk that they could agree on 12 points and the end of the year was announced by Melia until the end of the year remembered last year? We then said that the task could be early elections, but you could not have any expectations, to set some limit, because until there is a public peaceful protest to the degree that you have to make it a regime, you will not achieve it.
3918	7	So we have the task of being mobilized by the public that it should not be held in the elections, or in the term of 2024 or early, which is very desirable, such as Ivanishvili's illegal actions, of course, agree with Melia.
3918	9	This is achievable and requires many more citizens involved in this process, and for early elections, these citizens have been ready for long -term, patience protests next year, and it needs to be restored to the political process, and that confidence needs to be returned from those players. From the biggest player from the United National Movement, demonstrating how bad they did when they cheated on voters many times unlike us.
3919	1	“This is our duty and we will perform. In the end, this will lead to strengthening our country. ”
3919	3	According to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, Russia has nothing to do with the "special military operation" in Ukraine and is only trying to complete it. Putin stated about this in a speech at the Economic Forum.
3919	5	“We have nothing to do with military operations, we are just trying to complete. The hostilities began in 2014 after the "state coup" in Ukraine. The "military operation" aims to release people who have been under pressure in Donbas for eight years, "Putin said.
3919	7	According to him, Russia made the decision after the issue was not resolved peacefully.
3919	9	“All our actions are aimed at helping people living in Donbas. This is our duty and we will perform. In the end, it will lead to strengthening our country, ”Putin added.
392	1	Arno Khidirbegishvili: Russians are fighting Nazism, not Ukrainians!
392	3	“Mr. Arno, how do you explain the great damage that the cities already taken by the Russian army are experiencing as a result of rocket attacks from the Ukrainian Armed Forces? Where does Kiev have such forces for a half -year war for counterattacks? Why is the Russian army still fighting in Donbas if it is so strong, and does not go to Kiev? Is it impossible to expel Ukrainians from Zaporozhie's atomic power plant so that their missiles do not achieve their goal? - Tbilisi residents are asked and I cannot answer unequivocally, as the incident has both objective and subjective reasons.
392	5	I will start with the easiest and simple Georgians to understand the technical issues. The strength of the Ukrainian armed forces is not in the Wai-Beauviks, but in foreign forms of Georgian Legion and Azov, but in the staff, who received military academic education in the Soviet army and schools. And what was the priority in the Soviet Army as far as the Great Patriotic War? Correct, artillery! Therefore, experienced artillerymen, who have a huge number of missiles and shells from the USSR-DSP time, and twice as modern West, can truly harm cities and objects. In general, every day of the war assures us that Ukraine has been seriously preparing for war with Russia in recent years, as the Ukrainian armed forces continue to fight despite the huge losses of equipment and armament.
392	7	However, as for land operations, aviation, armor and other armed forces, the tactics of their actions that have undergone cardinal changes after the Soviet period, the Ukrainian army has not been properly trained and no groups of instructors and employees, especially in a short period of time The situation cannot change. Therefore, for example, the attack in Kharkov's direction was hidden after a deafening artillery preparation and no longer continued. But Western Ukraine gives the armed forces money and supplies weapons not for defense and retreat, but for attacks and breakthroughs, and for Ukrainian human losses are not taken into account - for the Westers it is the cheapest anti -Russian mass in the world in which Russia should be torn down to the world so that the US is more free (One -polar) act, in particular against China.
392	9	Now - for subjective reasons. The point is that the Russians have not yet been angry. It is difficult for Russia to understand that the closest nation, which did not distinguish himself, is the number one enemy for him today. It is difficult to get used to the idea that Ukraine and Ukrainians, who were referred to in the USSR for 70 years after the Russian Federation and Russians, whose flag and coat of arms were the first in all the flags of the Soviet Union and the Coat of Arms in all posters, pictures and textbooks. Ukrainians, with whom they fought in the Great Patriotic War! Do you remember Dugin's words at his daughter's funeral that he has no thirst for revenge and only wants to win? This is the essence of the real Russian, which in Ukraine, and not fighting Ukrainians, relieves oppressed by Banderel's policies, sadist butchers who have offended our parents' memory! Anyone who shook the Liberators' monuments, even though this monument was also monuments of Ukrainian heroes. Hero cities of Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol - this is our common history, still find the remains of Georgians killed in the Kerch Peninsula ... while Ukrainian neo -Nazis are fighting the Russians, destroying the Russians and thus different from the Russian soldier. Along with the Russians, their enemy is everyone who fights on the side of the Russian army - Chechens, Armenians, Belarus, and many more, or almost all nations of the former USSR. That is why they want to make a Zaporozhi nuclear power plant and kill many innocent people with radio!
392	11	And when the Russians really get angry when they realize that the unconscious are not falling down from the German fascists, they will be angry to destroy them, and woe to those who then go on the road to a Russian soldier, whether Ukrainian, American or European! The enemies are destroyed, not allowed to sell millions of tons of grains, so that enemies of Ukrainian descent buy weapons and kill the Russians, kill children and girls as Daria; Whereas other enemies in the West do not die of hunger and make a deadly weapon to send Ukrainian weapons after the Ukrainian bread!

3926	1	China has approved the world's first nose -to -ceiling vaccine
3926	3	Just one inhalation of the new vaccine aerosol is a strong defense against Covid-19. Chinese manufacturer of vaccines Cansino reports about it.
3926	5	The Chinese regulator has approved the Covid-19 vaccine as a Busterdose. As a result, this is the first alternative to the injection vaccine after the start of the pandemic.
3926	7	The inhalation vaccine contains the same ingredients as other Chinese vaccines, but the flight device transforms it from a liquid form to aerosol.
3926	9	Like the American vaccines of Covid-19, the Cansino formula contains parts of genetic material so that the body can detect the virus.
3926	11	Vaccines to Moderna and PFIZER are directly introduced, and the Cansino vaccine uses a safe version of the usual cold virus to transfer coronavirus information.
3926	13	According to the World Health Organization, Cansino's single-dose vaccine is 92 percent effective against the acute form of Covid-19, with a 58-percent efficiency in terms of protection against the disease.
3926	15	Its clinical attempts as a Buster (after one dose of injection vaccine) showed that it was as effective as two doses of Sinovac vaccine.
3926	17	The vaccine enhances the protection of the nose and the upper respiratory tract, where the virus enters the body.
3926	19	Other vaccines have been transformed into a vaccine in the past, such as Flumist, which is used in pediatric departments every season of the flu.
3926	21	Vaccines for children and many adults are unnecessary alternatives, but as evidence indicates influenza last seasons, aerosol vaccines do not always reach the same level of effectiveness as the vaccines for injection.
