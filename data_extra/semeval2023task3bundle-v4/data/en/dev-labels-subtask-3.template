813452859	1	EU Profits From Trading With UK While London Loses Money – Political Campaigner
813452859	3	With the Parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan set to be held next month; President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has criticised the UK’s preparations for their departure from the EU.
813452859	4	But is there any chance that May's deal will make it through parliament and if it fails, how could this ongoing political deadlock finally come to an end?
813452859	5	Sputnik spoke with political campaigner Michael Swadling for more…
813452859	6	Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of getting her deal through Parliament on the 14th January?
813452859	7	Michael Swadling: I guess her only chance is if Labour decides that they want to dishonour democracy and effectively keep us in the EU.

813452859	9	There is a chance; as unfortunately there are many MPs who don't respect the vote and may just turn on it, but short of that I don't see any way the Conservatives would vote for it, and the majority is slender as it is, as the DUP is bitterly against it, and I can't see the Lib Dems voting for it, so it will only be if there are enough, what I can describe as remoaner MPs, that the deal won't be dead in the water.
813452859	10	Sputnik: What could be a solution to the political chaos if the Prime Minister's deal is not approved?
813452859	11	Michael Swadling: The EU withdrawal act is in place; we'll leave and revert to WTO terms and that works, that's fine.
813452859	12	I often use the example of an iPhone to people; that's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China, uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms, this isn't a fantasy, stuck in a port somewhere, there isn't a massive tariff, this is the world that really exists today.
813452859	13	When we exit the EU on WTO terms; that will be fine for whatever trading we do with the EU, just as well as it does for our trade in China.READ MORE: UK Finance Chief Bashed for Failing to Unlock Money for No-Deal Brexit — Reports
813452859	14	Sputnik: Do you think that the EU needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU?
813452859	15	Michael Swadling: The EU makes a profit on its trade with the UK; the UK makes a loss on its trade with the EU.
813452859	16	They have a financial incentive to ensure that good trading relations continue far more than we do.

813494037	3	The spectacular fireworks that lit up the London sky on Monday night caused a stir on social media over the display's pro-EU message, at a time when the nation is divided over its looming withdrawal from the bloc.
813494037	4	London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced mounting criticism after the capital's New Year's Eve fireworks display, which celebrated ties with the European Union, left a bad taste in the mouths of some Brits.
813494037	5	The 135-metre-high London Eye was lit up in blue while its tubs turned yellow, with the giant Ferris wheel resembling the star-studded flag of the European Union.Sadiq Khan called his fireworks display a "message of support" to EU citizens living in London.
813494037	6	"Our one million EU citizens are Londoners, they make a huge contribution, and no matter the outcome of Brexit — they will always be welcome", he said.
813494037	7	To the one million EU citizens who have made our city your home: you are Londoners, you make a huge contribution and you are welcome here.
813494037	8	I'm proud that tonight we will welcome in the new year with a message of support to you.

813494037	10	However, a host of Londoners rushed to Twitter to accuse their mayor of "politicising" the celebrations — with some are even calling for his resignation.
813494037	11	I cannot believe this event has been politicised.
813494037	12	This man has no shame.
813494037	13	Just resign.

813494037	15	Thanks a lot Sadiq Khan you ruined the fireworks display by talking about Europe, need I remind you about Brexit.
813494037	16	You have started of the new year by talking about relationships with the European Union.

813494037	29	The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 via a nationwide referendum, with 51.9 per cent voting in favour of pulling out of the bloc, while 48.1 per cent wanted to remain.
813494037	30	The withdrawal is scheduled for the end of March; the Article 50 deadline.
813494037	31	The Remain sentiment dominated London, with nearly 60 percent of voters wanting Britain to stay in the European Union.
813494037	32	Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Remainer himself, earlier called for a second referendum on Brexit.
813494037	33	"The government's abject failure — and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a 'no deal' Brexit — means that giving people a fresh say is now the right — and only — approach left for our country," he said in September.
813547724	1	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the UK should not 'underestimate its strength' after Brexit
813547724	3	Post-Brexit Britain should use its power to defend democracy around the world, Jeremy Hunt will say today.
813547724	4	The Foreign Secretary will insist the UK should not 'underestimate' its strength.
813547724	5	'We are not a superpower and we do not have an empire,' he will say in a speech in Singapore.
813547724	6	'But we do have the fifth-biggest economy in the world, the third-biggest overseas aid budget, the second-biggest military budget in Nato, one of the two biggest financial centres, the world's language, highly effective intelligence services and a world-class diplomatic network.
813547724	7	'We also have immense reserves of soft power, with three of the world's top ten universities, 450,000 international students, 39million visits by tourists in 2017, and a global audience for our media, especially the BBC, measured in the hundreds of millions.'
813547724	8	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit.
813547724	9	He is pictured in Myanmar before Christmas
813547724	10	Mr Hunt will point to Britain's links with the Commonwealth, the United States and Europe, saying: 'Those connections are why Britain's post-Brexit role should be to act as an invisible chain linking together the democracies of the world ... who share our values and support our belief in free trade, the rule of law and open societies.
813547724	11	'We should begin by being realistic about our global position.
813547724	12	That means not overestimating our strength but not underestimating it either.'
813547724	13	Mr Hunt will highlight worrying figures showing that 71 countries saw reversals of political and civil liberties in 2017.
813547724	14	He will sign a 'strategic partnership' with Singapore covering areas including defence and education.
813552066	1	You insult us, ambassador: Woody Johnson flagrantly abused special relationship, says PETER OBORNE
813552066	3	With three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through Parliament.
813552066	4	Next week, MPs will reassemble at Westminster — and the following week, they will vote on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.
813552066	5	If they vote it down, Britain will be plunged into the greatest constitutional crisis in more than 100 years.
813552066	6	Mrs May might even resign and a new prime minister take over.
813552066	7	The stakes could not be higher.
813552066	8	U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit
813552066	9	Into this national crisis of epic proportions has just waded the clodhopping U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson.
813552066	10	On Monday, Mr Johnson foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May’s premiership.
813552066	11	He informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit.
813552066	12	Lethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain’s closest ally and strategic partner — with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II.
813552066	13	This brutal attack by Donald Trump’s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her — and Britain’s — future.
813552066	14	All the more so since he held out the carrot of a ‘quick, very massive bilateral trade deal’ .

813552066	19	Ambassador to U.K. Woody Johnson as he leaves the latter's residence in London
813552066	20	Notorious
813552066	21	Furthermore, Mr Johnson’s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James’s.
813552066	22	The first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics.
813552066	23	Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest.
813552066	24	By implication, Mr Johnson has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘losers’ whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account.
813552066	25	There is no defence of Mr Johnson’s conduct.
813552066	26	And no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement.
813552066	27	Mr Johnson, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy.
813552066	28	This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party.
813552066	29	Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush’s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run.
813552066	30	The switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism.
813552066	31	But then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as Johnson to important ambassadorial jobs.
813552066	32	Take Lana Marks, the President’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
813552066	33	She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities.
813552066	34	In common with an embarrassing number of Trump’s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump’s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members’ resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website.
813552066	35	Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump’s presidential campaign.
813552066	36	Everything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump.
813552066	37	And, in December, Trump’s administration put forward as America’s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy.
813552066	38	Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals
813552066	39	Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers.
813552066	40	In truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions.
813552066	41	Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. ambassador to London.
813552066	42	Woody Johnson cannot be classed in their company.
813552066	43	This scion of the industrial company Johnson & Johnson — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division.
813552066	44	Outcry
813552066	45	Twelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm’s involvement in tax avoidance schemes.
813552066	46	Johnson said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful.
813552066	47	However, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest.
813552066	48	In Britain, such a record could have debarred Johnson from further involvement in public life.
813552066	49	And the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry.
813552066	50	But then, it’s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody Johnson did with Mrs May on New Year’s Eve.
813552066	51	Of course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House.
813552066	52	Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President
813552066	53	He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump’s America.
813552066	54	Or on the progress of Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President.
813552066	55	Squirming
813552066	56	He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President.
813552066	57	Above all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
813552066	58	I should point out that Mr Johnson did say that Britain’s future was ‘extremely positive, extremely bright’.
813552066	59	But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister.
813552066	60	Professional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP.
813552066	61	I can’t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody Johnson.
813552066	62	So when Trump’s crony Johnson turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage.
813552066	63	The fact is that Johnson is out of his depth.
813552066	64	Like his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S.
813552066	65	If the President won’t rein him in — and I’m not holding my breath — Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act.
813552066	66	And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.

813602345	1	New year ushered in with fireworks and European solidarity
813602345	3	The words “London is open” rang in the new year as the capital welcomed 2019 with a dazzling riverside fireworks display.
813602345	4	The phrase was spoken in seven languages around two minutes past midnight as the city skyline filled with lights in the largest annual display in Europe.

813602345	12	The display lit up London (Yui Mok/PA)
813602345	13	“I think the Government’s made a mess of negotiations with the European Union,” Mr Khan continued.
813602345	14	“Bearing in mind Parliament can’t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government,” he said.
813602345	15	He vowed that London would remain the same after March 29 2019, and said the fireworks display was about “showing the world, while they’re watching us, that we’re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic”.
813602345	16	Some 100,000 ticket-holders lined the banks of the Thames to watch 70,000 projectiles made up of eight tonnes of fireworks fire into the sky from three barges and the London Eye.

813602345	18	Mr Khan continued: “We, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world, one of the reason we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans.”
813602345	19	“I think diversity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that diversity.
813602345	20	“I hope that members of Parliament, members of the Government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March.”
813603860	1	Labour activists 'could QUIT the party over Corbyn's Brexit referendum stance'
813603860	3	Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
813603860	4	The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
813603860	5	Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
813603860	6	But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
813603860	7	There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
813603860	8	The research underlined the scale of the challenge Jeremy Corbyn faces from Labour members, with thousands considering quitting, nearly a quarter believing he is a Brexiteer, and nearly three quarters wanting a new referendum
813603860	9	Attending a rail fare protest in central London today, Mr Corbyn again dodged as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists on Brexit
813603860	10	The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
813603860	11	Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
813603860	12	Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said:'Our survey of Labour's grassroots clearly shows that Corbyn's apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labour's members want, and it doesn't reflect the views of most Labour voters either.''
813603860	13	Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, Mr Corbyn said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
813603860	14	'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
813603860	15	'This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.
813603860	16	It's finally going to take place the second week of January.
813603860	17	That is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago.
813603860	18	This Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May's deal.
813603860	19	'Well both of those options are completely unacceptable.'
813603860	20	The work was carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project.
813603860	21	Some 29 per cent of Labour's rank-and-file members said they oppose the stance that the party has taken on Brexit - and 56 per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting.
813603860	22	That proportion would be equivalent to around 88,000 members, according to the project's analysis.
813603860	23	If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some 88 per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, 3 per cent said they would leave with Theresa May's deal and 5 per cent would support leaving with no deal.
813603860	24	If the choice was between the Prime Minister's deal and leaving the EU without an agreement, some 27 per cent of Labour members said they would boycott the vote altogether, although 46 per cent said they would take Mrs May's deal.
813603860	25	Some 89 per cent of Labour members - compared with 65 per cent of current Labour voters and only 45 per cent of all voters - are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.
813603860	26	While just 35 per cent of the electorate as a whole believe that warnings of short-term disruption with potential problems for food and medicine supplies in a no-deal Brexit are realistic, that figure rises to 82 per cent of Labour members and 58 per cent of Labour voters.
813603860	27	Prof Bale said: 'Our survey suggests Labour's membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end.
813603860	28	Theresa May (pictured delivering her New Year message) has been battling to get her Brexit deal through Parliament
813603860	29	'It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party's members on either count, are in the same camp.
813603860	30	'Labour's grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.
813603860	31	'As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour's leader to get off the fence.'
813603860	32	Labour MP Phil Wilson said: 'An overwhelming majority of Labour's voters, as well as its members, want the public to have the final say on Brexit and to stay in the European Union.
813603860	33	'But the leadership has too often hidden behind myths that Labour is almost evenly divided on this issue when the clear evidence from this and other polls shows that it is the leadership which is increasingly out of step with its supporters.'
813603860	34	The Sedgefield MP added: 'Labour's leadership now has a huge opportunity to be at the front of a popular campaign against the Government's Brexit deal and make sure the public are given the right to have the final say in the form of a People's Vote.
813603860	35	'I urge Jeremy to seize this chance to change the course of history, before it's too late.'
813603860	36	YouGov surveyed 1,034 Labour Party members between December 17 and 21 2018.
813603860	37	The pollster also surveyed a representative sample of 1,675 British adults on December 18-19.
813623212	1	'Wishful thinking': Tory MPs dismiss May's hopes for change of heart on Brexit deal
813623212	3	Jeremy Hunt insisted Theresa May can still salvage her Brexit deal today - despite Tory MPs branding her hopes of getting it through Parliament 'wishful thinking'.
813623212	4	The Foreign Secretary said he believed the PM will 'find a way' to win the looming Commons vote by getting assurances with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop is only temporary.
813623212	5	But senior Conservatives said they were detecting no sign of a shift in opinion over the Christmas break, warning that 'nothing has changed'.
813623212	6	Brexit hostilities have been resumed with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.
813623212	7	The moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.
813623212	8	The premier used her New Year message to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'.
813623212	9	She said passing the deal would mean the UK can thrive and 'start a new chapter with optimism and hope'.
813623212	10	Mr Hunt added his voice to the pleas today, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'.
813623212	11	On a trip to Singarpore today, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added his voice to the pleas to Tory MPs, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'

813623212	13	Senior Tories Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood are among those who have renewed their vow to oppose the Brexit deal
813623212	14	Speaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.
813623212	15	'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.
813623212	16	'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.
813623212	17	'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.
813623212	18	'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'
813623212	19	Mr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.
813623212	20	'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.
813623212	21	'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.
813623212	22	'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'
813623212	23	He also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.
813623212	24	Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.
813623212	25	Mrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.
813623212	26	But the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.
813623212	27	The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.
813623212	28	However, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.
813623212	29	Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.
813623212	30	Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.
813623212	31	And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.

813623212	41	Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.
813623212	42	'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.
813623212	43	'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'
813623212	44	Sir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.
813623212	45	'Parliament exists to make our laws.
813623212	46	This Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'
813623212	47	Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.
813623212	48	'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.
813623212	49	'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.
813623212	50	They would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'
813623212	51	Another senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'
813623212	52	They added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...
813623212	53	'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'
813623212	54	Mr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.
813623212	55	He said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.
813623212	56	'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.
813623212	57	'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'
813623212	58	Mr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.

813714967	3	This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com
813714967	4	Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff
813714967	5	Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
813714967	6	Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff
813714967	8	Migrants from France arriving in Dover, England, this week (SPLASH)
813714967	9	It is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.
813714967	10	Britain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.
813714967	11	Now the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.
813714967	12	The problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).
813714967	13	Ireland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as “The Troubles,” which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.
813714967	14	It has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the “Brexiteers” (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier-free border.
813714967	15	So that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.
813714967	16	So there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:
813714967	17	“Crashing out of the EU” – a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	18	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan.
813714967	19	Killing the whole Brexit thing.
813714967	20	Kicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.
813714967	21	There is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no-deal Brexit.
813714967	22	In my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.
813714967	23	I had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two-year notice on March 29, 2017.
813714967	24	However, in the last few months, an E.U.
813714967	25	court has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two-year negotiation.
813714967	26	So that is an option.
813714967	27	However, if Britain’s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.
813714967	28	Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.
813714967	29	The whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.
813714967	30	regulations, E.U.
813714967	31	taxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
813714967	32	In the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.
813714967	33	This plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.
813714967	34	However, few people like Theresa May’s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.
813714967	35	That brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.
813714967	36	It is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.
813714967	37	would agree to extend the March 29 date.
813714967	38	That would give time for more debate.
813714967	39	Some people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.
813714967	40	The problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.
813714967	41	Would it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?
813714967	42	Or would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?
813714967	43	So really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to “fudge,” or to kick the can down the road.

813714967	45	Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
813714967	46	A big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.
813714967	47	There are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants €15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.
813714967	48	At the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.
813714967	49	However, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.
813714967	50	This is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.
813714967	51	It is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.
813714967	52	border force has been patrolling the waters.
813714967	53	But political pressure has forced Britain’s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.
813714967	54	Many of the migrants are from Iran.
813714967	55	This is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa-free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.
813714967	56	More than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.
813714967	57	The trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross-currents can make the trip much longer.
813714967	58	The trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.
813714967	59	If a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.
813714967	60	When a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.
813714967	61	Iranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran’s human rights record.
813714967	62	For that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.

813949697	1	Police training up for deployment to NI in case of no-deal Brexit
813949697	3	Almost 1,000 police officers are being trained up for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of violence stemming from a no-deal Brexit.
813949697	4	Chiefs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland had asked for the reinforcements to handle any problems that may arise from a hard border.
813949697	5	It is thought large numbers of officers from Britain on the streets could anger Irish republicans.
813949697	6	But additional officers are thought to be necessary to cover the possibility of violence with a no-deal Brexit.
813949697	7	Cars burn during Nationalist rioting in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast, Northern Ireland on July 12, 2010.
813949697	8	The rioting started after the police forced the Protestant Orangemen's traditional 12 July parade against the wishes of a group of Nationalist residents
813949697	9	The training will mean officers are pulled from their regular duties, according to The Guardian.
813949697	10	News of the continued no-deal Brexit preparations came on another difficult day for Theresa May.
813949697	11	What is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?
813949697	12	The so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.
813949697	13	This is what it means: What is the backstop?
813949697	14	The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal.
813949697	15	The divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition if that deal is not in place.If effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market..
813949697	16	This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.
813949697	17	It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.
813949697	18	Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it?
813949697	19	Because Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.
813949697	20	This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal.
813949697	21	But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.
813949697	22	Why do critics hate it?
813949697	23	Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.
813949697	24	Getting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.
813949697	25	Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom..
813949697	26	What concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?
813949697	27	During the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.
813949697	28	Importantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea - even if some goods still need to be checked.
813949697	29	The Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments - meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.
813949697	30	It also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal - promises it says can be enforced in court.
813949697	31	What did the legal advice say about it?
813949697	32	Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.
813949697	33	This would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.
813949697	34	The DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.
813949697	35	After a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.''
813949697	36	Mr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.
813949697	37	However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.
813949697	38	Mr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.
813949697	39	He said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'
813949697	40	Mr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.
813949697	41	The remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.
813949697	42	Mr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.
813949697	43	A spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the leaders of the remaining 27 countries 'have been very clear' that what is on the table 'will not be renegotiated'.
813949697	44	At a press conference in Brussels, Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held before the Commons has its say on the deal in the week of January 14.
813949697	45	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	46	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	47	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: 'For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
813949697	48	She said Mr Juncker is 'always willing to listen to Mrs May's views on the backstop', but when asked what else he can do to help her deal get through Parliament, she rebuffed any chance of altering the backstop as it currently stands.
813949697	49	And Mrs May's deal drew criticism from Tory former minister Ben Gummer, who co-authored the Conservative manifesto at the last election.
813949697	50	Mr Gummer, who lost his Ipswich seat at the 2017 election, said it would leave the country poorer for generations.
813949697	51	He told the BBC: 'I think it is probably unique in modern parliamentary history, because Members of Parliament are being asked to walk through the division lobbies to make the country, and their constituents, permanently poorer and less secure.
813949697	52	'Not just in one generation, but in two or three.'
813949697	53	Mr Gummer said if Parliament failed to find a route through the Brexit situation, a new referendum should be held.
813949697	54	The comments came as Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be 'considerable' in the agricultural sector.

813949697	57	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal, Dublin warns
813949697	58	Irish agriculture minister Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit
813949697	59	Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc, the country's agriculture minister warned today.
813949697	60	Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit - with beef, dairy and fishing among the most vulnerable sectors.
813949697	61	The warning came as Brussels again appeared to dismiss Theresa May's plea for fresh concessions to help her get the Brexit package through the Commons later this month.
813949697	62	An EU commission spokeswoman also said there were no plans for any further negotiations with the UK - despite the PM insisting talks are ongoing.
813949697	63	The latest standoff has sent the chances of a no-deal Brexit spiralling, as Mrs May looks down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14.
813949697	64	Killing off the plan could throw the government into chaos, with the UK set to crash out of the bloc by default at the end of March unless politicians can agree another course.
813949697	65	Irish PM Leo Varadkar is seen as having been one of the main obstacles to sealing a deal, after he insisted on a 'backstop' to guarantee no hard border with Northern Ireland.
813949697	66	The DUP has condemned the proposals because they risk splitting the UK, while Brexiteers say it will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere.
813949697	67	However, the intervention by Mr Creed today underlines the threat of disruption Ireland faces if there is no Brexit deal.
813949697	68	Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) is looking down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14
813949697	69	Speaking about the need for support from the EU in the event of no deal, he told the Irish Independent: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
813949697	70	'Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
813949697	71	Nearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain, according to 2016 government figures.
813949697	72	The country is also considered a vital 'land bridge' to the European continent
813949697	73	'There is a high level of awareness of Ireland's unique exposure to the UK food market,' Mr Creed said.
813949697	74	'I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.'
813949697	75	But, he added: 'In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.
813949697	76	If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April.
813949697	77	Dublin outlined its no deal contingency plans before the Christmas break.
813949697	78	They include schemes for port overhauls, a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island's integrated electricity network.
813949697	79	Up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required.
813949697	80	At a press conference in Brussels this morning Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held with the UK before the Commons vote.
813949697	81	She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
813949697	82	'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
813949697	83	Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, and confirmed Brussels is ready to start preparations on a new trade deal 'immediately after the signature' on the deal from the UK Government.
813949697	84	She added: 'For now no further meetings are foreseen between the commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
813953273	1	RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The capital sees its first stabbings of the year
813953273	3	Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang from gatecrashing a party in Mayfair
813953273	4	The Page One headline in the Evening Standard said it all: ‘First Stab Victims Of The New Year.’ Welcome to 2019.
813953273	5	Call me old-fashioned, but when I worked on the Standard, admittedly in prehistoric times, the front page was more likely to feature the first baby born in one of London’s maternity hospitals.
813953273	6	On Wednesday, the photographs were of a security guard and a young mother knifed to death within a few miles of each other.
813953273	7	Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang dressed in designer clothes from gatecrashing a sordid sex party at an exclusive address in Mayfair.
813953273	8	Charlotte Huggins was murdered in her own home in Camberwell, South London.
813953273	9	Both victims were 33 years old.
813953273	10	Elsewhere, a man was stabbed in the street in Blackheath and was said to be critically ill in hospital.
813953273	11	Mr Simionov had only been in Britain for two months, moving here from Romania with his fiancee in search of a better life.He died at the scene, in Park Lane, after being attacked by up to ten men — including, allegedly, the 26-year-old son of Finsbury Park firebrand Captain Hook, the Islamist hate preacher currently serving life for terrorism offences in an American supermax jail.
813953273	12	His son, Imran Mostafa Kamel, was remanded on firearms charges yesterday and remains a suspect in the murder..
813953273	13	Two other security guards and a woman aged 29 were also stabbed and were treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries.
813953273	14	Flowers left on the pavement outside the entrance of the party in Mayfair, where security guard Simionov was stabbed to death
813953273	15	Park Lane, like the rest of central London, was teeming with drunken revellers seeing in the New Year.
813953273	16	The manager of a local garage said he had called the police to a crowd fighting and menacing his customers a couple of hours before the fatal stabbing.
813953273	17	He said they came and went around 3am.
813953273	18	To be fair, police resources are always stretched at New Year.
813953273	19	But routine foot patrols are thin on the ground at the best of times.
813953273	20	I was at a black tie ball in Park Lane shortly before Christmas.
813953273	21	When I left after midnight there was no sign of a copper anywhere.
813953273	22	Pounding the beat has long since slipped down the Met’s list of priorities.
813953273	23	These days they tend to respond to crime after the event, rather than seeking to prevent it.
813953273	24	That’s not to question the bravery of individual officers, as exemplified by the British Transport Police who tackled the Islamist nutjob who stabbed three people, including a police sergeant, at Manchester’s Victoria station this week.
813953273	25	But a visible police presence may have deterred the gang who killed Tudor Simionov.Sadiq Khan arrives for a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix Park, Dublin
813953273	27	No doubt London’s two-bob chancer of a Mayor Sadiq Khan would blame the absence of police on the streets on ‘austerity’ or the ‘Tory cuts’.
813953273	28	Maybe if he hadn’t splurged £2.3 million of taxpayers’ money on a vainglorious New Year fireworks display, he could have diverted more money to the Met to put extra bobbies on the beat.
813953273	29	Some of this largesse was frittered away turning the London Eye into a blue and yellow EU flag, as part of a cynical, self-serving propaganda stunt aimed at bolstering the Stop Brexit campaign and burnishing the image of the Mayor himself.
813953273	30	I wonder if Tudor Simionov was aware of Khan’s New Year message boasting that London would remain open after Brexit, broadcast in a number of foreign languages, including Romanian.
813953273	31	No one has ever suggested London won’t stay open when we leave the EU.
813953273	32	This was pure political posturing, at our expense.
813953273	33	The majority of Londoners may have backed Remain, but the really significant statistic is that more voted Leave (1.5 million) than voted for Khan (1.3 million).
813953273	34	What’s most likely to deter immigrants from coming here is not Khan slandering Leave voters as knuckle-scraping, racist bigots, but the news that someone can be stabbed to death on one of London’s busiest, best-known and most upmarket streets within two months of arriving in the country seeking a better future.
813953273	35	Under Khan, there has been an explosion of violent crime.
813953273	36	In addition to the New Year stabbings, a woman was shot in a nightclub in Hackney on the same night.
813953273	37	A day earlier, 39 people were arrested in Hammersmith on suspicion of attempted murder after another stabbing at a party.
813953273	38	We are all now familiar with the fact that last year London’s murder rate overtook New York.
813953273	39	There were 134 violent deaths in 2018, an increase of 15 per cent.
813953273	40	And if that chilling reality doesn’t put people off moving here from overseas, then perhaps they may be dissuaded by the paralysis on London’s roads and the exorbitant cost of housing — two key problems Khan has exacerbated, rather than solved
813953273	41	He promised 80,000 new homes a year, yet in the 12 months to last April built just over 5,300.
813953273	42	London’s economy may be steaming ahead (no thanks to Khan) but public services are deteriorating.The streets are dirtier, rubbish piles up uncollected late at night, public transport is horribly overcrowded and traffic is gridlocked as a deliberate consequence of the Mayor’s policies.
813953273	43	Rough sleepers and aggressive beggars are a permanent fixture in the West End.
813953273	44	Yet while innocent blood runs in the gutters, and police budgets are restrained, Khan indulges in fatuous propaganda stunts, whether floating a Donald Trump blimp over London or turning a traditional New Year’s party into a pro-EU festival of political hubris.
813953273	45	And instead of being able to celebrate an optimistic start to 2019, London’s evening paper has a splash headline marking the first stabbings of the year.
813953273	46	The first of many more to come, no doubt.
813953273	47	Makes you proud to be British.
813953435	1	Majority of Tory voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's deal
813953435	3	Conservative voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, a major survey reveals today.
813953435	4	In a rare glimmer of hope for the Prime Minister, the poll finds that Tory voters back her deal by 46 per cent to 38.
813953435	5	While a majority of voters across all parties (53 per cent) said Mrs May had failed to get a good deal – they also believed any alternative leader would have fared 'just as badly' in negotiations with the EU.
813953435	6	Tory voters back Theresa May's deal by 46 per cent to 38, according to a new survey
813953435	7	But an accompanying survey of Conservative Party members paints a far gloomier picture, with activists opposed to the deal negotiated by their own leader by 59 per cent to 38.
813953435	8	The research, co-ordinated by Professor Tim Bale of London's Queen Mary University, also reveals that Tory members are convinced a no-deal Brexit would be better than Mrs May's plan.
813953435	9	More than half of members polled (57 per cent) said their first preference was to leave with no deal.
813953435	10	Dublin 'mega-money' warning over Brexit Ireland last night warned Brussels it will demand 'mega-money' in the form of aid if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
813953435	11	Ireland's agriculture minister said a no-deal Brexit would have a crippling effect on his country's agriculture sector – which depends heavily on trade with the UK.
813953435	12	He said his country's farmers had been hit by the devaluation of sterling since Brexit, but said: 'A hard Brexit would make that look like a teddy bears' picnic.'
813953435	13	He added: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
813953435	14	Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
813953435	15	EU diplomats fear this could spark claims by other countries likely to be hit by a no-deal Brexit.
813953435	16	The figure is more than double the 25 per cent of the population as a whole who would plump for no deal.
813953435	17	The hardline stance of most Tory members will dismay Mrs May's allies, who had hoped that activists would use the Christmas break to pressure their rebellious MPs to fall into line.
813953435	18	But having the support of Tory voters – who will decide the party's electoral fate – does provide a crumb of comfort.
813953435	19	Downing Street will also be encouraged by a finding that 40 per cent of members said their second preference was to leave with Mrs May's deal, suggesting they could live with the compromise.
813953435	20	And the study found that if Mrs May's deal was pitted directly against the option of Remain in a second referendum, Tory members would grudgingly back her plan by 57 per cent to 18.
813953435	21	The PM was forced to postpone a vote on her Brexit deal last month after Tory whips warned she faced a crushing defeat, with more than 100 of her own MPs threatening to vote against.
813953435	22	The crunch vote is now due to be held on or around January 15.
813953435	23	But there are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart.
813953435	24	A senior source acknowledged that, with just ten days to go before the vote, the situation was 'still looking pretty challenging'.
813953435	25	Professor Bale said the findings indicated that activists were 'if anything, even less impressed than MPs' with her deal.
813953435	26	Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said the new polling made it clear Mrs May's deal was unacceptable to the party.
813953435	27	There are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart, according to a new survey
813953435	28	'If No 10 thought the Christmas and New Year break would make a difference then they have been proved wrong,' he said.
813953435	29	'The pressure coming from members is to kill off this deal, not support it.'
813953435	30	With 83 per cent of members opposed to a second referendum, it suggests any future leadership candidate proposing one would lose.
813953435	31	The research was produced by the Party Members Project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
813992175	1	Dreadful Brexit Deal: All EU States Could Ask UK For Trading Concessions - Prof
813992175	3	Barely two days have passed since the New Year and the remoaners are doing what they do best.
813992175	4	Fear mongering.
813992175	5	Unfortunately the British Parliament appears to be infested with them, as there is speculation that the government will begin a publicity campaign, aiming to warn of potential adverse effects of a no deal departure.
813992175	6	But would this outcome be as bad as so often claimed in the mainstream media?
813992175	7	And would it be preferable to Prime Minister Theresa May’s much maligned Chequers plan?
813992175	8	Sputnik spoke with UKIP founder Alan Sked for more insight on the issue.
813992175	9	Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of passing her Brexit deal?
813992175	10	And why is it so bad?
813992175	11	Alan Sked: It’s very difficult for her to pass it because it is very bad, as we have to pay the EU thirty nine billion pounds and we don’t get very much in return.
813992175	12	It sets up a two year transition period, during which we, in effect; remain members of the EU, but we don’t have any say in decision maker’s decisions that they take, we’d just have to accept whatever rules and regulations they pass without being able to influence or veto them.
813992175	13	© AFP 2018 / PRAKASH SINGH Indian Migrants Will Not Face Problems Until the Brexit Process is Over - Minister
813992175	14	Then there’s another thing that says; if we don’t get a free trade agreement by the end of the transition period, we’d enter a thing called the backstop that comes into play to safeguard the Irish border, which means that Britain and Northern Ireland become part of the single market and customs union.
813992175	15	We couldn’t get out of it; it goes on indefinitely and we’ve got no means of unilaterally exiting, we’d have to get the permission of the EU to come out, and if we want that permission, we’d have to get that permission from the twenty seven different countries, and each one of them could ask for trading concessions in order to get their permission, so it’s a dreadful deal.
813992175	16	Sputnik: Are WTO rules now the solution to the ongoing political deadlock?
813992175	17	Alan Sked: WTO’s a perfect solution.
813992175	18	We trade with America, China, India and most of the world under WTO rules already and different parts trade with each other on these rules.
813992175	19	The EU trades with America, China, India and different places on WTO rules; we’re set up to trade with large parts of the world already in that way so it won’t make very much difference.
813992175	20	I’d be very happy with WTO rules.

814251296	1	UK Govt to Perform No Deal Brexit Dress Rehearsal with 150 Trucks
814251296	3	The British government is going to wargame the impact of leaving the European Union on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on Monday, chartering dozens of articulated lorries to simulate the impact of traffic near the port of Dover.
814251296	4	After years of ignoring the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union fully and without a deal keeping it tied to the rules and regulations of the bloc, the British government is now apparently rushing to make preparations.
814251296	5	One of these is a trial by the Department of Transport to examine using the former Manston airport in Kent as a lorry park in case of congestion around the Port of Dover, one of the main points of cross-Channel traffic with Europe.
814251296	6	Up to 150 large trucks will be parked and released from the airfield at 0800 and 1100 Monday morning to test the utility of the site to relieve pressure on Kentish roads including the M20, which can become extremely busy when there are delays at the ferry port.
814251296	7	An email from the Department for Transport send to Cliffsend Parish Council reported by Kent Online said of the test: “The use of Manston airfield as an HGV holding facility is one of the traffic management measures as part of the current draft plan to alleviate congestion on Kent roads in the event of any disruption at the border.

814251296	9	“This also now includes if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, should there be any disruption… Staff will be positioned along the whole route throughout the trial to monitor flows.
814251296	10	If required at any time, flows from Manston can be halted as needed.”
814251296	11	The plan is a variant of Kent Police’s Operation Stack, which uses the M20 as a giant lorry park while leaving one lane open for other traffic in the case of the Port of Dover being closed to traffic.It was activated dozens of times in 2015 when industrial action and  illegal migrantscongregating at the Port of Calais — from which much of Dover’s traffic flows from and to — effectively halted the flow of ships and Eurotunnel freight trains.

814251296	13	The delays were so bad the British government even drew up plans to deploy the British Army to help control traffic in the south of England as instability in northern France prevented the free flow of trade.
814251296	14	As well as managing traffic in Kent to prepare for a potential resumption of border checks on trucks, the government has also handed out a number of contracts to reopen ferry routes to other ports, many of which have seen their services closed in recent years.
814251296	15	One of those is Ramsgate, which is now being dredged to take ships carrying 3,000 lorries a day after Brexit.

814403543	3	Prime Minister Theresa May may again push back the final House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement in face of continued opposition by Brexiteer MPs, according to sources speaking to The Telegraph.
814403543	4	MPs return to the House of Commons to debate the agreement next week and Mrs May’s aides are said to be drawing up a plan to make approval of the deal conditional on obtaining further reassurances from the European Union over the Irish backstop, according to the conservative broadsheet.
814403543	5	The vote was postponed in December in face of certain defeat relating to objections from Brexit-supporting MPs that the backstop could lock Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the bloc and threaten the Union.
814403543	6	With the vote pencilled in for the week beginning January 15th, Downing Street still has not come closer to assuaging those concerns, according to insiders, particularly for the 10 Northern Irish DUP MPs that May’s Conservative government rely on.
814403543	7	The prime minister’s advisors are considering making approval of the deal “subject to” May’s Government obtaining assurances that the Irish backstop will be temporary.
814403543	8	Former Downing Street director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa told The Telegraph, “Getting conditional approval isn’t enough for the Government to go ahead but it may be enough to show the EU there is a majority if they can move a little further.”
814403543	9	She added that it could allow the Government to “return for a third go at the meaningful vote, with a proven recipe for a majority” at a later date — despite there being less than three months until the UK formally leaves the EU.

814403543	11	Chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has said that Brexiteers have not gone soft over the Christmas break and still remain resistant to supporting the agreement, saying that more than 100 Tory MPs alone are expected to rebel and vote it down.
814403543	12	“During the recess I read reports that I could be open to supporting the Withdrawal Agreement and that I was even ‘a work in progress.’ It was at this time that it was reported that MPs when outside the Westminster bubble could be persuaded to back the deal.
814403543	13	“This never seemed likely and in my own case was wishful thinking, the backstop on its own is an intolerable failure of the negotiations,” Mr Rees-Mogg wrote in the Sunday Express.

814403543	15	Mrs May has doubled down on the scare tactics to push MPs into backing her Withdrawal Agreement, writing in the Mail on Sunday that critics of her deal were risking democracy and the economy.
814403543	16	“The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table,” she wrote adding that both Remain MPs pushing for a second referendum and Brexiteers wanting to honour the referendum result by making a clean break from the EU without a long transition tied to the bloc’s rules “must realise the risks they are running with our democracy and the livelihoods of our constituents.”
814403543	17	Meanwhile, a march organised by the pro-Remain People’s Vote, which calls for a second referendum, was revealed by The Telegraph to have only had a third of the attendees it claimed to while a petition calling for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March 29th, 2019, has gained more than 300,000 signatures.
814403783	1	MPs Threaten Government Shutdown to Stop No Deal Brexit
814403783	3	A group of Remainer MPs will attempt to stop a no deal Brexit by starving the Treasury of funds which could lead to “total paralysis” of the Government.
814403783	4	The MPs are set to vote on two amendments to the Finance Bill, which grants funds to the Treasury to spend on implementing no deal arrangements, on Tuesday.
814403783	5	Labour’s Yvette Cooper MP, who leads the group that includes former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin, and Nick Boles, said, “Our amendment would block some of the Treasury’s no-deal powers unless parliament has explicitly voted for no deal or unless the government has requested an extension of article 50.”
814403783	6	“We’ll be looking to table similar safeguards to all government legislation,” Ms Cooper added, with the Sunday Times reporting that the plans also have the backing of select committee leaders Hillary Benn, Rachel Reeves, Harriet Harman — all from the Labour Party –Frank Field (formerly of Labour), and Sarah Wollaston (Conservative).
814403783	7	Two members of Prime Minster Theresa May’s team told The Times on Saturday that the plan could lead to the “total paralysis” of Government.
814403783	8	A senior Government source added that Ms Cooper’s amendments would be “the first of many” attempts to stop a no deal Brexit should MPs vote down Mrs May’s unpopular EU Withdrawal Agreement in the week beginning January 15th.
814403783	9	There was no mention of a "deal" on the ballot paper.
814403783	10	The British public were given the binary choice of Leave or Remain.
814403783	11	Fantastic point from @PeterBoneUK on #Ridge this morning!#LeaveMeansLeave pic.twitter.com/yt5kEL7Mw9 — Leave Means Leave (@LeaveMnsLeave) January 6, 2019
814403783	12	May’s withdrawal agreement has found opposition from Brexiteers resulting in the prime minister postponing the House of Commons vote before Christmas in face of certain defeat — mainly over the issue of the Irish backstop which could see Northern Ireland locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc after the transition period, should London and Brussels not strike a deal, in order to stop a so-called ‘hard border’ with EU member state Republic of Ireland.
814403783	13	While the establishment media has taken to referring to the plot as a “Trump-style” government shutdown, the comparison misses a fundamental point: President Donald Trump’s shutdown is intended to push the American government to fulfil the will of the American people by securing the U.S.’s southern border, while Cooper’s team seeks to shut down the British government to frustrate the will of the people.
814403783	14	Both the Labour and Conservative parties’ 2017 General Election manifestos ran on pledges to respect the referendum vote and leave the EU; while Mrs May has been pushing MPs to accept her Withdrawal Agreement, a ‘no deal’ Brexit — the default legal position if the lower house votes down May’s agreement — is fulfilling the referendum result as Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.
814403783	15	“The only way you’re going to get on and deliver Brexit is what’s called a ‘no deal’ Brexit.
814403783	16	And then at the end of March we’ll be out of the EU and we will have left.
814403783	17	“There was no question, that I remember, on the referendum about a ‘deal’ or not; it was ‘leave’ or ‘remain.’ And the way you leave is to come out on the 29th of March.”
814403875	1	Brexit vote will ‘definitely’ happen, UK’s May says, as new poll shows most Britons would now vote to remain
814403875	3	British Prime Minister Theresa May said a vote on her Brexit deal will "definitely" happen next week, even as a new poll shows a majority of Britons would vote to remain in the European Union if there was a second referendum.
814403875	4	"We're going to be in uncharted territory if this deal does not go through," May warned in an interview with the BBC.
814403875	5	The British leader said that since the vote was pulled at the last minute in December, she's been consulting with EU leaders and British colleagues to get new assurances in three key areas, the details of which will be laid out in the coming days.
814403875	6	Those three areas include specific measures for Northern Ireland, a greater role for parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future U.K.-EU relations, and further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish backstop.

814403875	8	"When MPs come to look at this vote, they need to ask themselves: Does this deal deliver on the referendum?
814403875	9	Yes, it does.
814403875	10	Does it protect our jobs and security?
814403875	11	Yes, it does.
814403875	12	Does it provide certainty for businesses and citizens for the future?
814403875	13	Yes, it does," May explained.
814403875	14	Under forceful questioning from the BBC, May said that there should not be a second referendum.
814403875	15	A new YouGov survey showed that if a second referendum were held now, 54 percent of British citizens would be in favor of remaining in the European Union.
814403875	16	The poll, which was commissioned by People's Vote, an organization pushing for a new referendum, also found 41 percent thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote rather than leaving it in lawmakers' hands.
814403875	17	A deal setting out the terms of the United Kingdom's divorce from the EU has been agreed to between the prime minister and the EU, but it must pass a vote in Britain's Parliament before it is formally adopted.
814403875	18	Lawmakers are expected to vote on it either January 14 or 15.
814403875	19	The U.K. is due to leave the EU on March 29.
814403875	20	"Don't' let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good," May said.
814403875	21	"I want to see this deal go through."
814404002	1	Delingpole: Another Kamikaze Plot by MPs to Destroy Brexit with ‘Trump-Style’ Shutdown
814404002	3	‘An all-party group of senior MPs’ are plotting to sabotage Brexit by ‘starving the [British] government of cash and creating a Donald Trump-style shutdown’.
814404002	4	Do any of these gimps appreciate what a terrible look this is for representative democracy?
814404002	5	According to the Sunday Times, this group includes “former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper”, along with former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Wetwin and Nick Boles.
814404002	6	The idea is to vote on “two amendments to the Finance Bill that would lead to a gridlock in Whitehall unless Theresa May wins approval from parliament for a deal with Brussels.”
814404002	7	No, I have no idea either whether this plan is likely to succeed.
814404002	8	It could be just another of those “sounds big, means zilch” scoops that political editors come up with on a Sunday when there’s not much real news out there.
814404002	9	Or, for all I know, it could be the beginning of end of Brexit.
814404002	10	But either way, the standout point remains: parliament – the body of MPs whose ostensible purpose is to represent the interests of the British people – has gone AWOL.
814404002	11	Not just AWOL, actually, but completely barmy.
814404002	12	In order to advance its narrow, short-term aim of keeping Britain more or less within the European Union, parliament has decided to sever once and for all its relationship of trust with the electorate.
814404002	13	If these loser MPs weren’t so blinkered by their Remainer obsessions, they’d realise that the consequences for this will be far more serious and damaging than anything that might by caused by a “No Deal” – aka ‘hard’, aka ‘real’, aka ‘full English’ – Brexit.
814404002	14	Has there ever been a time in British history when parliament was so out of tune with the will of the people?Has there ever been a greater democratic deficit than when 17.4 million people voted for Brexit only to watch their parliamentary representatives so flagrantly, unapologetically and contemptuously seek to overrule them?
814404002	15	This isn’t just poor judgement.
814404002	16	It’s insanity.
814404002	17	Allister Heath made the case well before Christmas in a piece for the Telegraph titled ‘Hardline Remainers are becoming ever more extreme as time is running out.’
814404002	18	He likened the frantic desperation of Remainers to that of kamikaze pilots:
814404002	19	The intensity of their attacks is well beyond anything the Brexiteers can muster, which is why it feels like the pro-Remain counter-revolutionaries are winning.
814404002	20	To such true believers, nothing is taboo anymore, almost everything – careers, power, the Tory government, the capitalist order, even – is worth giving up to stop us from leaving the EU, especially without a formal deal.They have worked themselves up into such a frenzy that, shamefully, some would now prefer a neo-communist government to any meaningful Brexit.
814404002	21	There is a name for such preposterous loss of proportionality: it’s called Brexit Derangement Syndrome…
814404002	22	One of the many reasons the Remainers lost the Referendum was that they were quite unable to make a positive case for Britain remaining shackled to the crumbling, anti-democratic, arrogant, elitist, corrupt, sclerotic, mendacious, socialistic EU empire.
814404002	23	That’s what Projects Fear 1.0 and 2.0 were about: “Never mind the facts – here is some scary stuff we just made up to frighten you.”
814404002	24	Our only hope, I think, is to hold our nerve and never forget that whatever gibberish comes out of the mouths of our MPs – even ones we once thought we could rely on, like Brexiteer-turned-Mayite-sell-out Michael Gove – is just the delusional ramblings of a cowardly, self-serving, career-safe, unprincipled, spineless governing elite long, long past its sell-by date.
814404002	25	A poll last week by YouGov found that 57 per cent of Conservative Party members would prefer a no deal Brexit, whereas just 23 per cent would opt for Theresa May’s Brexit in name only “deal”.
814404002	26	Across Britain, outside the Remainer metropolitan strongholds, the people are still resolutely pro-Brexit.
814404002	27	You’d scarcely guess this from the mainstream media, even from those publications which originally came out for Brexit but which now are either rejecting it – eg the Daily Mail – or supporting it in name only – eg the Sunday Times.
814404002	28	We need to differentiate the signal from the noise.
814404002	29	The noise is all remain.
814404002	30	The signal is that Brexit – full, unapologetic Brexit – is still what most of us want.
814404002	31	Whether we’re going to get it, no one can predict.
814404002	32	But let’s not take at face value anything the pro-Remain Establishment – both MPs and media – tells us in the guise of dispassionate expertise.
814404002	33	They’re a bunch of shifty, cheating liars who are trying to sell their country down the river.
814404002	34	And one day, I hope, they will be made to pay for their treachery.
814427361	1	British PM warns of 'uncharted territory' if Brexit deal rejected
814427361	3	British Prime Minister Theresa May has reiterated that a delayed parliamentary vote on her widely maligned Brexit deal will go ahead later this month and warned the UK would enter "uncharted territory" should it be rejected by MPs.IIn an interview with the BBC on Sunday, May pledged to set out new measures to address the contentious Northern Irish "backstop" clause in her withdrawal plans in a bid to win over sceptical legislators.She also promised a greater role for the British Parliament in negotiations over future trade relations with the European Union.."If the deal is not voted on at this vote that's coming up then we are going to be in uncharted territory and I don't think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in parliament," May told the BBC.
814427361	4	Parliamentary opposition
814427361	5	The UK is poised to leave the EU on March 29, two years after it triggered Article 50, the exit clause in the EU's constitution, and kick-started arduous negotiations with European leaders over a divorce deal.
814427361	6	Last month, May pulled a vote on the brokered withdrawal agreement, settled on in November after more than a year of back-and-forth negotiations between London and Brussels, acknowledging it would have been roundly rejected by the UK's lower chamber House of Commons.
814427361	7	She later announced the vote would go forward in the week beginning January 14.
814427361	8	181214120018250
814427361	9	But parliamentary opposition to her deal remains fierce, with the main sticking point being the safety net "backstop" measure - which would guarantee no hard border is erected on the island of Ireland in the event that post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the bloc prove unsuccessful.
814427361	10	Critics of the backstop, which proposes that the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU "unless and until" the bloc agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border, argue it could tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely.
814427361	11	In an effort to assuage MPs concerns, May has lobbied her European counterparts and officials in Brussels to make concessions on the clause.
814427361	12	The EU, for its part, has insisted that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated but has made clear the backstop is meant only as a temporary measure of last resort.
814427361	13	DUP digs its heels in
814427361	14	The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which May's ruling Conservative Party relies on to command a majority in parliament, has urged the British leader to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its "poison" backstop provision on Ireland's post-Brexit border, however.
814427361	15	"The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the Withdrawal Agreement so toxic," DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement on Sunday.
814427361	16	"The coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff," he added.
814427361	17	The main opposition Labour Party has also pledged to vote down May's deal in parliament and threatened to initiate a no-confidence vote in her leadership should MPs refuse to back her plan.
814427361	18	181208084355355
814427361	19	Analysts said May's comments to the BBC did little to conceal the fact the British leader has no "gamechanger" amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement capable of swinging the parliamentary arithmetic in her favour.
814427361	20	"We are pretty much where we were before Christmas, with the proviso that there's less time left.
814427361	21	I don't see how the deal passes at the moment ... the interesting thing will be how much it loses by at the first attempt," Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London, told Al Jazeera.
814427361	22	"There are some MPs who are looking for an excuse to back the deal and so, something tokenistic and declaratory from the EU on the backstop clause would work for them, but I don't understand how that would work for the DUP, and that's where the action is," he added.
814427361	23	"Peeling off five of 10 Conservative Party MPs is neither here nor there, but if you get the DUP in line, May will give lots of parliamentarians an excuse to say, 'Well, OK, if they're happy with it I can't really justify going around moaning about the Irish backstop.'"
814427361	24	No-deal departure fears
814427361	25	Amid the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Britain's high-drama Brexit process, fears that the country could exit the 28-member EU bloc without a deal on the terms of its departure have continued to escalate.
814427361	26	181218142414510
814427361	27	The UK's central bank has warned that Britain's gross domestic product could shrink by up to eight percent in such a scenario.
814427361	28	The government, for its part, has forecast a potential economic slump of more than nine percent in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.
814427361	29	In a letter published by UK newspaper the Mail on Sunday, May warned critics of her departure plan risk damaging Britain's democracy and weakening its economy by opposing her deal.
814427361	30	She also alleged her deal was the only one that respects the UK's 2016 referendum result, in which 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU.
814427361	31	Growing calls for referendum rerun
814427361	32	But a new survey published by polling firm YouGov on Sunday suggested more Britons now want to remain a member of the bloc than leave it, however.
814427361	33	181201182945771
814427361	34	According to the research, which was commissioned by pro-second referendum campaign group the People's Vote, 46 percent of voters would opt to remain while 39 percent would vote to leave in the event of a rerun of the 2016 ballot.
814427361	35	When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favour of remaining.
814427361	36	The survey of more than 25,000 voters also showed that 41 percent of Britons thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote versus 36 percent who believe it should be up to parliament.
814427361	37	Removing those who are undecided, the split was 53 percent in favour of another referendum and 47 percent against.
814427361	38	Menon, however, argued the prospect of a second referendum being held remained slim.
814427361	39	"It's very hard to achieve - there isn't a majority in parliament for it … [and] it would require a significant extension of Article 50," Menon said.
814427361	40	"It's also impossible to say whether public opinion is in favour of a second referendum or not because answers to that question have varied basically as a function of the question that's being asked," he added.
814427361	41	"The polls split very clearly depending on the question you ask."

814435435	1	EXPOSED: Anti-Brexit March One Third the Size Organisers Claimed
814435435	3	The anti-Brexit People’s Vote march was just one-third of the size organisers claimed, it has been revealed.
814435435	4	The group, which pushes for a second referendum, claimed that 700,000 people marched on London on October 20th, 2018, but Scotland Yard confirmed to The Telegraph that the estimate is closer to 250,000.
814435435	5	“The Greater London Authority (GLA) has included an estimated attendance figure of 250,000 in a debrief document,” Scotland Yard said in a statement to the conservative newspaper following a Freedom of Information request.
814435435	6	“Please note this is not a Metropolitan Police Service estimate as we have not recorded an estimated attendance figure for the march,” the police force added.
814435435	7	The People’s Vote, launched in April 2018 by Remainer MPs Chuka Umunna (Labour), Anna Soubry (Conservative), and Caroline Lucas (Green), is supported by many of the key players in the Tony Blair-backed Remain continuity campaign Open Britain and pushed for a “public vote” on the final Brexit deal — i.e., a second referendum.
814435435	8	Labour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the march and hailed it a “historic moment in our democracy,” oversees the GLA.
814435435	9	The People’s Vote claims its wildly inaccurate estimations were “based on intelligence from both volunteers and professional stewards.”

814435435	11	Leave Means Leave co-chairman Richard Tice said of the revelation, “As we knew at the time, People’s Vote lied about its march size, [and it] appears [the] GLA covered up the truth.

814435435	14	Former UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage said, “People’s Vote lied about the number of supporters at their rally in London.
814435435	15	Hardly surprising, the pro-EU lobby have been lying to us for over 50 years.”
814435435	16	Meanwhile, a petition pushing for the UK to leave the EU in a clean break has reached more than 300,000 signatures.
814435435	17	MPs are set to return to Parliament next week to debate Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with a vote slated for the week beginning January 14th.
814435435	18	Dubbed “the worst deal in history” by Mr Farage, should it be voted down the legal default is a no-deal Brexit where the UK would leave on March 29th without a deal.
814435435	19	The UK would then trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms — the same as she trades with the rest of the world — and can immediately begin signing new, ambitious bilateral trade agreements with countries like the United States without having to be locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc during a near-two year transition period.
814630609	1	Government Sparking ‘Apocalyptic Fears’ over Clean Break from EU
814630609	3	Leading Brexit campaigners have said that the Government is sparking “apocalyptic fears” over the prospect of MPs voting against the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement and the UK making a clean break from the EU.
814630609	4	Writing in a paper published Monday entitled ’30 Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms’, Conservative peer Peter Lilley of Global Britain and Councillor Brendan Chilton of Labour Leave said that to break the House of Commons deadlock over the Irish backstop in Theresa May’s deal the United Kingdom should push for a Canada-style free trade deal.
814630609	5	However, if the EU is unwilling to renegotiate such terms, the Government should leave without a formal agreement — “No Deal” — and revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which Britain is already a member.
814630609	6	Lord Lilley and Cllr Chilton point out that leaving on “WTO+++” terms would mean not only saving £39 billion from the divorce bill envisaged in Mrs May’s deal, but also end the “corrosive economic and political uncertainty” of the two-year transition period, resolve the Irish border issue “by administrative measures without need for a backstop – as all parties have promised in the event of ‘no deal'”, and continue to trade with the EU on zero-tariff rates for up to a decade whilst negotiating a “Canada+++” trade agreement, as permitted under WTO Article 24.
814630609	7	REPORT: May Could Postpone Final Brexit Agreement Commons Vote Again https://t.co/WqOys2SpFn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 6, 2019
814630609	8	The Brexiteers debunked scare stories perpetuated by Remain politicians and establishment media by explaining that in the event of a WTO exit Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC )and the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs MRC (DEFRA) will not need to carry checks on all goods at the border, but only on goods if there is a perceived risk — with HMRC saying it will “prioritise flow over compliance” to prevent long queues at ports.
814630609	9	“Remain campaigners talk of chaos, catastrophe and Armageddon,” the authors wrote, and compared the “apocalyptic fears about leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement” to the hysteria which surrounded the Millenium Bug.
814630609	10	Economist Roger Bootle also wrote in The Telegraph on Sunday that the scare stories surrounding the Brexit debate echo those of europhiles who pushed for Britain to join the Eurozone 30 years ago, when then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, big business, and the mainstream media forecast economic disaster.
814630609	11	“Does this ring a bell?” Mr Bootle wrote.
814630609	12	“It should – an alarm bell.
814630609	13	Now we stand on the brink of another momentous decision.

814630609	15	Mr Chilton and Lord Lilley also criticised broadcasters for “cast[ing] aside their Ofcom obligations to balance and impartiality” by using loaded, anti-Brexit phrases to describe a WTO exit without a Withdrawal Agreement as “falling off a cliff-edge” or “crashing out”.
814630609	16	“In addition, this time the Government is clearly determined to play up the supposed horrors of leaving with no Withdrawal Agreement in the hope of persuading MPs to vote for the EU’s unloved draft ‘deal’.
814630609	17	“The government is in the bizarre position of preparing to leave on WTO terms, while pretending that its preparations will be unsuccessful,” they added.
814630609	18	Members of Parliament are returning to the House of Commons this week to begin debating Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with one Cabinet source saying “no-one at the moment thinks she will win the vote.”

814777937	1	The Far Right Is Trying to Co-opt the Yellow Vests
814777937	3	This weekend in Manchester, England, Yellow Vest protesters decorated their vests with logos of the far-right English Defense League.
814777937	4	In Edmonton, Canada, the Yellow Vest protesters were joined by members of the anti-Muslim group Wolves of Odin.
814777937	5	The Yellow Vest movement, which began as a nebulous economic protest in France, has found a new life with far-right groups abroad.
814777937	6	In Canada, the movement has spawned regular protests with a strong anti-immigrant message.
814777937	7	In the U.K., pro-Brexit factions have worn yellow vests to harass their rivals.
814777937	8	Participants in the Canadian and British demonstrations have also mixed the French movement with an unhinged American conspiracy theory.
814777937	9	The result is an international movement riddled with extremists, all feeding off the more popular French protests.
814777937	10	The original French Yellow Vest (“Gilets Jaunes”) demonstrations were not without their own far-right element.
814777937	11	Some of the movement’s earliest marches saw reports of racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, the New Republic reported.
814777937	12	A notorious anti-Semite was photographed as the face of the protests before journalists later recognized him.
814777937	13	A December poll found the movement had the highest favorability ratings with supporters of the far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
814777937	14	But the movement had a broader appeal.
814777937	15	The protests kicked off in November, sparked by a bundle of populist issues, including a new fuel tax and rising income inequality.
814777937	16	Liberal, leftist, and anarchist elements joined the protests.
814777937	17	A popular meme about the protests illustrated the movement’s allure to the political right and left, and to authoritarians and anarchists, alike.
814777937	18	This omnidirectional anger at French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist policies earned the Yellow Vest movement favorable polling in France—and admiration abroad.
814777937	19	Footage of the protests became popular on far-right and conspiracy Facebook pages in the U.S., where Americans highlighted some protesters’ anti-immigrant sentiments and promoted a hoax about Parisians chanting “we want Trump.” (President Donald Trump later repeated the false claim on Twitter.)
814777937	20	Pro-Yellow Vest memes are popular on Reddit’s biggest Trump page, r/the_donald.
814777937	21	In the U.K. and Canada, in particular, those far-right elements have taken their Yellow Vest admiration offline and onto the streets.
814777937	22	In London and Manchester this weekend, far-right Yellow Vesters rallied in favor of Brexit.
814777937	23	Some of the 40 attendees at the Manchester rally wore vests decorated with slogans by the English Defense League, a far-right Islamophobic group.
814777937	24	“If they want a war we’ll give them a war, let’s give them a fucking war,” one far-right Yellow Vest organizer shouted during a livestream of the London demonstration.
814777937	25	Last month, that same organizer was among a group of Yellow Vest demonstrators who accosted an anti-Brexit politician, calling her a “traitor.” Neo-Nazis previously used term to describe Jo Cox, an anti-Brexit politician who was murdered ahead of the 2016 Brexit vote.
814777937	26	“ U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	27	”
814777937	28	Meanwhile, the far-right group Wolves of Odin have been a persistent presence at Canadian Yellow Vest demonstrations every weekend, the Star Edmonton reported.
814777937	29	Some Canadian Yellow Vesters have denounced the Wolves of Odin, and leftist groups have used the Yellow Vest movement to push their own agendas in Canada and the U.K.
814777937	30	But the protests’ far-right elements remain highly visible.
814777937	31	Evan Balgord, director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network told the Star that the largest Facebook page for Canada’s Yellow Vest movement (which boasts more than 100,000 members) is rife with racism.
814777937	32	“If you go through it at any given moment, you’re going to find anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, you’re going to find death threats, you’re going to find other calls to violence, racism directed to Muslims—and it doesn’t take very long,” Balgord told the Star.
814777937	33	“I found my first death threat in five minutes.”
814777937	34	A brief scroll of the page on Monday afternoon surfaced anti-Muslim and anti-gay posts, as well as conspiracy theories about the New World Order.
814777937	35	U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest protests are also merging with another dysfunctional, foreign movement: the U.S.-based QAnon conspiracy theory.
814777937	36	The organizer of this weekend’s London Yellow Vest demonstration wore a vest with a QAnon slogan on it, the BBC’s Mike Wendling reported.
814777937	37	QAnon is an American conspiracy theory that falsely claims Trump’s rivals are involved in bizarre crimes, namely child sex-trafficking and cannibalism.
814777937	38	Despite the theory’s obvious falsehoods, failed predictions, and origins in the U.S., it has attracted international fans who believe QAnon’s claims about global crime rings and imminent mass arrests.
814777937	39	The theory has a growing Canadian fanbase, The Daily Beast previously reported, and Canadian Yellow Vest protesters have carried QAnon signs since at least mid-December.
814777937	40	Although QAnon is led by an anonymous forum user who claims to be a Trump insider, its followers have increasingly expanded on the conspiracy theory, making it difficult for even its original author to control.
814777937	41	“I really feel like we're heading for a Q movement where Q isn't necessary,” Mike Rothschild, a writer documenting QAnon’s evolution remarked on Twitter this weekend.
814777937	42	That leaderless conspiracy movement could end up looking a lot like elements of the U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest movements: nebulous in structure, but undeniably far-right.
814777937	43	A Friday picture of a Canadian Yellow Vest protester showed the movement’s possible future.
814777937	44	Far from the economic populist platform of France, the demonstrator’s vest was decorated with a jumble of Trumpian and conspiratorial language.
814777937	45	“Q,” the vest read.
814777937	46	“No Trudeau.
814777937	47	CBC = Fake News.”

815412286	3	A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security “in foreign hands.”
815412286	4	The letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May’s controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as “our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA” and urges MPs to vote against the deal.
815412286	5	BRITISH PM THERESA SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
815412286	6	The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens,” the letter says.
815412286	7	“The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.”
815412286	8	The deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May’s Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged.
815412286	9	The so-called “backstop” to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U.
815412286	10	permanently.
815412286	11	Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U.
815412286	12	“a veto over our ability to exit.”
815412286	13	Dearlove and Guthrie say that the deal “threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships.” According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is “the exact opposition of the people’s instruction to take back control” when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.
815412286	14	In response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs “is completely wrong.”
815412286	15	SPAIN AGREES TO BACK BREXIT DEAL AFTER SECURING CONCESSIONS FROM BRITAIN, EU
815412286	16	The letter is the latest blow to May’s push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.
815412286	17	She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.
815412286	18	Should she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament.
815412286	19	That could, in turn, lead to a general election.
815412286	20	Those who have opposed Brexit have renewed calls for either a second referendum or a delay in Britain’s departure.
815412286	21	May did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the “whole world” wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.

815412286	23	May told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:
815412286	24	"The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U.
815412286	25	has made clear is the only deal,” she said, before calling it a “good” deal.
815858385	1	British ‘Yellow Vest’ Who Called Pro-EU MP a Nazi Is Arrested by Police
815858385	3	James Goddard, the self-styled British Yellow Vest who caused outcry when he branded Remainer MP Anna Soubry a “Nazi”, has been arrested.
815858385	4	Goddard, whose actions were described as “a type of fascism” by the Speaker of the House of Commons, had challenged the MP for the Leave-supporting constituency of Broxtowe near the Palace of Westminster with a group of supporters, asking why she was working to stop Brexit despite claiming to support its delivery ahead of the 2017 snap election, and branding her a “Nazi”.
815858385	5	The consequences were swift for the protestor — described as “far right” by most media outlets — with his Facebook and PayPal pages both being taken down within hours of the incident going viral.
815858385	6	Video footage of the arrest now appears to show Goddard being put in the back of a police van by an extremely large number of police officers.
815858385	7	The Met has confirmed “that a man in his 30s was arrested at 11.42hrs on Saturday, 12 January outside St James Park Tube station on suspicion of a public order offence” committed on January 7th — although they declined to name Goddard explicitly.

815858385	10	Goddard has defended his characterisation of Ms Soubry, saying the Tory MP had “shown [herself] willing to fight in favour of vested corporate interests, against the will of the people, and she is now trying to shut down legitimate free speech because it is inconvenient for her… those showing fascist, totalitarian, globalist tendencies should and will be compared to their greatest 20th-century counterparts: the National Socialist Party of Germany.”
815858385	11	Some observers who are not even especially sympathetic to Goddard and his boisterous group have raised concerns about the furious reaction to their protest.
815858385	12	Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, for example, remarked on the apparent contrast between the swift retribution when people targeted an EU loyalist politician with the many years where Brexit campaigners like himself were branded Nazis and “racist scum” without punishment or any particular sympathy from the mainstream media.
815858385	13	“MPs, public figures, should be free to go about and express their opinion without the threat of violence — but if we try now to put in place laws, or if the police start prosecuting people, for throwing terms of abuse, that reaction, I think, would be over the top,” he warned.

816460196	1	Theresa May faces catastrophic defeat in major Brexit vote as allies warn: ‘Winter is Coming’
816460196	3	Prime Minister Theresa May was facing a significant and potentially catastrophic defeat on a major Brexit vote in Parliament Tuesday, a defeat that could eventually lead to anything from no Brexit at all to a general election -- as May's allies took a page from “Game of Thrones” and ominously warned: “Winter is Coming.”

816460196	5	leaders, ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.It is a vote that May is expected to lose heavily, but the severity of the loss is likely to determine the extent to which May is able to go back to Brussels and demand further concessions to try again to get the agreement through Parliament..BRITISH MP DELAYS GIVING BIRTH BY TWO DAYS TO VOTE AGAINST BREXIT DEAL
816460196	6	May has been criticized by both sides of the debate for her handling of the implementation of the 2016 referendum, with Remain supporters accusing her of presiding over chaos, with pro-Brexit factions in her own Conservative Party claiming that she has kowtowed to Brussels and that her deal does not actually lead to Brexit being delivered.
816460196	7	“I’ll be voting against the withdrawal agreement because I don’t believe it delivers Brexit,” Conservative MP and top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on the BBC Tuesday.
816460196	8	The anger from the “Brexiteer” wing focuses primarily on the inclusion of a “backstop” -- a safety net that keeps Britain in a customs union with the E.U.
816460196	9	in case no trade deal is made after March.
816460196	10	It is intended to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but Brexiteers have pointed to the lack of a unilateral exit mechanism as evidence that the backstop will lead to Britain never actually leaving.
816460196	11	If May's agreement loses by more than 100 votes, it would likely renew calls from her own party for her to step down, and give impetus to the opposition Labour Party to put forward a motion of no-confidence -- a move that could eventually lead to a General Election.
816460196	12	A Sky News analysis Tuesday suggested she could lose by as many as 226 votes -- which would be the largest defeat in House of Commons history, and catastrophic for May.
816460196	13	EX-MI6 CHIEF SAYS THERESA MAY'S BREXIT DEAL 'THREATENS NATIONAL SECURITY,' HURTS US RELATIONSHIP
816460196	14	Others who support Britain remaining in the E.U.
816460196	15	have floated the idea of a second referendum, by which Brits would get a do-over on the 2016 referendum -- something May has rejected outright.
816460196	16	That proposal has been condemned by many Brexit supporters as an effort to scrub out the 2016 referendum, what they say is a trend in Europe by which voters are made to vote again and again until they vote the "right" way.
816460196	17	In the face of withering criticism, May and her allies have been pushing back, hoping to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum.
816460196	18	May told a packed House of Commons ahead of the vote that "I believe we have have a duty to deliver on the choices of the British people."
816460196	19	She also criticized Labour Party calls for a general election.
816460196	20	"At the end of a general election, the choices facing us will not have changed," she said.
816460196	21	Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who is a May supporter and also campaigned for Brexit in 2016, sought to rally Brexiteers to May’s side, using a "Game of Thrones" reference to warn that the damage would be significant.
816460196	22	“I think if we don't vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, 'winter is coming,’” he said on BBC's Radio 4, “I think if we don’t for vote the deal tonight, I think we will do damage to our democracy, by saying to people that we are not going to implement Brexit,” he said.
816460196	23	In the Commons on Tuesday, the bombastic Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave a thundering hour-long speech, in which he boomed a defense of the withdrawal agreement and sought to counter arguments against it: “It is what the people voted for and we by adopting this withdrawal agreement, can give it to them.”
816460196	24	Warning about the dangers to Brexit and to the country of voting down May’s deal, Cox asked: “Do we opt for order or do we choose chaos?'
816460196	25	MAY SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
816460196	26	To his own party, particularly the Brexit wing, he turned to the Tory benches and asked: “What are you playing at?
816460196	27	What are you doing?”
816460196	28	A defeat also makes it unclear of the future for not only May, but also Brexit.
816460196	29	Should the agreement fail, Britain is set to leave without a deal with the E.U., something that Remainers and some business groups have said would lead to chaos from an economic downturn to a lack of access to vital medicines as Britain’s ports clog up.
816460196	30	MAY SLAMS TONY BLAIR'S NEW BREXIT VOTE CALL
816460196	31	Those on the right of the Tory Party have downplayed the risks of no deal, noting that Britain would revert to normal World Trade Organization terms and the benefits of leaving the E.U.
816460196	32	would outweigh any difficulties.
816460196	33	“Cutting the costs of imports from outside the E.U., making our economy more competitive, is going to be extremely beneficial,” Jacob Rees Mogg told the BBC.
816460196	34	“All the gloomsters, the prophets of doom, are the people who prophesied doom before and they’ve been wrong in all their earlier forecasts.”
816460196	35	May's supporters have argued that her way is the only way to avoid no-deal.
816460196	36	In the face of one Labour MP who blasted Attorney General Cox for failing to acknowledge the dangers of “no deal,” Cox shot back: “She can rule out no-deal today, all she has to do is vote for this one.” He then accused the Labour Party of seeking to “drive this government onto the rocks, create the maximum chaos” and pave the way for an election.

816460196	38	May told Parliament that the only way to avoid no deal was the vote for hers, and emphasized the importance of the decision in Britain's history.
816460196	39	"The time has now come for all of us to make a decision, a decision that will define our country for decades to come, a decision that will determine the future for our constituents, for their children and grandchildren, a decision each of us will have to justify and live with for many years to come," she said.
816720060	1	Brexit: Goodbye United Kingdom, hello dis-United Kingdom
816720060	3	To grasp the real meaning of Brexit is to understand the history of a state born in mercantilism and sustained by centuries of empire and colonialism.
816720060	4	Chaos everywhere, consensus nowhere has and continues to define Britain’s stalling and tortuous attempt to depart the EU in an orderly fashion.
816720060	5	Such chaos should come as no surprise, however, because more than a harbinger of Britain’s departure from the EU, Brexit is a harbinger of the break-up of the UK.
816720060	6	Let me explain.
816720060	7	The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to give the UK its Sunday name, is the epitome of an artificial state.
816720060	8	It was and remains the product of the grafting together of divergent cultures, histories and national identities.
816720060	9	At inception, this grafting together was undertaken not in the interests of its peoples but in the interests of national elites eager to take advantage of the commercial opportunities of a unified polity with added manpower and resources in an age of empire.
816720060	10	The venality, greed and corruption of the Scottish ruling class in the late 17th- early 18th century delivered the Scottish people into the arms of the union with England without their support, establishing thereby the Kingdom of Great Britain.
816720060	11	This was reflected in the social unrest and riots that ensued in Scottish towns and cities both during the negotiations that brought into being the 1707 Act of Union, and upon its passage.
816720060	12	Read more
816720060	13	For the ruling elites of both Scotland and England the union of both parliaments into one had demonstrable commercial and strategic benefits.
816720060	14	The former had been left bankrupt after Scotland’s failed attempt at establishing its own overseas colony in Darien, Central America (modern day Panama) in the late 17th century.
816720060	15	In order to forestall national immiseration the need to gain access to England’s overseas colonies was thereafter considered essential.
816720060	16	Meanwhile the English were eager to prevent the possibility of Scotland being used as a staging ground for an invasion from the north by the French in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14).
816720060	17	Wales, the third nation that makes up the UK, had already been merged with England in 1536.
816720060	18	Ireland on the other hand was a subjugated English (latterly British) colony, and was officially brought into the orbit of what would then be known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.
816720060	19	In 1922, after a prolonged national liberation struggle in Ireland, the 26 counties that make up today’s Republic of Ireland achieved dominion status before winning full independence in 1948, while the remaining six counties that make up the entire island, or Ireland, were partitioned to become what is now Northern Ireland: hence the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of today.
816720060	20	This necessary historical detour out of the way, here is where things start to bear relevance to Brexit.
816720060	21	An unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution that saw Britain (UK) go on to forge an empire which at its height covered a quarter of the globe, was the forging of a unified working class whose unity transcended national, cultural and regional differences.
816720060	22	This class unity was the product of the country’s heavy industries – coal mining, steel, shipbuilding, etc.– and was expressed in common economic interests and struggles against a common enemy, the bosses and owners of those industries, in the context of the trade union movement..
816720060	23	It also began to manifest politically with the formation of the Labour Party at the start of the 20th century.
816720060	24	In tandem, forged over time, was a British national identity nourished by the countless wars the state’s ruling elite unleashed and waged over the centuries of an empire that existed not to spread civilization and modernity to the ‘dark peoples’ of the planet, as officially claimed, but as a juggernaut of exploitation, subjugation and oppression.
816720060	25	In those countless colonial wars working class men were used as cannon fodder in a dynamic that continues to the present day.
816720060	26	Read more
816720060	27	Margaret Thatcher destroyed this material basis of working class unity across the UK in the 1980s.
816720060	28	Her free market counter-revolution and resulting deindustrialization of the nation’s economy turned Britain into what it is today – a service economy underpinned by financialized capital.
816720060	29	The country’s trade union movement, which once wielded considerable economic and political clout, is but a shadow of its former self as a consequence, while the Labour Party was gutted of its founding principles by Tony Blair and his execrable centrist crew in the 1990s and on into the first decade of the noughties.
816720060	30	It is the remnants of this Blairite crew within the Labour Party who have and continue to be engaged in a concerted effort to undermine the party’s current socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn.
816720060	31	Such people, working alongside a reactionary Tory establishment, should be careful what they wish for.
816720060	32	Because in 2019 it is only Corbyn’s socialist program, offering economic and social transformation, that provides any hope of repairing the regional, national and cultural fault lines that correspond to the breakdown of the 2016 EU referendum vote.
816720060	33	The post-industrial north and midlands of England, parts of the country virtually untouched by investment and left without hope after being decimated by Thatcher, voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in a veritable scream from the bowels of austerity Britain.
816720060	34	Every one of Scotland’s 32 local authorities, meanwhile, voted Remain.
816720060	35	Wales, particularly post-industrial south Wales, voted for Brexit, while a five percent majority in Northern Ireland voted Remain.
816720060	36	It confirms that what was once the United Kingdom is now the dis-United Kingdom, with those previously mentioned national and regional differences informing its peoples’ identities and worldview over the identity of class to an extent previously unseen.
816720060	37	Brexit in this context is a sideshow, a pantomime largely being played out in parliament and the centrist mainstream.
816720060	38	As Karl Marx put it: “To call upon people to give up their illusions about their condition, is to call upon them to give a condition that requires illusions.”
816720060	39	The illusion that Brexit is actually relevant to the needs of those who’ve seen their lives devoured by the beast of neoliberalism and bludgeoned by austerity must soon give way to the unvarnished truth that the UK as we know it, is past its sell-by date
816720060	41	“A reactionary,” the great postwar Labour figure Nye Bevan once said, “is a man walking backwards with his face to the future.” Surveying a political class presently engaged in ripping itself apart over Brexit, who could argue otherwise?

817147979	4	Good Omen For Trump?
817147979	5	| Articles
817147979	7	The parallels between British and American politics are simply eerie.
817147979	8	In 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit—and guess what?
817147979	9	Since then, of course, the political classes in both countries have been conspiring to reverse the election results.
817147979	10	But Theresa May just suffered the greatest defeat of any British Prime Minister when her BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by the House of Commons 432-202.
817147979	11	Subsequently, May has survived a vote of No Confidence and the outlook is confused.
817147979	12	But clearly the Deep State has not yet tamed British populism.
817147979	13	A good omen for Trump?
817147979	14	May’s defeat was terrible enough, but it was even worse because the “payroll vote,” of Members of Parliament (= Congressmen) holding government office, is around 140.
817147979	15	Hence, BRINO only attracted around 60 backbenchers (who within reason can vote as they like).
817147979	16	The Spectator has a list, with names, of the 118 Tories to voted against May’s deal.
817147979	17	This gives May and her government a tremendous problem because ever since she came back with the draft deal she has been saying it is her way or the highway, stubbornly insisting that no other deal is available.
817147979	18	But such was the deal’s subordination of UK interests that many commentators argued would leave the UK as a vassal state.
817147979	19	[May’s Brexit deal: the legal verdict | The PM’s plan isn’t bad – it’s atrocious, by Martin Howe QC, Spectator, November 24, 2018]
817147979	20	This fiasco is largely due to having a Remainer PM (May opposed Brexit although she wasn’t brave about it) and a Remainer-dominated cabinet.
817147979	21	At best their heart isn’t in Brexit; at worst they are deliberately trying to sabotage it.
817147979	22	Similarly, many Trump Administration officials and GOP Congressional leaders have been all too obviously hostile to his agenda.
817147979	23	With a Leaver PM and a Leaver-dominated Cabinet, there would still have been a potential problem with Remainer-dominated Houses of Commons and Lords.
817147979	24	But it is doubtful that Remainers in Parliament would have been so blatant in their attempts to frustrate a straightforward Brexit.
817147979	25	The defeat of May’s deal is encouraging for Brexiteers inasmuch as the overwhelming result should have greatly lessened any thoughts May had of coming back with a few insignificant cosmetic changes.
817147979	26	However, it’s still a possibility.
817147979	27	And there are many other threats to thwart a true Brexit.
817147979	28	If there is a serious breakdown of party discipline, there is nothing to stop Remainer MPs doing anything they want because the House of Commons still has a substantial majority of Remainers.
817147979	29	But a bright spot for Brexiteers: the date for the UK’s leaving is fixed in an Act of Parliament.
817147979	30	Section 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal ) Act 2018 states ‘“exit day” means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m.’
817147979	31	To change the date of the UK leaving the EU requires either an amendment to or a repeal of the Act.
817147979	32	And unless the Brexit leaving date is changed, it does not matter what else happens, because there is a legal obligation on the UK to leave.
817147979	33	A second referendum cannot be held, an extension of Article 50 cannot be sought by the UK or granted by the EU and Article 50 cannot be revoked.
817147979	34	In addition Remainers, however aided and abetted by the unethical Remainer Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, cannot ultimately stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March.
817147979	35	There are serious obstacles to the House of Commons voting to amend or repeal the leaving date.
817147979	36	To begin with it would nakedly expose the Remainers’ anti-democratic partisanship.
817147979	37	Ever since the referendum, most Remainers have consistently bleated that they honored the result, although obviously hoping to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	38	Having their true feelings exposed will be more than embarrassing, because there are many constituencies (= Congressional districts), especially ones held by Labour MPs, that voted heavily to leave the EU while their MP voted Remain.
817147979	39	Leave voters might well punish Remainer MPs in Leave constituencies.
817147979	40	Then there is the entirely practical alternative option of a No-Deal Brexit—more precisely, leaving without any negotiated deal with the European Union and proceeding to trade under World Trade Organization rules.
817147979	41	Significant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready-made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.
817147979	42	Of course, WTO membership does not mean that future bilateral trade deals cannot be struck.
817147979	43	So what is really happening—in the U.K. and the U.S.?
817147979	44	The Deep State is often portrayed as a conspiracy.
817147979	45	In fact, it is better thought of as a blind sociological event.
817147979	46	There is no group of conscious conspirators, simply people being groomed to have the same opinions or at least saying they do.
817147979	47	What has happened in the UK (and the rest for the West to varying degrees) is the success of the long march through the institutions.
817147979	48	That is what ultimately has given the UK an elite (politicians, mediafolk, teachers etc) who are overwhelmingly Politically Correct internationalists.
817147979	49	And it’s those people who are at the forefront of the attempts to sabotage Brexit.
817147979	50	How did it come about?
817147979	51	A German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.
817147979	52	Eventually there would be enough of such people to change the policies of Western societies from national to internationalist ones.
817147979	53	That point was reached in the UK at least 50 years ago and the Politically Correct stranglehold on our society is now complete.
817147979	54	The capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has “anti-racism” (in reality anti-white racism) at its heart.
817147979	55	The last brick in the Politically Correct building is the increasingly draconian treatment of anyone who refuses to toe the line—increasingly including the use of the criminal law and imprisonment.
817147979	56	That is why Western politics until recently has been so ideologically monotone.
817147979	57	Brexit was a revolt against that mentality.
817147979	58	Most MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.
817147979	59	But by doing so, MPs forfeited their right to do anything other than honour the result of the referendum.
817147979	60	That applies just as much to Remainer MPs as Leaver MPs.
817147979	61	Sadly, the behaviour of the most committed Remainers with power and influence (including many MPs and peers in the House of Lords) has shattered utterly the idea that the UK is a fully functioning democracy.
817147979	62	Rather, it is an elective oligarchy whereby the electorate are offered an opportunity every few years to choose between competing parts of the elite—an elite in the UK whose general political ideas are largely held in common and go against the interests and wishes of most of the electorate.
817147979	63	None of this should be a surprise.
817147979	64	The sad truth: the central political question in all Western societies is—how far will the masses be able to control the naturally-abusive tendencies of the elite?

817176202	1	The British People, as Well as the Politicians, Don’t Want Brexit
817176202	3	The British Parliament just handed Prime Minister Theresa May one of the biggest legislative defeats in parliamentary history, by rejecting her Brexit plan.
817176202	4	These House of Commons politicians may simply be following the will of the British people, who now reject the idea of leaving the European Union only a few years after narrowly approving the plan in a referendum.
817176202	5	May should either call for a new referendum, or resign, if she cares about British democracy.
817176202	6	Europe Cut Off?
817176202	7	The British people have always had some ambivalence about joining the European Union.
817176202	8	It’s more about being independent than being anti-European.
817176202	9	This was best illustrated by a story my political science professor told me years ago.
817176202	10	After a violent storm in the English Channel, telecommunications between the island and the mainland were severed.
817176202	11	The headlines in Europe read “Terrible Storm: England Cut Off.” The United Kingdom newspapers touted the headlines, “Terrible Storm: Europe Cut Off.”
817176202	12	Polls going back to February of 2012 confirm this.
817176202	13	Opposition to the EU in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was much stronger, with 45 percent wanting to leave the EU and only 35 percent wanting to remain, with 20 percent unsure and the remainder saying they would not vote.
817176202	14	Opponents of the EU largely led the polling landscape from 2012 to 2015.
817176202	15	Subscribe to Observer’s Politics Newsletter
817176202	16	From 2015 to 2016, there was a seesaw battle between proponents of Brexit and opponents, who wanted to stay in the EU.
817176202	17	It seemed to change from survey to survey.
817176202	18	The supporters of leaving the EU narrowly won out, largely due to wild claims from Brexit supporters, like the UK Independence Party (UKIP), that the country would make a lot of money by leaving the EU.
817176202	19	In addition, support for Brexit was also fueled by opposition to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a free market champion and EU supporter who became pretty unpopular quickly due to a series of scandals, and his policies that struggled to help the UK recover from the Great Recession.
817176202	20	I went into a Conservative Party club in 2012 in Oxford and could barely find a Cameron supporter in his own party’s get-together.
817176202	21	I found just a tiny photo of him that had been moved to the back of the building.
817176202	22	Support for the EU Rises
817176202	23	But something happened after the Brexit vote.
817176202	24	Polls show that the number of undecided votes dropped precipitously, and support for the EU rose.
817176202	25	As people realized that voting for Brexit wasn’t like winning the lottery, and that the country was due to face a lot of economic pain for breaking with the European Union, support for Brexit slipped in the polls.
817176202	26	Additional polls consistently show that those favoring the EU would win a new referendum, as people realize the consequences of Brexit, as well as the false promises such a plan won’t deliver.
817176202	27	May, who assumed power after Cameron resigned, sought to capitalize on the Brexit vote by calling for early elections.
817176202	28	Instead, this Brexit cheerleader was humiliated at the polls, and her party lost its majority in power, relying on a Northern Ireland party to cling to power.
817176202	29	May sought to negotiate the Brexit plan with the EU.
817176202	30	But the plan was so unpopular in 2018 that she tabled it, hoping the House of Commons would like it better in 2019.
817176202	31	They liked it less, leading to May’s Waterloo in the vote.
817176202	32	Not since Tory Prime Minister Lord North received the news from Yorktown about the success of the American Revolution has a British politician been so humiliated.
817176202	33	Time for Another Vote
817176202	34	Failing to learn the lessons of her defeat, May refused to call for a new referendum, calling such a move “antidemocratic.” But what’s more antidemocratic: giving the people a new vote and a second chance, or leaving her tiny parliamentary coalition in charge of making the policy.
817176202	35	When it comes to democracy, to paraphrase from the film The Princess Bride, I would say “You keep using that word.
817176202	36	I do not think that words means what you think it means.”
817176202	37	Former Labor PM Tony Blair, and former Conservative PM John Major, have called for a new vote, showing a rare moment of bipartisanship.
817176202	38	Polls estimate that at least 55 percent of the British people want to stay.
817176202	39	It’s time to have a fake news-free referendum that doesn’t involve racism or the stabbing death of a parliamentarian who opposed Brexit.
817176202	40	Let the British determine their own fate before the end of March, and let’s not leave it up to a lame duck prime minister who doesn’t seem to command a quarter of the House of Commons.

817190270	3	A Briton Rejoices At BREXIT's Triumph | Articles
817190270	5	When I woke up on that warm 24th of June, at six o’clock, other than my regular neck ache, I felt something, a sense of disappointment.
817190270	6	I knew Leave had lost the referendum.
817190270	7	The exit polls had said that leave would lose.
817190270	8	The bookies had said we would lose.
817190270	9	My natural-born pessimism had seeped in.
817190270	10	Of course, I was in bed at this time.
817190270	11	I was left to my thoughts.
817190270	12	My own cynical thoughts.
817190270	13	I hadn’t actually bothered to look at the news.
817190270	14	That was until my sister came screeching in exclaiming, “We are leaving the EU!
817190270	15	You won!”
817190270	16	I had to make sure.
817190270	17	“It couldn’t be,” I thought.
817190270	18	“The people taking a stand?
817190270	19	No chance.
817190270	20	She must be pulling my leg.”
817190270	21	But lo and behold, it was true.
817190270	22	Utterly.
817190270	23	52% for Leave to a 48% for Remain.
817190270	24	I won’t lie, I did cry.
817190270	25	I’m not ashamed of it either.
817190270	26	I’m rarely made happy by the political discourse, but this was the rare exception.
817190270	27	I had actually had a sense of pride for the nation and the people who finally took a stand against its masters.
817190270	28	Lying there on my bed, since the power of this event had stunned me from getting up, I started to reflect on how far the movement to officially leave the EU had come to pass.
817190270	29	I recalled last year, at the start of the referendum campaign, right after the general election.
817190270	30	I was in a conference hall, partly funded by the EU, for a rally on our “Future Relationship with the European Union”.
817190270	31	It was a UKIP event.
817190270	32	I found the event powerful.
817190270	33	The smell of smoke filled the room.
817190270	34	Reporters were standing by.
817190270	35	It was full to the brim of people, young and old.
817190270	36	Nigel Farage, the man to thank for bringing us this referendum in the first place, gathered to do his speech.
817190270	37	Playing the song The Final Countdown by the band Europe, as he came down.
817190270	38	The crowd was in rambunctious cheers and applause as he talked.
817190270	39	They loved it.
817190270	40	As did I. I never considered myself a member of any movement until that day.
817190270	41	I loved the power it invoked in me.
817190270	42	I was with real people who truly believed in what they said.
817190270	43	They didn’t care about Political Correctness, they believed in doing what was right.
817190270	44	My mind fast-forwarded to one of the days where I leafleted in a city center.
817190270	45	In my gut, from the looks people gave me, the discussion with people on the busy street, even the diversity of the other leafleters, I felt that we were going to vote for Brexit.
817190270	46	Leave had the arguments and it had the people behind it.
817190270	47	Remain had University students prepping themselves for a degree in Politics.
817190270	48	I ignored my gut until the morning of the 24th and went with the bookies.
817190270	49	A wise choice for most instances.
817190270	50	But I was wrong, and I’m glad of it.
817190270	51	The white working class was truly key to this referendum, though, rejecting the usual, Center-Left consensus from their natural party, the extremely pro-European Labour party.
817190270	52	They picked the chance of controlling their own borders as they thought for the future of their own kin.
817190270	53	Only four of the constituencies in the poorest section of England, and Labour heartland, the North East, voted narrowly for a Remain vote, compared to the 11 constituencies that voted to leave.
817190270	54	Things were similar in the Labour heartland of Wales.
817190270	55	[EU referendum results and maps: Full breakdown and find out how your area voted, by Malcolm Coles and Ashley Kirk, Telegraph (UK) June 24, 2016]
817190270	56	The Left wasn’t the only one shook up by the rebellion.
817190270	57	Real Tories came out and defended their sovereignty in the south.
817190270	58	They rejected the “Great” deal made by Prime Minister David Cameron, who can now be seen to be a political failure—a deal that even Cameron’s own MPs had a hard time praising.
817190270	59	[EU deal: What David Cameron asked for... and what he actually got, by Peter Foster,Telegraph (UK), June 14, 2016 ] Though usually more loyal when it comes to Conservative policies, they decided they had had enough and voted with their hearts.
817190270	60	These people knew how the EU had harmed them.
817190270	61	They were not blind sheep who blindly follow their party’s whims.
817190270	62	They ignored the fear peddled by Obama, Cameron, Juncker, and every other “enlightened” expert.
817190270	63	They knew that none of those people lived or had even been to the areas affected by the EU.
817190270	64	The working class saw the EU applied, and they didn’t like it.
817190270	65	Nor did the real Tories in the south.
817190270	66	The economic arguments used by Remainers, meant and mean nothing if their own quality of life was being squandered because of cheap labor and living in perpetual fear from the dangerous effects of immigration.
817190270	67	When Britain joined what was then deceptively European Economic Community in 1973, Britain was still reeling over a lost empire.
817190270	68	We were stranded, and we stumbled onto what seemed like something we could latch onto.
817190270	69	However, that quickly changed.
817190270	70	The EEC became a unionist, empire-building political project.
817190270	71	Enoch Powell, famous for his “Rivers of Blood” speech on immigration, knew this.
817190270	72	He cost the Tory Party, which had he quit dramatically, the election by telling supporters to vote Labour in 1974, because it was offering a referendum on membership in the EEC.
817190270	73	Unfortunately, many didn’t see the upcoming globalist travesty that Enoch envisioned and in the 1975 referendum Britain gave a resounding “Yes” to the European Union (as it renamed itself, now frank about its political goal).
817190270	74	They never knew what they were truly getting into.
817190270	75	The small print was too tough to see.
817190270	76	The back door was closed on them.
817190270	77	But now that they have seen the EU’s aims, and actually feel the impact that the EU can have on the “serfs”, they gave Merkel the rightfully deserved two fingers (in America this would be one finger) to her, her bureaucrats, and her project.
817190270	78	This was a triumph for the nationalist movement and for nationalism in all countries—whether or not people who voted realize this.
817190270	79	This is bringing independence to the natural borders of nations.
817190270	80	You cannot merge different cultures and races in a top-down system centered around a utopian vision.
817190270	81	A nation can only truly look after its own.
817190270	82	Europe is not a nation, nor should it be treated as such.
817190270	83	After our historic vote, real nations, places like Holland, Denmark, and even France, are already asking for their national identity back from the globalists in Brussels and Germany in similar “Brexit” referendums.
817190270	84	This is not perfection, as I might seem to be portraying it.
817190270	85	Problems will be encountered.
817190270	86	We need a democratically-elected government that actually will control its own borders, instead of that we have currently.
817190270	87	Much of the damage is already done.
817190270	88	Instead of having a neoliberal economic policy, we need an economic policy that actually cares about Britain’s own industries.
817190270	89	In addition, we need a foreign policy, not made by NATO and the neocons of Washington DC.
817190270	90	The barrier of the EU would always prevent us from ever changing those matters.
817190270	91	Our own major parties would like keep this up also.
817190270	92	We can get rid of them though.
817190270	93	We could not get rid of Brussels.
817190270	94	Leaving the European Union is the right direction.
817190270	95	It is not the right destination for making Britain truly, great.
817190270	96	Nationalists should praise what has happened to the UK for what it is; a sign of the shifting tide of opinion that has been constantly ignored by elite opinion.
817190270	97	Hopefully Brexit will not be the last of the exodus.
817190270	98	The European Union has gone onto too long.
817190270	99	It is high time real nations broke free from its shackles.

817408115	20	We all know, by a process of elimination, what Tusk means by the "only positive solution."
817408115	21	That's Britain staying in the EU and sticking two fingers up at the 17.4m people, many of them from the most deprived parts of the country, who voted to Leave.
817408115	22	EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker meanwhile urged the UK to "clarify its intentions as soon as possible", warning that "time is almost up."
817408115	23	I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the @HouseofCommons this evening.
817408115	24	I urge the #UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible.
817408115	25	Time is almost up #Brexithttps://t.co/SMmps5kexn — Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) January 15, 2019
817408115	26	It's hard to escape the conclusion that the EU offered Britain such a bad deal because they knew it wouldn't be passed.
817408115	27	Then, maximum pressure could be exerted on theUK to reconsider its decision to leave, or at least kick Brexit into the long grasss, which is what having a second referendum would do.
817408115	28	Right on cue, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, and the front-runner to become Germany's next chancellor after Angela Merkel, has made an '11th hour' plea for Britain to stay in the EU.
817408115	29	The emotional plea, which lauds "the legendary British black humour" among other things, comes, appropriately enough, in a letter to the neocon propaganda organ the Times, which supported 'Remain.'
817408115	30	The European establishment is desperate for Britain to reconsider Brexit.
817408115	31	Internationalist ideals about 'preserving European unity', don't come in to it, this is all about protecting income streams.
817408115	32	Read more
817408115	33	Consider a few facts.
817408115	34	If Britain does leave without a deal, then the EU as an institution would be considerably worse offThe UK has consistently been one of the top three countries that puts most into the EU budget (after Germany and France).).
817408115	35	It is one of ten countries that puts more into the EU than it gets out.
817408115	36	In 2017, the UK's net contribution was £9bn.
817408115	37	If Britain leaves, the EU faces a financial shortfall.
817408115	38	In 2016, 16 countries were net receivers, including Donald Tusk's Poland.
817408115	39	Little wonder that he regards Britain staying as "the only positive solution".
817408115	40	The very generous financial remuneration packages of EU officials might also be threatened by British withdrawal.
817408115	41	n December, it was reported that the EU's top civil servants would be paid over €20,000 a month for the first time, and that Tusk and Juncker would see their packages rise to €32,700 a month.
817408115	42	Austerity?
817408115	43	Not in Brussels, mon ami!
817408115	44	The EU is a fabulous gravy train once you are on board.
817408115	45	But the gravy train relies on its richest members not leaving, otherwise who's going to foot the bill?
817408115	46	If Britain leaves with 'No Deal', it's not just the EU budget which will take a hit.
817408115	47	In 2017, EU countries sold around £67 billion more in goods and services to the UK, than the UK sold to them.
817408115	48	Europe needs full and unfettered access to British markets, much more than Britain needs full and unfettered access to European markets.
817408115	49	Read more
817408115	50	That's not being 'nationalistic', but simply stating the economic reality.
817408115	51	The country that would lose out the most with Brexit is Germany.
817408115	52	Britain's trade deficit with Germany is higher than with any other country, even higher than China, whose products are everywhere in our shops!
817408115	53	In 2016, the year of the EU referendum, Britain imported around £26 billion more from Germany than it exportedIt's no great surprise therefore to see the president of the Federation of German Industries as one of the signatories of the letter to the Times, pleading for Britain to stay!y!
817408115	54	Repeat after me: "We would miss Britain as part of the European Union.
817408115	55	We would miss Britain as part of the European Union"We also have to discuss fishing.
817408115	56	The other EU countries do extremely well out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides them with access to UK waters.
817408115	57	Belgian fleets get around half their catch from British waters!
817408115	58	As reported in the Independent, the Common Fisheries Quota has for the past 34 years given 84% of the cod in the English Channel to France and just 9% to the UK.
817408115	59	Overall, EU vessels take out around four times as much fish out of UK waters as British vessels take out of EU waters.s.
817408115	60	Again, you don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the EU doesn't want Britain to leave.
817408115	61	If the EU's commitment to democracy was genuine, they would have done everything they could to make sure the referendum result of June 2016 was implemented.
817408115	62	But the financial hit of Britain leaving is too high.
817408115	63	So, instead they have done everything possible to subvert the democratic will of the people, while at the same time boasting about their commitment to 'democracy.'
817408115	64	Good news for democracy: Parliament is proposing EUR 1.8 billion funding for a new Rights and Values MFF Programme.
817408115	65	Civil society will be our strongest ally to protect the #RuleOfLaw & fundamental rights across the EU!
817408115	66	https://t.co/7UQLP71GMK — Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) January 17, 2019
817408115	67	Of course, the EU is not the only party to blame.
817408115	68	The British government, led by a Remainer, and with Remainers holding prominent positions in the Cabinet, has been pusillanimous.
817408115	69	Theresa May has shown she is desperate for a 'deal' whereas in fact, the ones who really need an agreement to provide continued unfettered access to lucrative UK markets, are the EU.
817408115	70	If the UK government had called Brussels' bluff and announced that Britain would just leave, you can be sure Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and co would have come running with a much better offer.
817408115	71	Their (very high) salaries, and the profits of European businesses, depend on it.

817449755	1	Derbyshire Cheers For Hard Brexit | Blog Posts
817449755	3	The fuss about Brexit over in the U.K. is of only indirect interest to us Americans, but it does show another aspect of the slow political revolution taking place all over the Western world.
817449755	4	As our own correspondent Robert Henderson posted here at VDARE.com on Thursday, the Brexit vote of June 2016—the vote by British people to leave the European Union—was of a piece with the election of Donald Trump five months later.
817449755	5	Both events represented a revolt by ordinary citizens against entrenched Deep State elites and their media, corporate, and academic shills.
817449755	6	Two-plus years on, it's clear on both sides of the Atlantic that those entrenched elites were more entrenched than the revolutionaries supposed.
817449755	7	Both in the U.S.A. and Britain, they have put up a mighty resistance to the loss of their power and influence.
817449755	8	So which revolution is doing better, ours or theirs?
817449755	9	On the evidence of this week, I'd have to say Britain's is ahead.
817449755	10	British Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated a deal with the EU, a package of conditions under which Britain could finally leave the EU on March 29th.
817449755	11	It was a lousy deal for the Brits, keeping the nation chained to the EU bureaucracy in a hundred ways.
817449755	12	"BINO" I called it back in December—Brexit in Name Only.
817449755	13	Robert Henderson prefers BRINO, and I'm okay with that: the perception is the same.
817449755	14	Tuesday this week Britain's parliament finally got to vote on Mrs May's deal.
817449755	15	They voted it down.
817449755	16	That generated a mini-crisis as the opposition party in parliament called a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
817449755	17	That vote, however, went Mrs May's way, so she remains in power.
817449755	18	But since parliament's rejected her deal, what are the terms under which Britain will leave the EU on March 29th?
817449755	19	A strong possibility now is: no terms.
817449755	20	This is the so-called "hard Brexit."
817449755	21	Britain just walks out, leaving the bureaucrats and businessmen to sort things out among themselves as best they can.
817449755	22	There would be chaos and confusion; but, as Adam Smith said, there's a deal of ruin in a nation.
817449755	23	The Brits have faced far worse within living memory.
817449755	24	When the dust settled they'd have their sovereignty back, and could set their own laws in their own parliament for their own people again.
817449755	25	That would be worth a bit of chaos.
817449755	26	A great many Brits agree.
817449755	27	Here's a sound clip from last week.
817449755	28	It's from a weekly show on BBC-TV called Question Time, in which a panel of pundits and politicians takes questions from a studio audience.
817449755	29	This being the BBC the panels are slanted left-liberal, making it usually a pretty dull show.
817449755	30	This Thursday's Question Time panel, however, included political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.
817449755	31	Following those earlier events of the week, the question of course came up: Is there now any alternative to a "hard Brexit"?
817449755	32	Ms Oakeshott took the question.
817449755	33	Here's what she said:
817449755	34	Oakeshott: Well, the answer … look, I can save everybody a lot of time here …
817449755	36	Emcee: Oh, do!
817449755	37	Because it's been two years, so, so, …
817449755	39	Oakeshott: The short answer is: No, there isn't.
817449755	40	And that is why it seems to me the only option for Theresa May now—and I'm going to admit that it is a sub-optimal position—is to walk away.
817449755	41	That is all she can do.
817449755	43	Emcee: So to leave with no deal.
817449755	45	Oakeshott: Yes, absolutely, because that isn't … (Drowned out by prolonged cheering and applause from the studio audience.)]
817449755	46	Just listen to that studio audience!
817449755	47	Hard Brexit?
817449755	48	They love it!
817449755	49	The TV coverage is even more telling.
817449755	50	They're happy, with the happiness of people who just heard an authority figure—Ms Oakeshott is the privately-educated offspring of an upper-class family—an authority figure taking their side against the elites.
817449755	51	I can't forbear adding that Question Time is a peripatetic show, set in a different city each week.
817449755	52	Thursday's show was set in Derby, which is of course the capital city of Derbyshire …
817449755	53	It's worth adding also that the Brits seem still to have some of their resourcefulness in the face of impending chaos.
817449755	54	The London Daily Mail, January 18th, reports a severe shortage of warehouse space in Britain on account of British firms stockpiling all kinds of goods, including food.
817449755	55	The firms fear that chaos over the absence of customs rules at ports of entry following a hard Brexit will slow down or stop entry of goods.
817449755	56	That's private action, not government action; but I'm reminded of Margaret Thatcher and the crisis with Britain's coal miners in the early 1980s.
817449755	57	When the miners' union leaders first started acting up, Thatcher appeased them with soft talk.
817449755	58	Meanwhile, behind the scenes, she called in her Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson and told him to start stockpiling coal.
817449755	59	When the stockpile was big enough, Thatcher turned on the miners and confronted them boldly, from a position of strength.
817449755	60	She was a smart lady, and that's smart government.
817449755	61	You listening, Mr President?
818141325	1	Prime Minister May's 'Brexit Plan B' looks a lot like 'Brexit Plan A'
818141325	3	British prime minister Theresa May unveiled her Brexit Plan "B" yesterday after Parliament decisively rejected her original plan to take Great Britain out of the European Union last week.
818141325	4	Associated Press:
818141325	5	Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party accused May of being in "deep denial" about her doomed deal.
818141325	6	"This really does feel a bit like 'Groundhog Day,'" he said, referring to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, in which a weatherman is fated to live out the same day over and over again.
818141325	7	Outlining what she plans to do after her EU divorce deal was rejected by Parliament last week, May said that she had heeded lawmakers' concerns over an insurance policy known as the "backstop" that is intended to guarantee there are no customs checks along the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.
818141325	8	May told the House of Commons that she would be "talking further this week to colleagues ... to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House.
818141325	9	"And I will then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU."
818141325	10	The bloc insists that it won't renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.
818141325	11	The problem with the Northern Ireland "backstop" is that May and the E.U.
818141325	12	kicked the can down the road for a permanent solution.
818141325	13	Plan "B" isn't much better:
818141325	14	The backstop proposes to keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU in order to avoid checks on the Irish border.
818141325	15	It is meant as a temporary measure that would last until a permanent solution is found.
818141325	16	But pro-Brexit U.K. lawmakers fear Britain could become trapped in it, indefinitely bound by EU trade rules.
818141325	17	Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz broke ranks with EU colleagues Monday by suggesting the problem could be solved by setting a five-year time limit on the backstop.
818141325	18	The idea got a cool reception.
818141325	19	Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that "putting a time-limit on an insurance mechanism, which is what the backstop is, effectively means that it's not a backstop at all."
818141325	20	The Labor Party is calling for a second referendum, which is political show and not a serious proposal – at least at this point.
818141325	21	A referendum couldn't be planned and executed by the March 29 deadline, and besides, there is no legal mechanism to withdraw Great Britain from Article 50 of the E.U.
818141325	22	charter – the legal basis they have invoked to withdraw from the E.U.
818141325	23	in the first place.
818141325	24	May is stuck and appears trapped between opposition E.U.
818141325	25	leaders, who are refusing to renegotiate the pact she agreed to in November, and members of her own party, who can't agree on how they should quit the E.U.
818141325	26	Looks as if May must go back to the drawing board.
820419869	1	No break from Brexit: RT takes a look at latest developments, as MPs told ‘no holiday for you’
820419869	3	As British MPs are told that their February break from parliament is to be cancelled in order to solve the chaos currently enveloping Britain, RT takes a look at the latest goings-on in the EU divorce saga.
820419869	4	On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.
820419869	5	Over two and a half years after that vote, the British people are no clearer as to how the country will leave the bloc it's been a member of since 1973.
820419869	6	So, where are we at with less than 60 days to go until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29?
820419869	7	Also on rt.com Brexit diagnosed in 10 common cognitive disorders
820419869	8	Theresa May and her government
820419869	9	The British prime minister won the backing of UK MPs in parliament on Tuesday after the ‘Brady’ amendment, backed by her government, was voted through, in what was seen as a major victory by many of her supporters.
820419869	10	The amendment instructed May to renegotiate her Brexit deal with the EU and secure the necessary changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
820419869	11	Without finding “alternative arrangements” that the EU will agree to, the PM will find it difficult to push through her deal at a second attempt in two weeks' time.
820419869	12	She's expected to travel to Brussels for talks in the next few days.
820419869	13	On Wednesday, Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that compromises would have to be made on the backstop by the EU otherwise it would lead to a no-deal – meaning the UK would not hand over any of the £39 billion divorce bill money.
820419869	14	Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, indicated on Thursday that Brexit could be delayed to secure a deal with the EU and claimed proposals to solve the Irish border issue will be devised over the coming days.
820419869	15	The EU
820419869	16	The bloc has remained united in their stance regarding opening up the EU Withdrawal agreement.
820419869	17	A variety of EU officials and representatives from member states have stated that they will not renegotiate the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed in November 2018 and will not contemplate removing the Irish backstop as it would threaten Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement.A spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk, issued a firm statement on Tuesday evening in the aftermath of May receiving the backing of UK parliament to renegotiate her deal, saying that the “Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.””
820419869	18	Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, insisted on Wednesday that the backstop must remain.
820419869	19	His Brexit Steering Group stated “…the withdrawal agreement is fair and cannot be re-negotiated.”
820419869	20	The Republic of Ireland's Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday that his country would not accept wishful thinking as an alternative to the backstop.
820419869	21	Coveney insisted: “We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty…”
820419869	22	Hardline Brexiteers
820419869	23	The European Research Group (ERG), seen as the highly influential Brexiteer faction of the Tory Party, supported May's government on a variety of amendments on Tuesday evening, including the Brady Brexit proposal.
820419869	24	However, the harmony between these hardline Brexiteers and May's cabinet has not lasted very long.
820419869	25	Former Brexit minister Steve Baker accused the PM of making a “stupid mistake” by excluding the ERG's favored civil servant, Crawford Falconer, to carry out renegotiations with the EU.
820419869	26	Olly Robbins, who currently leads the UK's civil service on Brexit negotiations, is seen as too pro-EU for the ERG's liking.
820419869	27	People's vote
820419869	28	MPs and activists campaigning for a second referendum have taken a severe hit to the momentum they seemed to have built over the last few months.
820419869	29	Their chances of securing a people's vote have been significantly reduced after MPs decided to vote against Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment that would have seen Brexit delayed past March 29.
820419869	30	Without an extension of Article 50, there cannot be enough time put aside to secure the necessary legislation for a second referendum.
820419869	31	Labour
820419869	32	Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party suffered a setback on Tuesday during votes on Brexit amendments.
820419869	33	They lost on the Cooper and Brady amenmendents as well as their own proposal to give MPs options to back Labour's Brexit plans and a second referendum.
820419869	34	Some party activists have called for Labour MPs who voted with May's government on key amendments on Tuesday to be deselected.
820419869	35	Corbyn met May on Wednesday for discussions on Brexit, in a bid to find a cross-party consensus that can garner the support of a majority of MPs.
820419869	36	He described talks as “a useful exchange of views” and asked the PM to consider a permanent customs union with the EU to break the impasse.

820791520	1	George III Lost America.
820791520	3	Theresa May Could Lose the United Kingdom Over Brexit.
820791520	5	Britain is locked in the most serious peacetime crisis in its modern history, the increasingly desperate attempt to secure the nation’s orderly departure from the European Union.
820791520	6	Brexit has shown the world a British parliament and a political class that resembles a ship of fools without a captain.
820791520	7	One veteran of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet said that voters are looking at parliament “with something rather near to contempt.”
820791520	8	We speak of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the Western world.
820791520	9	Since 1721 it has seen 74 prime ministers of highly varied competence and backgrounds but few if any as incapable of steering the country through perilous times as the current incumbent, Theresa May, who could end up being compared to George III because of the consequences of her ineptitude.
820791520	10	The ultimate test of a prime minister in a crisis is always the same—how well do they measure up to the moment?
820791520	11	The answer to that depends on a combination of skills.
820791520	12	Quite often they are skills that politicians do not find in themselves until they are called upon by destiny to prove them.
820791520	13	Different times need different abilities.
820791520	14	Sometimes a prime minister who at the time seems mediocre is later reassessed and seen to have been more consequential than anyone realized because he was overshadowed by a predecessor.
820791520	15	In British history there is a classic instance of this: In 1945 Winston Churchill was rudely and unexpectedly removed from office in a general election and replaced by the leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee.
820791520	16	Churchill, the country’s greatest ever war leader, was contemptuous of his successor whom he described as “a modest little man with a lot to be modest about.”
820791520	17	It turned out that Attlee (who was deputy prime minister during the war) was precisely what the nation needed, not only to get through years of austerity imposed by the near-bankruptcy created by the war effort, but as the parliamentary leader with the skills to re-engineer British society and provide its people with a comprehensive safety net including, notably, free universal health care for life.
820791520	18	So here were two men equally indispensable in their abilities, one to lead and the other to heal.
820791520	19	In each case their mastery reflected their character, Churchill who was able to project himself as the living embodiment of a great national narrative of obdurate resistance and victory and Attlee as the quiet but systematic architect of change.
820791520	20	And today Britain has Theresa May.
820791520	21	It is too generous to say that May has had trouble measuring up the to moment.
820791520	22	She has trouble explaining what the moment actually is—the utterance that will forever be her epitaph in the history of political discourse will be “Brexit means Brexit.”
820791520	23	Imagine Churchill saying “war means war.” OK, let’s be reasonable.
820791520	24	When it comes to oratory nobody can hold a candle to Churchill.
820791520	25	Every prime minister since Churchill has carefully avoided getting into that kind of contest.
820791520	26	But when the qualities of leadership are under scrutiny it’s important to understand that Churchill was as courageously decisive in private as he was in public.
820791520	27	There is a passage in Andrew Roberts’ sweeping new biography, Churchill, Walking With Destiny, describing a moment where the prime minister speaks ad lib and without leaving his own record of what was, literally, one of the statements that saved Britain.
820791520	28	He was speaking to men not as resolved as himself who needed to believe in him as an army needs to believe in its generals.
820791520	29	It came in the early summer of 1940 when Churchill, who had taken over only a week before, was resisting attempts to negotiate with Hitler.
820791520	30	He told his new cabinet: 
820791520	31	“I have thought carefully in these last days whether it was part of my duty to consider entering into negotiations with That Man.
820791520	32	But it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out.
820791520	33	The Germans would demand our fleet—that would be called ‘disarmament’—our naval bases and much else.
820791520	34	We should become a slave state… If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.”
820791520	35	No official minute was taken of that statement—Roberts quotes it as recorded later in the diary of a cabinet member.
820791520	36	What is new now is that Theresa May brings to the office a background like no other before her.
820791520	37	She is the first person to hold that office who is by both experience and instincts a bureaucrat.
820791520	38	Her rise to the Tory party leadership owed much to her success as a bureaucrat.
820791520	39	She ran a government department that was so large and so challenging to master that some prime ministers were known to have deliberately given it to rivals in order to destroy their careers: the Home Office, a Whitehall edifice that could perhaps be compared to a nightmare package embracing the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Homeland Security.
820791520	40	She was put there by David Cameron, a prime minister who was himself notoriously bored by administrative details and, as his decision to hold a national referendum on Brexit demonstrated, not too smart at judging outcomes.
820791520	41	May survived with a mixed record at the Home Office.
820791520	42	She acquired something of the reputation of a control freak, devoted to organizational charts and preferring to run the department through a small and tight-knit clique of loyal aides and Tory Party law-and-order zealots.
820791520	43	Churchill, famous for asking for opinions “on one half sheet of notepaper,” said that a camel is what you end up with if you ask a committee to design a horse.
820791520	44	May was fond of setting up committees and official inquiries to avoid taking action and produced many camels.
820791520	45	One of her former cabinet ministers despaired that “it’s a fantastic skill, her ability to do nothing.”
820791520	46	“ Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
820791520	47	The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
820791520	48	”
820791520	49	Later she managed to swat away responsibility for an ugly debacle during her watch.
820791520	50	West Indians who immigrated to Britain in the 1950s were threatened with mass deportation because they had no record of legally arriving—then it turned out that the Home Office itself had discarded the documentation.On the face of it her bureaucratic cast of mind should have been an asset when facing the complexities involved in negotiating Britain out of all the political, legal and commercial attachments to the European Union.
820791520	51	After all, the country was not facing a lethal existential threat.
820791520	52	This was a self-initiated unraveling of laws and treaties.
820791520	53	But the EU is the world’s largest assembly of bureaucrats, a characteristic often damned by the pro-Brexit campaign, as well as by more reasoned critics.
820791520	54	A negotiation of this complexity had never been attempted by anyone before.
820791520	55	It needed a team that combined a complete command of administrative detail, a shrewd sense of the national interest, an equally shrewd assessment of the opposing interests, and an ability to understand the difference between bottom-line economic interests and the EU’s loftier moral values as an alliance committed to protecting constitutional democracy in a continent with an unhappy history of autocracies.
820791520	56	This was a tough deal for anyone to successfully achieve.
820791520	57	But any leader who was able not only to pull it off but to sell it to their people—in the case of the UK to a people divided by a referendum margin as close as 52 to 48 percent—needed to have something else.
820791520	58	They had to be able to bring eloquence and vision to their argument.
820791520	59	Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
820791520	60	The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
820791520	61	The closest she has ever come to articulating the case for the Brexit deal she negotiated that set up a 21-month transition period for achieving a new free trade agreement with the EU (the deal that she is again stuck with trying to amend and resuscitate despite that fact that the EU has warned it will not renegotiate) was to say, repetitively, “It is in the national interest for everyone to get behind it.”
820791520	62	Basically when the narrow majority of Brits voted for Brexit they voted for something that didn’t actually exist.
820791520	63	There was not even the vaguest outline of the real impact that Brexit would have on British life.
820791520	64	Its proponents, even if they had any sense of the outcome (which is doubtful) weren’t interested in pesky details.
820791520	65	They were appealing to raw emotions, largely anti-immigrant xenophobia, not advancing a rational argument.
820791520	66	The Brexit deal that May presented to parliament went down in the biggest defeat any prime minister has suffered, 432 votes to 202.
820791520	67	All along she had been trying to reconcile elements that are not reconcilable: keeping the support of her party’s lunatic fringe that is undismayed by the prospect of a “no deal” exit that would bring extreme self-harm while also holding the loyalty of the center of the party—and doing this while satisfying the terms the EU is prepared to allow.
820791520	68	(“Allow” is the realistic term because Britain has always been a supplicant.)At the same time she survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote that leaves her in power while seriously wounded and without a new deal that is likely to fly.
820791520	69	Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, is similarly ineffectual and unready to meet the leadership tests of his time.
820791520	70	His party includes a rump of Brexiters and his cabinet is in thrall to fossilized Marxist ideas.
820791520	71	His rhetorical skills are, if anything, less evident than May’s.
820791520	72	Given two clueless party leaders it often seems that all the politicians are overcome by the kind of helpless rapture that sent Thelma and Louise driving blissfully over the cliff.
820791520	73	In 1940 Churchill’s freedom of action was greatly helped by the fact that he did not have to bow to any party’s dictates.
820791520	74	He was appointed prime minister without being leader of the Tory party—the leader remained his predecessor as prime minister, Neville Chamberlain.
820791520	75	Uniquely, Churchill led a coalition of the Tory, Labour and Liberal parties at a time when none of those parties would probably have accepted him as their party leader.
820791520	76	As a result of this freedom he was able to isolate and negate the influence of the appeasers who did not like the prospect of choking in their own blood.
820791520	77	He could and did appeal directly to the spirit of a parliament and a people who set aside partisan interests in favor of a higher purpose, victory that was by no means assured.
820791520	78	The irony now is that Brexiters represent only 15 percent of the 650 members of the House of Commons.
820791520	79	A large majority is opposed to Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal.
820791520	80	A prime minister not constrained by party loyalties could easily get support for a “soft” Brexit—meaning a measured transition from full membership to one that keeps the country in a permanent customs union without disruption.
820791520	81	Instead, by trying vainly to satisfy everyone May is satisfying nobody except people like the loony Little Englanders who say that such a deal would leave Britain as a “slave state.”
820791520	82	If they get their way May could well go down in history as the prime minister who lost the kingdom—the United Kingdom.
820791520	83	Scotland wants nothing to do with Brexit and if it is imposed on them the Scottish parliament will probably vote to end the Acts of Union of 1707 that created the United Kingdom in order to leave them free to join the EU.
820791520	84	The implications are wider than that.
820791520	85	Leaders in the European Union—including Germany’s Angela Merkel—are now fretting that the EU without Britain will be less able to clamp down on the kind of populist taste for autocrats that is afflicting Poland and Hungary.
820791520	86	George III went down in history as the king who lost America.
820791520	87	Nobody in particular was held culpable for losing the empire—that was an inevitability of history that imposed its own logic and timing.
820791520	88	If the United Kingdom becomes Little England (albeit including Wales and Northern Ireland) it will have reverted to the boundaries of the land it was in 40 A.D. when the Romans made a coherent colony out of a rabble of warring tribes.
820791520	89	And this fiasco will be owned by a parliament that allowed a deranged minority to win and a prime minister who was never remotely equal to the greatest challenge of her time.

821040551	3	If Britain leaves the European Union without a trade deal, and riots ensue, Queen Elizabeth will be evacuated from London, according to reports.
821040551	4	Many British people are reportedly worried that there won’t be a deal when the U.K.leaves the EU in less than 55 days and, as a result, have been busy stockpiling medication and food.
821040551	5	A new report has also emerged that the 92-year-old monarch has a contingency plan, underscoring the severity of the situation, The New York Times reported.
821040551	6	The Sunday Times additionally reported that evacuation plans for the royal family had long been in place.
821040551	7	A Cabinet Office staffer, who was not identified in the report, told the newspaper: “These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War, but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit.” Buckingham Palace declined to address evacuation plans on Sunday, with a spokeswoman saying, “We’re not commenting on that at all.”

821744708	3	Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, lashed out at the UK, saying he wonders what the "special place in hell" will be like for those who pushed for Brexit without coming up with a clear plan to deliver it.
821744708	4	Addressing reporters in Brussels, Tusk reiterated the EU’s position on the Withdrawal Agreement, stating that the Brexit deal agreed with Theresa May’s Tory government in November last year, was not open to renegotiation.
821744708	5	May arrives for talks with EU officials on Thursday in an attempt to formulate “alternative arrangements” on the contentious Irish backstop.
821744708	6	Tusk declared that he hoped the UK PM would come to the negotiating table with some realistic suggestions on the backstop.
821744708	7	On the prospect of a ‘no-deal’ scenario, Tusk insisted that Brussels is preparing for such a “fiasco,” before delivering some harsh words for UK government officials.
821744708	8	“I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to deliver it safely,” he said.

821744708	10	The EU Council president, flanked by Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar during his statement, claimed that people across Europe were hoping the UK would reverse its decision to leave the European Union.
821744708	11	He accepted that the prospect of the UK remaining in the EU was slim, given that both May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were “pro-Brexit.” He added: “Today, there is no political force, and no effective leadership, for remain.”
821744708	12	Tusk reaffirmed the bloc’s commitment to the Irish backstop, insisting that the EU “will not gamble with peace.”
821744708	13	A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May has responded to Tusk’s comments, stating that it was a question for him as to “...whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful.”
821744708	14	The Democratic Unionist Party’s Brexit spokesperson, Sammy Wilson MP, has unleashed a damning appraisal of Tusk following his Brussels statement, labeling him a “devilish, trident-wielding euro-maniac.”

822220578	3	Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Houses of Parliament in London on January 29, 2019.

822220578	5	London (CNSNews.com) – At the online Labour Party shop, you can still buy a spiffy T-shirt emblazoned with the picture of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, looking sober and determined.You can also purchase a Corbyn tote bag, mug, framed print – and the official Jeremy Corbyn pint glass, which can hold a liberal amount of beer.
822220578	6	However, these wares might not be flying off the virtual shelf so quickly these days, as a handful of polls indicate that Britain’s main opposition party is suffering as a result of its ambivalent stance towards a second vote on leaving the European Union.
822220578	7	The 69-year-old Corbyn, a veteran lawmaker on the party’s far left who beat the odds to become its leader in 2015, has long been popular among younger voters, who helped propel him to near victory in the 2017 general election.
822220578	8	Since then, he has refused to fully back calls for a second Brexit referendum, calling it merely one of the “other options” available, in case Britain’s planned withdrawal from the E.U.
822220578	10	next month goes badly.CCorbyn wrote a public letter to Prime Minister Theresa May this week, outlining what kind of agreement Labour would support with the E.U.
822220578	11	post-withdrawal.It included a customs union and a generally close relationship with the E.U., but was silent on the question of second referendum.
822220578	12	In a recent survey by Opinium, 22 percent of young Labour voter respondents indicated they could move away from the party on the grounds it hasn’t done enough to stop the planned exit.
822220578	13	A YouGov poll in December found similarly that support for Labour among 18 to 29-year-olds would drop from 60 to 33 percent if the party supported Brexit in any form.
822220578	14	British media outlets this week published parts of a leaked private report drawn up for a Labour-allied trade union, which reportedly described failure to oppose Brexit as more damaging to the party than its support for the Iraq war in 2003.
822220578	15	Meanwhile student leaders have warned that Labour is in danger of losing “millions” of voters.
822220578	16	A front-page advertisement in Corbyn’s local newspaper in London featured a call from more than 100 activists for a public vote.
822220578	17	Chris Stafford, an expert in British politics at the University of Nottingham, said this week Corbyn’s strategy has been to stay in the background while May’s Conservative Party – which has pro- and anti-E.U.
822220578	18	wings – has torn itself apart over Brexit.
822220578	19	But after waiting and biding his time, Stafford said, Corbyn is now under pressure to make his position clear.
822220578	20	“It is hard to criticize the government and say you would do it better while not offering a concrete alternative,” he said.
822220578	22	There has been public talk of a group of lawmakers breaking away from Labour, although Stafford said he doubted a new party would attract that many voters.“When it comes to election day most people stick with one of the bigger parties because they don’t want to ‘waste’ their vote on a different [smaller] one,” he said.
822220578	23	Stafford said while polls suggest Labour is losing support, Corbyn could regain popularity if he takes a stance that makes his party distinct from the Conservatives.
822220578	24	May has pledged not to run again for prime minister.
822220578	25	Stafford said that, while much will depend on who the Tories choose as their next leader, the complete disarray within the Conservative Party will help Corbyn look like a better option.
822220578	26	Call for U.S.-style primaries
822220578	27	This week, a prominent Labour activist called for American-style primaries to be introduced when it came to selecting candidates for parliament.
822220578	28	Aaron Bastani, a writer with links to Corbyn, tweeted that if people thought newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) embodied excellent politics it was important to remember she got into office through a primary.
822220578	29	“We need the best leaders in parliament,” he tweeted.
822220578	30	“Primaries, along with mandatory reselection, is how.”
822220578	31	Currently, candidates in both the Labour and Conservative parties are selected through local party organizations, often with input from the party’s national office.
822220578	32	In 2009, in what was billed as a first, a physician named Sarah Wollaston was selected as a Conservative Party candidate through an open primary held through the mail.
822220578	33	She won, and now sits in the House of Commons representing Totnes in southwest England.
822220578	34	Wollaston said Thursday that the experiment allowed local voters to choose from a wide range of candidates, both experienced politicians and newcomers.
822220578	35	Non party members were allowed to participate as well, in a constituency that has a solid tradition of electing Conservatives.
822220578	36	“In a so called safe seat, open primaries give voters the chance to select a candidate who, if subsequently elected, would at least be nearer their own political views,” she said.
822220578	37	“But the postal method is expensive and I think this has made it difficult to sustain.”
822295249	1	Norway’s govt proposes legislation to secure rights of citizens in case of no-deal Brexit
822295249	3	Norway proposed legislation on Friday to secure the rights of Norwegians living in Britain and of Britons living in Norway in case of a no-deal Brexit, the Justice Ministry in Oslo said.
822295249	4	While Britain and EU-outsider Norway agreed last year to apply the principles of a Brexit agreement in their bilateral relationship, the new legislation would also cover a no-deal scenario.
822295249	5	“We hope Britain will have an orderly exit from the EU.
822295249	6	We must however be prepared for Britain choosing to leave the EU without a deal,” said Justice Minister Tor Mikkel Wara.
822295249	7	If approved, the legislation would delegate power from the non-EU nation’s parliament to the government, allowing it to protect citizens’ rights, Reuters said.
822942601	1	Britain’s Gavin Williamson places Russia & China on notice, I'm not joking
822942601	3	UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is itching for conflict with Russia and China.
822942601	4	He’s not mad.
822942601	5	Not even slightly.
822942601	6	But he is stupid.
822942601	7	Very.
822942601	8	Unlike former fireplace salesman Gavin Williamson, I am no military expert.
822942601	9	But then you do not need to be one to understand that while Britain going to war with Russia and China might work as a video game, the real thing would be an exceedingly bad idea.
822942601	10	So why then in a speech delivered to the Royal United Services Institute in London, did Mr Williamson’s argument on the feasibility of the real thing elicit applause rather than the shrieks of horror and demands he be sacked forthwith it should have?
822942601	11	This is a serious question, by the way.
822942601	12	It is one that cuts through British establishment verbiage to reveal a country ruled not by the sober and doughty political heavyweights of years gone by, but by foaming fanatics in expensive suits.
822942601	13	Also on rt.com We must be ready to use ‘hard power’ against Moscow and Beijing – UK defense chief
822942601	14	Placing to one side for a moment the insanity of the very concept of Britain deploying hard power against Russia and/or China, the prospect of fighting a war against two designated enemies at the same time is a recipe for disaster.
822942601	15	Not satisfied with that, though, Mr Williamson is actually contemplating a conflict with three different enemies at the same time – i.e.
822942601	16	against Russia, China, and the millions of people in Britain his government is currently waging war against under the rubric of austerity.
822942601	17	“Today, Russia is resurgent," Mr Williamson said, “rebuilding its military arsenal and seeking to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union, like Georgia and Ukraine, back into its orbit.”
822942601	18	For Mr Williamson and his ilk a resurgent Russia is a bad thing.
822942601	19	Much better in their eyes if Russia, after the Soviet era in the 1990s, had remained on its knees as a free market desert; its state institutions in a state of near collapse and tens of millions of its citizens in the grip of immiseration.
822942601	20	Yes, because in that scenario Western ideologues like him would have had free rein to rampage around the world as they saw fit, setting fire to country after country on the perverse grounds of ‘saving them’ for democracy.
822942601	21	Read more
822942601	22	As it is, he and his still managed to squeeze in a considerable amount of carnage and chaos in the years it did take Russia to recover.
822942601	23	The indictment reads as follows: Yugoslavia destroyed; Afghanistan turned upside down; Iraq pushed into the abyss; Libya sent to hell.
822942601	24	By the time they turned their attention to Syria, intent on exploiting an Arab Spring that NATO in Libya transformed into an Arab Winter, Russia had recovered and was able to intervene.
822942601	25	It did so in concert with the Syrian Arab Army, Iran and Hezbollah to save the day – much to the evident chagrin of those who, like Gavin Williamson, prefer to see countries in ashes rather than independent of Western hegemony.
822942601	26	As to the facile nonsense about Russia trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit, both countries happen to share a border with Russia and both countries, in recent years, have been used by the UK and its allies as cat’s paws with the eastward expansion of NATO in mind.
822942601	27	It gets worse though: “The Alliance must develop its ability to handle the kind of provocations that Russia is throwing at us.
822942601	28	Such action from Russia must come at a cost.”
822942601	29	“Provocations,” the man said.
822942601	30	Since British troops have been taking part in exercises on Russia’s doorstep, not the other way round, one wonders if Gavin Williamson wrote this speech while inebriated.
822942601	31	It is Russia that has been on the receiving end of repeated provocations from NATO member states such as the UK in recent times, and it is Russia that has been forced to respond to protect its own security and that of its people where necessary.
822942601	32	Furthermore, not only in Russia but everywhere, including the UK, people understand that when you have political leaders intoxicated by their own national myths and propaganda to such an extent as Britain’s Defence Secretary, danger ensues.
822942601	33	Read more
822942601	34	The most enduring of those national myths where London is concerned is that the British Empire was a force for good rather than a vast criminal enterprise, that Britain and America won the Second World War together alone, that Iraq had WMDs, and that international law and international brigandage really are one and the same thing.
822942601	35	Perhaps the most preposterous section of the speech came when Mr Williamson tried to fashion a connection between Brexit and Britain’s military strength: “Brexit has brought us to a moment.
822942601	36	A great moment in our history.
822942601	37	A moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass.”
822942601	38	Reading this, you can almost hear Churchill turning in his grave.
822942601	39	Britain’s wartime prime minister had such as Gavin Williamson in mind when he famously said, “He has all the virtues I dislike, and none of the vices I admire.”
822942601	40	Mr Williamson obviously misread the memo talking up not the opportunity for increased conflict with China after Brexit but trade.
822942601	41	This was not a speech it was a linguistic car crash, one that will forever command an honoured place in compendiums of the worst political speeches ever made.
822942601	42	As for Gavin Williamson, just as no responsible parent would ever dream of putting an 10-year old behind the wheel of car to drive unsupervised, no responsible British government would ever appoint a man like him as its Defence Secretary.
822942601	43	In years past, he would have struggled to find employment polishing the brass plate outside the building.

824256050	1	Ireland and the Border
824256050	3	Ireland and the Border
824256050	4	Ireland has been a trouble spot since the invasion of the island by the English king Henry II in 1171, whether to prevent a rival, Strongbow, from controlling the area, or to overcome the damaging opprobrium resulting from the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 29, 1170, by four of his knights.
824256050	5	Declaring that Ireland was a part of his empire, Henry II changed the course of Irish history as resident Normans in the area pledged their loyalty to the British crown.
824256050	6	Almost a thousand years later, the borders of Ireland remain a difficult political problem, and indeed may have dominated the debate over the last few years over the issue of Brexit.
824256050	7	Economic and political relationship between the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, has been a central factor in the negotiation process of the UK and EU over Brexit.
824256050	8	Thus, the border issue is not simply bilateral, it is also an EU issue.
824256050	9	The problem is compounded by the fact that the Brexit issue evokes historical memories as well as having political as well as economic implications.
824256050	10	After Henry II, inhabitants lost territory to new arrivals from England, who formulated the laws.
824256050	11	The crucial problem arose with Henry VIII and his decision to leave the Catholic Church and have the country adopt Protestantism, to which many Irish were opposed in their desire to remain Protestant as well as speak their own language, Gaelic.
824256050	12	Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland to reestablish control over Ireland, massacring over 2,000 of the population in the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, while Ulster, a Protestant bastion, remained loyal to England, as it still is.
824256050	13	Cromwell remains a villain for many Irish.
824256050	14	More troubles ensued during following centuries.
824256050	15	During the great famine 1845-49, Ireland lost more than 1.5 million victims.
824256050	16	By 1900 the country had only half the number of inhabitants it had in 1830.
824256050	17	On January 1, 1801 the Act of Union united the two areas, previously linked by personal union, into a single kingdom, the United Kingdom.
824256050	18	The Chief Secretary, the key administrator in governing Ireland, ruled on behalf of London.
824256050	19	However, the struggle for Irish emancipation starting in the 19thcentury continued.
824256050	20	After the failed Easter Rising against British rule in April 1916, guerrilla war between the IRA and Britain occurred, 1919-1921.
824256050	21	It ended in May 1921 with the partitioning of the country, ending British rule in most of Ireland.
824256050	22	The Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion in December 1922 while Northern Ireland, NI, remained in the UK.
824256050	23	Finally, on April 18, 1949 the Republic of Ireland was established, an independent republic, headed by a president.
824256050	24	However, hostilities between the IRA and the government continued in Ulster, virtually 30 years of civil war, including the Bloody Sunday incident on January 30, 1972 when 28 unarmed civilians were killed by British troops during a protest March in Derry (Londonderry).
824256050	25	Hostilities lasted until April 10, 1998, Good Friday, which began the peace process.
824256050	26	Good Friday was concerned with creating an infrastructure of cooperation between north and south, between the Irish government and the newly created power sharing Irish Assembly, in Northern Ireland.
824256050	27	It also implied the normalization of relations between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and the ROI.
824256050	28	The normalization would mean the opening of the border which had previously been manned by British soldiers.
824256050	29	As a result, since both countries are still in the EU, there are no checks on goods or people moving between Northern Ireland and the ROI.
824256050	30	The open border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process as well as of economic cross-border cooperation.
824256050	31	All political sides in the Brexit negotiations agree there should not be a “hard” border, checks on persons, goods, or infrastructure, dividing NI from the ROI whatever the outcome of final negotiations.
824256050	32	Therefore, keeping the border open and abiding by the Good Friday Agreement is critical.
824256050	33	As a result, Brexit negotiators devised the so-called “backstop,” a political invention, a fallback position, to keep the border open as much as possible between the ROI and NI, even if no comprehensive trade deal can be reached between UK and EU.
824256050	34	NI is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another EU country, the ROI.
824256050	35	By backstop, the whole of UK, according to Prime Minister Theresa May, would enter in a single customs territory with EU, no tariffs on trade in goods between UK and EU, though NI would be aligned to other rules of the single market.
824256050	36	Two problems are related to this.
824256050	37	One is that May does not favor a permanent customs deal lest it prevent British free trade deals with other countries.
824256050	38	The other is that her proposals have twice been defeated in the House of Commons, on January 15, 2019 by 432-202, and on February 14, 2019 by 303-258.
824256050	39	In the latter vote, her own Conservative party, 5 voted against her, and 67 others abstained.
824256050	40	The essential features of the EU, single market and customs union, allow people, goods, and services to enter other EU countries without inspection.
824256050	41	The basic problem is that if Britain leaves the EU it will probably lead to delays and checks in this policy.
824256050	42	The reality would be that the ROI and NI would be in different customs and regulatory regimes, and British goods would be checked at the border.
824256050	43	The backstop, a last resort, is intended to prevent full border controls on goods crossing between ROI and NI.
824256050	44	For Britain one problem is that it can only end the backstop arrangement with EU agreement.
824256050	45	The issue is both economic and political.
824256050	46	The fear is that barriers between North and South Ireland might revive the old animosity, the Troubles, the 30-year conflict over NI status as part of the UK.Military controls of the 500-kilometer border were only removed with the Good Friday agreement which provided for more collaboration and free movement between the two entities..
824256050	47	Irish and British politics enter into the picture.
824256050	48	For 10 years in NI the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein worked together in a government coalition.
824256050	49	Power sharing in NI ended in on January 9, 2017 because of differences between the major parties over the issue of green energy.
824256050	50	It led to the general election of June 8, 2017 which resulted in a hung parliament.
824256050	51	The Conservatives won 42,4% of the vote and gained 318 of the 50 seats, less than a majority; the Labour Party got 40.0% of the vote and 262 seats.
824256050	52	Of the Irish parties.
824256050	53	DUP got 10 and Sinn Fein 7.
824256050	54	The UK government therefore relies on the DUP for a majority vote in the House of Commons, which it has twice lost.
824256050	55	The Republic of Ireland, like NI, would suffer from a hard border.
824256050	56	At the same time, it is benefitting from London-based groups banking institutions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays, asset management, and insurance companies, who want to retain access to EU markets.
824256050	57	ROI will also benefit from pharmaceutical and legal firms which are moving business to Dublin.
824256050	58	The dilemma of Brexit negotiations continues, especially since PM May does not have full support from her Conservative party.
824256050	59	The EU may be less inclined to make compromise concessions in view of May’s lack of control of her party.
824256050	60	A major problem is that the scheduled departure of UK from the EU on March 29 may have to be delayed because of the difficulties in agreeing on future trade and economic relations.
824256050	61	The immediate issue is to identity “backstop” with full clarity, or find a suitable alternative, to prevent a hard border.
824350729	1	‘Go join Farage’s new party’: Tory minister lashes out at Rees-Mogg’s ‘treacherous’ Brexiteers
824350729	3	A Tory cabinet minister has launched a scathing attack on hardline Brexiteer faction, the ERG, after claiming they “drank champagne to celebrate” PM May’s deal being defeated – telling them to defect to Nigel Farage’s new party.
824350729	4	In an interview for The House magazine, business minister Richard Harrington accused the European Research Group, headed by prominent backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg of “treachery,” claiming that in his “view they’re not Conservatives.”
824350729	5	Also on rt.com May mocked after claiming 'I wanted Brexit sorted by Christmas,' as SNP’s Blackford calls her a liar
824350729	6	Harrington, who voted ‘remain’ in the 2016 EU referendum, and has himself intimated that he would be willing to quit May’s cabinet if no-deal Brexit became government policy urged ERG members to join a party that was more in line with their vision for the UK.
824350729	7	“I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called ‘Brexit’ and if I were them I’d be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative Party does,” Harrington suggested.
824350729	8	The government minister was giving his views in the aftermath of Theresa May losing a vote (303-258) on her Brexit deal, that sought to give her more time to negotiate with the EU, changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
824350729	9	The ERG abstained on the vote, with its deputy chairman, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister claiming they couldn’t back something that took “no-deal off the table.”
824350729	10	May’s defeat last night, albeit on a vote that was legally non-binding, has triggered a Tory civil war with cracks appearing within the PM’s cabinet, specifically on the issue of taking the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal – off the table.
824350729	11	Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Britain is prepared to leave the bloc without a divorce deal, insisting the only way to avoid such a scenario is for the UK parliament to vote for May’s Brexit agreement.
824350729	12	No.
824350729	13	We won’t.
824350729	14	We are not leaving without a deal.
824350729	15	If you want to leave, you’d better agree one.

824350729	18	However, foreign office and international development minister, Alistair Burt, has lambasted such suggestions, taking to social media to claim: “We are not leaving without a deal,” in a reply to former Brexit Secretary David Davis.
824350729	19	The PM’s defeat on Thursday night was her 11th on Brexit in 14 months.
824350729	20	It further adds to the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and arguably undermines her pledge to EU leaders that she would be able to gain a good majority of MPs to support her deal.

824658990	3	A group of Labour MPs have announced that they are quitting the party and will sit as Independent MPs in the house of commons, hitting out at leader Jeremy Corbyn for presiding over an "institutionally anti-Semitic" party.
824658990	4	The seven Labour MPs quitting the party to become 'The Independent Group', are Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey.
824658990	5	Announcing their resignations in Westminster, Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree took to the stage first, to claim that she could not stay in the party any more because it had become "institutionally anti-Semitic."
824658990	6	Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, a prominent 'People's Vote' advocate appealed to all MPs, not just Labour, to join their group, as the current parties are part of the problem, not the solution.
824658990	7	He argued that “It is time we dumped this country’s old fashioned politics.” Umunna claimed the UK needed a political party “fit for the hear and now” and the “first step in leaving the tribal politics behind."

824658990	9	Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, insisted that it had not been an easy decision to make but that he believed that the Labour Party had been hijacked by the “machine politics of the hard left."
824658990	10	Labour has been dogged by accusations of acting too slowly in investigating claims of anti-Semitism within the party.
824658990	11	The issue became such a toxic issue for the party that it even led to veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge allegedly calling Corbyn an “anti-Semite" in the house of commons.
824658990	12	Labour’s governing body, finally agreed in September to adopt the IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism with all 11 examples following highly charged debate over its pitfalls, with accusations that free speech in relation to Palestine could be curtailed.
824658990	13	Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, revealed that it had been a very painful decision to resign her membership but suggested the current Labour party were guilty of patronizing the electorate.
824658990	15	Today, seven MPs have left Labour and formed a new, Independent Group.

824658990	18	Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, in perhaps a dig at Corbyn'sforeign policyy, says the new independent group “does not think every problem in the world has been created by the west.”
824658990	19	Ann Coffey, MP for Stockport, says the Labour party is no longer a broad church.
824658990	20	“The current leadership has been very successful at changing the party beyond recognition,” she says.
824658990	21	“Loyalty cannot be an end in itself.”
824658990	22	Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South, says he is sickened by anti-Semitism in the party and angry that the Labour leadership is facilitating Brexit.

824658990	26	Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has reacted to the news by saying he is saddened by the decision of MPs to leave the party.
824658990	27	In a statement Corbyn said: "I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945."

824684605	1	Seven U.K. Labour Lawmakers Quit Over Jeremy Corbyn's Handling of Brexit and Anti-Semitism
824684605	3	LONDON—Britain’s nervous breakdown in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union has mostly been felt by Theresa May and lawmakers in her Conservative party, who have been at each other’s throats for two years as they stumble towards Brexit.
824684605	4	But the main opposition party—Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour—has also been coming apart at the seams.
824684605	5	That became even clearer Monday when seven of its lawmakers, unable to back their left-wing leader on Brexit or the way he’s dealt with anti-Semitism in the party, decided to quit.
824684605	6	Some of the reasons given by the seven members of parliament [MPs] at their dramatic press conference were similar to the bitter arguments which have seen Conservative party politicians angrily fighting amongst themselves.
824684605	7	Namely, a complete disagreement with their leader on how to go forward with the Brexit referendum result.
824684605	8	One of the seven, Chris Leslie, accused Corbyn of a “betrayal” on Europe by helping to enable May's vision of Brexit and refusing to back a second referendum on the issue.
824684605	9	Although he claims he voted to stay in the EU, Corbyn has been a long-time critic of the bloc and many in his party suspect he’s quite happy to see Britain leave.
824684605	10	But it’s the problems unique to Labour that appear to have made the seven most angry and led to the biggest split in the party since the early 1980s.
824684605	11	Luciana Berger, a Jewish MP who’s been a frequent target of anti-Semites in the party, said that she'd come to the “sickening conclusion” that the party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic.”
824684605	12	The Labour party has been plagued by anti-Semitism incidents since Corbyn became leader with the backing of tens of thousands of new left-wing members.
824684605	13	A string of incidents last year saw a joint editorial published by the country’s three most prominent Jewish newspapers claiming that a government led by him would pose an “existential threat” to Jews living in Britain.
824684605	14	Leslie agreed with Berger, saying that Labour been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left,” while another of the seven, Mike Gapes, declared angrily: “I am sickened that Labour is now perceived by many as a racist, anti-Semitic party.”
824684605	15	Berger said she’d become "embarrassed and ashamed" to stay in the party, and added that she felt like she was “leaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation.
824684605	16	I look forward to a future serving with colleagues who respect each other.”
824684605	17	How many of her former colleagues might join her is unclear.
824684605	18	Several MPs who’ve been severely critical of Corbyn since he became leader have issued statements saying that they still think trying to change the party from within is the best way forward, but that Corbyn has to see Monday’s resignations as the final warning.
824684605	19	The seven also made a clear appeal to members of other parties who are uncomfortable with their leaders to join them, with some Conservatives appearing to be open to the idea.
824684605	20	The group, and whoever else joins it, will now sit in House of Commons as a loose group of independent members of parliament rather than as a new party.
824684605	21	The seven rejected comparisons with the Social Democratic Party [SDP] which broke away from the Labour Party in the early 1980s but eventually merged with the Liberal Party.
824684605	22	The SDP is often reviled in Labour history for splitting left-wing voters and helping Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative dominate British politics for a decade.
824684605	23	Another one of the seven, one-time Labour leadership contender Chuka Umunna, declared at the press conference: "Politics is broken.
824684605	24	It doesn't have to be this way.
824684605	25	Let's change it.”
824684605	26	It’s obvious to anyone with a passing interest in British politics that the current system is broken.
824684605	27	Whether this breakaway can fix it, or indeed if anything can, is far from clear.
828866387	1	Brexit in 23 days: EU says still 'no solution'
828866387	3	(DW.COM) – Just over three weeks before the UK walks out of the European Union, there has been no breakthrough to amend Britain’s divorce deal.
828866387	4	The deadlock between the EU and Britain is centered on the so-called Irish backstop.
828866387	5	The European Union said Wednesday there has been no progress in the latest talks with Britain, just days before the UK lawmakers are set for a second vote to avoid a hard Brexit.
828866387	6	EU diplomats led by negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterparts met in Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to amend their divorce deal before Britain’s scheduled exit on March 29.
828866387	7	Read more: Brexit: Why is the Irish backstop so controversial?
828866387	8	“Michel Barnier has informed…that while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere, discussions have been difficult,” said Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive.
828866387	9	“No solution has been identified at this point that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will not be reopened,” Schinas said.
829267754	1	Theresa May Doesn’t Have the Votes
829267754	3	Theresa May still does not appear to have the votes for her deal.
829267754	4	What then?
829267754	5	Extend and PretendEurointelligence says You Really Should Not Take EU’s Willingness to Extend for Granted.
829267754	6	One of the dangers of the Brexit debate is that everybody is making hidden assumptions about what others will do.
829267754	7	One of these assumptions is that the EU would only be too happy to extend the Brexit deadline.
829267754	8	The EU would, of course, extend to give time for ratification of a deal or even to make way for a cross-party deal.
829267754	9	But Theresa May would have to make clear pretty quickly that this is what she wants to do after the meaningful vote goes against her for a second time – which may well happen.
829267754	10	However, the idea that the EU is willing to accept a long extension, or a semi-permanent one, is fanciful for a number of reasons.
829267754	11	The most important relates to power politics within the EU.
829267754	12	The EPP has to be mindful of the impact a long delay would have on the balance of power, especially if it were to expel Viktor Orban.
829267754	13	If the UK were forced to hold European elections in May it would not send a single delegate to the EPP, which means that the EPP’s relative position in the parliament would weaken further.
829267754	14	A long delay would almost certain lead to an outcry among Brexit supporters, and could trigger a groundswell of support for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party.
829267754	15	It appears to us that opposition to May’s deal among pro-Brexit MPs is hardening again – partly based on those delusions.
829267754	16	Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details) If the meaningful vote is negative – as it may well be – we assume that May would at this point try to reach a cross-party agreement to open up the discussion on the future relationship, by giving the House of Commons the right to pass instructions to the government for the post-Brexit negotiations.
829267754	17	At that point, a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	18	In Brussels, meanwhile, the UK-EU talks are becoming more concrete.
829267754	19	Tony Connelly writes in RTE that the two sides were working on three separate strands: one on the guarantee of the backstop’s temporary nature; a second on the technological solutions that might replace the backstop; and a third on how to change the political declaration.
829267754	20	Negotiations are now in the hot phase – with an agreement due probably on Monday.
829267754	21	We doubt that the two sides would want to give the British press much time to take this deal apart.
829267754	22	Soft Brexit?
829267754	23	Eurointelligence assumes a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
829267754	24	But I am not certain what they means by a soft Brexit.
829267754	25	Regardless, unless there is some sort of binding guarantee by the EU as a backstop replacement, one can hardly be certain of anything.
829267754	26	Deal or No Deal?​
829267754	27	Christopher Howarth, a senior research analyst for the House of Commons, says Deal or No deal, Brexit Cannot be Stopped.
829267754	28	Howarth concludes “If the Government brings back the same deal without an exit to the backstop, it will be defeated.
829267754	29	If it is defeated, there will be no second referendum or prolonged stay in the EU.
829267754	30	The UK will leave.
829267754	31	In short, don’t panic: if MPs hold their nerve, we are leaving the EU on 29th March without a permanent backstop.”
829267754	32	In short, Howarth either believes the EU will budge or there will be a no-deal Brexit.
829267754	33	I am not as confident as Howarth but I believe his take is more likely than that of Eurointelligence.
829267754	34	Crunching the Numbers – Guardian
829267754	35	The Guardian did the math as it stands today [March 5 as reported by Eurointelligence] : May needs an additional 110 votes to get the deal through – from a pool of 115 Tory MPs and 40 Labour MPs in leave-voting seats.
829267754	36	There are 7 pro-Remain Tory MPs who said they will vote against the deal without a referendum.
829267754	37	This leaves a total of 148 MPs.
829267754	38	If 10-20 Tory Brexiteers reject the deal, she will need to pick up some 20-30 or so Labour MPs to get it through.
829267754	39	And it seems that the best way to get those Labour MPs lined up would be an open vote on the future relationship, including the option a customs union.
829267754	40	There is no chance of the UK parliament aligning behind any option for so long as Brexit itself has not happened.
829267754	41	But, once it has, the probability of agreement is large simply because the more extreme Brexit options – leave without a deal or re-run the referendum – will have been eliminated.
829267754	42	This is why a two-stage ratification is much more likely to succeed than a once-and-for-all vote.
829267754	43	Convoluted Position
829267754	44	The Eurointelligence position seems more than a bit convoluted.

829267754	46	Supposedly, once Brexit happens, leave without a deal will be off the table.
829267754	47	Not Enough Votes
829267754	48	Bloomberg’s Brexit Bulletin concludes Not Enough Votes
829267754	49	Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief whip told the Cabinet on Tuesday he’s not confident he has the numbers to get her exit accord approved next week, and predicted that a defeat would be followed by Parliament forcing the U.K. to maintain closer ties with the European Union.
829267754	50	Julian Smith, the man with the impossible job of manufacturing majorities for May’s Brexit policy, told ministers that the vote will be tight and he doesn’t know which way it’s going to go, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
829267754	51	Meanwhile, the signals from the Labour camp don’t look good for May.
829267754	52	Labour officials are sounding increasingly upbeat that they will be able to contain the potential voting rebellion in their ranks.
829267754	53	Speaking privately, three officials said they’re confident fewer than 10 Labour lawmakers would vote with May, even though whips have as many as 30 members of Parliament on their list of potential rebels.
829267754	54	The less likely the deal is to pass, the less inclined wavering lawmakers might be to risk their careers to back it.
829267754	55	May’s latest efforts to get Labour MPs on board are falling flat.
829267754	56	Cash handouts for pro-Brexit regions were widely criticized earlier this week and the government’s long-awaited announcement on protecting workers’ rights after Brexit — also aimed at giving Labour MPs an excuse to back the agreement — have been slammed as insufficient.
829267754	57	Meaningful Vote
829267754	58	The first two Bloomberg paragraphs above sound like hogwash and fearmongering by Theresa May.
829267754	59	The second two paragraphs are more realistic.
829267754	60	Unless the EU agrees to modify the backstop in a meaningful way the vote will go down.
829267754	61	If it’s close, then expect May to keep submitting it to vote.
829267754	62	That’s way I don’t have overriding confidence in the opinion of Howarth.
829267754	63	If a vote fails a second time May will put forth an amendment to take no-deal off the Table.
829267754	64	The problem for May and the UK parliament is such a vote is not legally binding.
829267754	65	The UK leaves on March 29 unless the UK parliament passes something the EU agree with.
829267754	66	That’s why I have no confidence in the opinion of Eurointelligence.
829267754	67	Curiously, Eurointelligence says don’t take for granted the EU will extend, yet it fully expects an extension.
829267754	68	I expect one too, but lasting no longer than June.
829267754	69	Otherwise, the UK will be represented in the EU parliament and will make a mess of things.
829267754	70	Malthouse Compromise
829267754	71	I keep returning to the Malthouse Compromise.
829267754	72	It is the one solution that seems to be a reasonable alternative for everyone but the hard remainers.
829267754	73	Under the Malthouse Compromise, Brexit happens and the backstop stays in place for a maximum of two years.
829267754	74	Then and only then is there a hard Brexit, assuming the UK and EU cannot come up with a backstop replacement.
829267754	75	The EU labels this a unicorn.
829267754	76	If the Brexiteers repeatedly hold their ground, I expect something like the Malthouse compromise to win.
829267754	77	Theresa May may resign first, or not.
829267754	78	But if so, Tories are back in the lead in polls, and there is the possibility they can pick a suitable candidate that could get a majority right now.

829815104	1	Brussels Shows Its Fear
829815104	3	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been under fire from the European Union for years for his opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open immigration policy.
829815104	4	A policy which she herself has had to pull back on.
829815104	5	And no matter how far Merkel has changed her stance and acceded to the reality of the damage her policy has created, Orban is still guilty of the sin of non-compliance.
829815104	6	Actually, he’s guilty of a whole lot more than that.
829815104	7	Because Orban has not only stepped on the third-rail of European politics he’s stomped up and down while taking a massive dump on it.
829815104	8	That third-rail, of course, is naming names.
829815104	9	Naming the very person who controls so much of EU policy through his co-opting large swaths of the European parliament.That person, of course, is George Soros.
829815104	10	Now there is a push, ahead of May’s European Parliamentary elections, to kick Orban’s dominant Fidesz party out of the European People’s Party (EPP), a nominal center-right coalition and the largest single party within the EU parliament.

829815104	12	And with each victory over Soros Orban grows even bolder.
829815104	13	After a successful re-election campaign predicated on the slogan, “Don’t Let Soros Win,” Orban has banned Soros’ major NGO, Open Society Foundation, as well as forced out his Central European University.
829815104	14	But his biggest sin was equating outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude “When things get tough you have to lie” Juncker with Soros’ attempts to weaken Hungary’s border.
829815104	15	His reward for this, and building a border fence which thwarts Soros and Merkel’s tactic of tying immigrants in the host country in legal limbo for years by being inset from Hungary’s actual border, has been an Article 7 procedure opened up against Hungary for not abiding by the EU’s position on human rights.
829815104	16	Poland is in similar hot water with Merkel but thanks to one of the few reasonable things within the EU’s framework, each country can use the other to veto the actual censuring and concomitant removal of voting rights within the Union that comes with the full application of Article 7.
829815104	17	But this article isn’t really about Orban’s latest troubles with the faux democrats within the EU parliament.
829815104	18	It’s about how scared those people are of the rise in Euroskeptics like Orban across the continent ahead of May’s elections.
829815104	19	Orban’s potential expulsion from the EPP is just another symptom of this fear.
829815104	20	Recently, France’s Marine Le Pen, found out that the trial against her for tweeting out images of ISIS beheadings back in 2015, will go forward with the potential of landing her in jail for three years.
829815104	21	This is not much different than the kidnapping charge Sicilian prosecutors tried to bring against Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of Lega and all-around bad boy Matteo Salvini in Italy.
829815104	22	This was a lame attempt to split Italy’s Euroskeptic coalition and keep it focused on internal trivialities versus mounting a real challenge in May’s elections.
829815104	23	The same is true now for Le Pen.
829815104	24	Her National Rally party is polling within the margin of error of President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche with a real chance to send a plurality of French Euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels in a couple of months.
829815104	25	Merkel is struggling with the same thing.
829815104	26	And even though support for Alternative for Germany (AfD) has waned in recent polling, down to just 13%, don’t underestimate the voters’ desire to send a strong message to Brussels by voting in stronger numbers for the new or alternative parties rather than how they would vote for them at home.
829815104	27	We’ve seen this in the past with UKIP who shocked everyone in the last European elections in 2014 with the size of the vote for them.
829815104	28	It never translated into domestic momentum as typical prisoner’s dilemma concerns are more prevalent in Britain’s majoritarian voting system.
829815104	29	But for the EU parliament where the two-party system doesn’t hold sway and the direct benefits are harder to make a case to voters for, it’s much more likely voters will loosen up a little and throw their support for a smaller, less established party.
829815104	30	And that, along with some serious miscalculations about Brexit which I’ll get to in a minute, has the power elite in European political circles very scared.
829815104	31	So scared that they are willing to devote serious resources in Quixotic endeavors of dubious value.
829815104	32	Expelling Orban from the EPP will only give him more strength.
829815104	33	It will only give Euroskeptics more ammunition.
829815104	34	Orban, like Salvini, revels in being the outsider.
829815104	35	He’ll use it to rally others across Eastern Europe and pull a few more seats into that orbit.
829815104	36	According to the latest polling, which you can find an up-to-date tally of here, Euroskeptic parties will take between 215 and 225 seats out of the 705 up for grabs, assuming Britain actually leaves and doesn’t stand for MEP elections, which at this point doesn’t look likely.

829815104	38	If reports are true that Prime Minister Theresa May cut a deal with Merkel in July of last year on the withdrawal agreement.
829815104	39	And if that agreement was structured so as to ease the way for the U.K. to rejoin the EU later are true, then there is no way Mrs. May will be able to forestall Brexit on WTO terms at this point, even if it takes another 90 days to do so.
829815104	40	A report from the Bruges Group, since taken down, had the details (see link above).
829815104	41	And we’ll know if this is the case if suddenly Theresa May agrees to step aside as Prime Minister just after March 29th whether or not Britain leaves.
829815104	42	Because she will have either failed to scuttle Brexit and be sacrificed to save the Tories.
829815104	43	Or she steps aside for a true Brexiteer in the event of Parliament voting for an extension.
829815104	44	We’ll know this was the case if she does so.
829815104	45	Lots of ifs, I know, but right now everyone is doing the Juncker-Two-Step, lying and cajoling to maintain the status quo and continue forward towards further European integration.
829815104	46	Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank did his part, going full dove for the rest of 2019 to keep markets from imploding.
829815104	47	And if Brexit is settled on WTO terms that opens up their worst nightmare going forward.
829815104	48	Watch Viktor Orban smile the smile of the just at that point.

830153674	1	Britain’s Attorney General Deals Blow to May’s Rejigged Brexit Deal
830153674	3	Britain’s attorney general has dealt a potentially fatal blow to Theresa May’s rejigged Brexit deal as lawmakers prepare to vote on it later today.
830153674	4	The prime minister returned from Europe late Monday night with what she claimed were “legally binding” changes to the deal that was overwhelmingly rejected last month.
830153674	5	She claims the changes mean the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
830153674	6	Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has published legal advice that shoots down some of her claims.
830153674	7	He writes that if Britain wanted to remove itself from the backstop, it “would have… no internationally lawful means of exiting the [the backstop] arrangements, save by agreement [with the EU].” Support for the rejigged deal likely hinged on Cox’s confirmation that something substantial had changed.
830153674	8	The deal now appears to be heading for its second defeat in the House of Commons.
830274102	1	Theresa May Defeated Again as U.K. ‘Shitshow’ Threatens to Block Brexit
830274102	3	LONDON—It’s 17 days until Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
830274102	4	For just under two years, the British government has diverted all of its energy into hammering out a deal to ensure its exit was as smooth as possible.
830274102	5	On Tuesday night, it appeared that those efforts had amounted to absolutely nothing—and no one knows what happens next.
830274102	6	Despite Theresa May’s desperate 11th-hour attempts to polish her Brexit deal into something acceptable to lawmakers after they rejected it with the most overwhelming government defeat in British parliamentary history in January, the rejigged deal was knocked back again this evening in another whopping, and humiliating defeat—by 391 votes to 242.
830274102	7	The prime minister flew back from Strasbourg late Monday night with what she proudly claimed were “legally binding” changes to her deal.
830274102	8	She said the changes meant the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
830274102	9	She presented the plan to lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday morning—but a familiar disaster befell her.
830274102	10	Clearly feeling the strain of the late-night negotiations, her voice failed her and she croaked and spluttered her way through her crucial chance to sell her deal.
830274102	11	It wasn’t the first time: She famously suffered every keynote speaker’s worst nightmare in 2017 when her voice failed and her backdrop fell to pieces at the Tory party annual conference.
830274102	12	Lawmakers were not convinced by the faltering performance.
830274102	13	Britain’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox published legal advice Tuesday morning which rejected the idea that the changes would allow Britain to legally decide to exit the backstop without the agreement of the EU, potentially forcing it to adhere to the bloc’s customs rules against its will.
830274102	14	The staunchly anti-EU wing of May’s Conservative party, the European Research Group, announced they couldn’t back it.
830274102	15	Then the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party—whose support May relies on for winning votes with her minority government—also disowned it.
830274102	16	Its fate was sealed hours before the results came in on Tuesday evening.
830274102	17	“It’s a shitshow,” one Conservative MP told The Daily Beast.
830274102	18	Another, Sir Mike Penning, said: “It’s reached the stage where we don’t know what the hell is going to happen.”
830274102	19	What happens next doesn’t seem to be clear to anyone.
830274102	20	In the short term, there’s likely to be two more key votes in the House of Commons this week.
830274102	21	One will determine whether Parliament consents to leave the EU with no deal—which, based on previous results, is likely to be rejected.
830274102	22	The other will see lawmakers vote on whether to extend the 29 March 2019 deadline the U.K. set itself to leave the EU nearly two years ago.
830274102	23	That result is harder to predict as even lawmakers who think it’s a good idea will face a backlash from some constituents who will accuse them of trying to abandon the entire Brexit project.
830274102	24	What happens in the longer term is anyone’s guess.
830274102	25	Lawmakers are talking about a number of scenarios: a third vote on May’s deal either before or after a deadline extension; the highly uncertain scenario of leaving with no deal; or taking it to the public with a second referendum, or even a general election.
830274102	26	In one scenario forecast by Tory grandee Sir Charles Walker, May will now be forced to call a general election to try and end the impasse.
830274102	27	The vice chairman of the influential Conservative 1922 Committee said the administration had dissolved into chaos and—for the first time in at least a century—Britain’s government was incapable of functioning.
830274102	28	“If it was a horse with a broken fetlock, this Parliament, you’d probably put it down,” he said on Sky News.
830274102	29	There is also frustration among the more pragmatic MPs who feel the prime minister has done everything she can to compromise with the pro-Brexit lawmakers, and their intransigence is now the only thing that could prevent Brexit entirely.
830274102	30	One possibility—if all other options such as no deal or a deadline extension are ruled out—is that the deal is voted on a third time and, faced with prospect no Brexit happening at all, it’s passed.
830274102	31	“The reality is Brexiteer MPs need to come on board,” Paul Masterton MP told The Daily Beast.
830274102	32	“If they don’t, then they are putting their precious project at risk.
830274102	33	This is as Brexity as it’s going to get for them.
830274102	34	If the deal is defeated then all bets are off."
830274102	35	One of the few Conservative MPs who fell in behind May on Tuesday night after previously voting against the deal said he was partly motivated by the new concessions from Brussels but “more importantly if we don’t, there’s a good chance we won’t get any form of Brexit at all.”
830274102	36	Penning, who helped run May’s leadership campaign, had previously described the prime minister’s deal as “dead as a dodo” but he told The Daily Beast he had changed his mind because he feared his parliamentary colleagues would vote later this week “to block hard Brexit, which means we’ve got no negotiating position; so we’re stuffed—in this limbo forever and a day.”
830274102	37	However, Penning rejected Walker’s suggestion of a general election.
830274102	38	“Charlie is entitled to his opinion but firstly you need two-thirds of the House to vote for it, that ain’t gonna happen,” he said.
830274102	39	Penning dismissed speculation that No.
830274102	40	10 had encouraged Walker to go rogue in TV and radio studios ahead of the vote in order to try and scare a few more Conservatives into backing the prime minister.
830274102	41	“You don’t know Charlie Walker; he’s a very independently minded MP.”
830274102	42	In a bid to stave off an earlier defeat, May was forced to accept that if her deal was rejected for a second time, she would allow MPs to hold a vote the following day on whether they would accept a no-deal Brexit.
830274102	43	Since the triggering of Article 50—Britain’s formal request to leave the EU—a two-year countdown to March 29, 2019, began.
830274102	44	According to legislation passed by the House and still on the books, Britain will automatically plunge out of the EU in 17 days even if there is no withdrawal agreement.
830274102	45	A large majority of MPs believe that would be extremely damaging to Britain as decades of trade deals, cross-border agreements, regulations and rights would disappear in a puff of smoke.
830274102	46	It is therefore likely that the House of Commons will vote against no deal, that prospect increased when May reacted to her defeat by declaring that there would be a “free vote”—that means the government effectively does not even have a policy on one of the most important votes in a generation.
830274102	47	If Parliament does reject no-deal Brexit, another vote would be automatically triggered for Thursday.
830274102	48	This time the question put to lawmakers will be: Should Britain request a delay to Brexit?
830274102	49	It is much harder to predict how that vote would play out as both of the main party leaders have effectively lost control of their MPs and would not be able to enforce the party whip.
830274102	50	Substantial numbers of politicians on both sides believe delaying Brexit would be an insult to the electorate who voted to quite the EU in 2016; while similarly large numbers believe no deal must be avoided at all costs.
830274102	51	There is also a smaller group of MPs who are plotting to hold a second referendum and would therefore vote for as long a delay to Brexit as possible.
830274102	52	For once May captured the mood of the House of Commons late Tuesday night when she said: “These are unenviable choices.
830274102	53	Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”
830274102	54	Whatever Britain wants to do next, with 17 days to go until its membership of the European Union expires, it’s time to make a decision.
830359136	1	The Fight for Brexit
830359136	3	To see how serious the political elite’s war on Brexit has become, consider this: Tony Blair has been having secret talks with French president Emmanuel Macron on how to prevent Brexit from becoming a reality.
830359136	4	Apparently, Blair has told Macron to ‘stand [his] ground’ against any kind of so-called Hard Brexit and to use his clout, and the EU’s clout, to pressure Britain to stay in the Customs Union and maybe even to hold a second referendum.
830359136	5	To put this in plain, blunt English: a former British prime minister is conspiring with a foreign power to try to subvert the will of the British people.
830359136	6	In normal times, this would be a scandal of epic, epoch-defining proportions.
830359136	7	There might have been riots, certainly protests.
830359136	8	Blair would have been publicly shamed, possibly exiled.
830359136	9	His name would live in infamy.
830359136	10	But we don’t live in normal times.
830359136	11	We live in an era in which most of the political class has ditched even the pretence of feeling a strong attachment to democracy.
830359136	12	An era in reactionary anti-democratic sentiment is more casually expressed than at any other time in living memory.
830359136	13	An era in which the chattering classes nonchalantly call for the overthrow of the largest vote in British history (the vote for Brexit), in which parliamentarians explicitly pit themselves against the people’s will, and in which anyone who so much as raises a peep about any aspect of this polite tyranny will be slammed as a hard-right menace to public life.

830359136	16	And so there is no widespread outrage over the fact that a former British PM is meeting with a tinpot Jupiterian who has subjected his own people to months of extreme violence.
830359136	17	No frontpage denunciations of this Brit who has sided with the most violently repressive leader in Europe to try to ensure that the largest number of voters in British history don’t get what they want.
830359136	18	Indeed, I bet that if anyone were to suggest that Blair is a traitor, they would be railed against.
830359136	19	And yet, look up the word traitor in the dictionary.
830359136	20	‘A person who stops being loyal to their own country.’ What more apt description is there of a powerful Briton who is working with a foreign power to thwart the British people’s political desires?
830359136	21	‘How DARE you call us traitors?
830359136	22	!’ – Remainer elitists do protest too much.
830359136	23	The Blair / Macron love-in is in some ways a better snapshot of where Britain is at right now than what will happen in parliament this week.
830359136	24	For it reveals a bigger, more important truth than the parliamentary tussles over customs unions and delays to Article 50 do.
830359136	25	It confirms that the crisis facing Britain right now is not a technical one of how to leave the EU and whether leaving the EU will cause economic difficulty.
830359136	26	Rather, it is a crisis of democracy.
830359136	27	It is a situation in which the very democratic premise upon which modern Britain has been built – at least since 1928, when all adults, including women under 30, got the right to vote – is being called into question.
830359136	28	The scrapping over ‘how’ we Brexit disguises the far more profound question that has been thrown up by the British masses’ disobedient vote to Leave in June 2016.

830359423	3	After a lot of drama, British Prime Minister Theresa May came back from Brussels with a breakthrough on Brexit.
830359423	4	Only it wasn’t.
830359423	5	While the changes to the protocol that governs the implementation of the Irish Backstop are an improvement they are far fro enough to allay the rightful fears of Brexiteers and the Northern Irish.
830359423	6	From the beginning of this process, the EU has been in blackmail mode.
830359423	7	They’ve made it clear that they would not negotiate in good faith or even at all.
830359423	8	That much has been clear.
830359423	9	The biggest question has been whether May herself was working in the British people’s best interest or was she simply a stalking horse for further EU integration of the entire continent of Europe.
830359423	10	Never forget that the EU has imperial ambitions.
830359423	11	Those that have been its architects saw it as regaining the mantle of the center of the world as the U.S. bankrupts itself maintaining an empire around the world, fighting against the rise of Russia and China.

830359423	18	Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.
830359423	19	This point cannot be understated.
830359423	20	Because it is the model for how the EU will fight the rising opposition to its rule.
830359423	21	The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.
830359423	22	It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.
830359423	23	It was designed to cause irreparable damage to the U.K. with the long-term effects of destroying the majority political parties and fanning separatist instincts in Wales and Scotland.
830359423	24	And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no-deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.
830359423	25	Poll after poll shows overwhelming rejection of May’s Merkel’s deal as well as growing support for a No-Deal Brexit.
830359423	26	And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.
830359423	27	Businesses are relocating, shipments are stopping, etc.
830359423	28	All because of Brexit, they argue.
830359423	29	No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.
830359423	30	Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.
830359423	31	Theresa May’s performance in parliament before the latest vote was almost convincing.
830359423	32	But, as always, when someone is giving you an ultimatum, my way or the highway, it’s masking an alternative choice.
830359423	33	The Dublin Unionist Party and the European Research Group within the Tories understand this.
830359423	34	I suspect in his heart of hearts Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn
830359423	35	And the reason for this is May was always on their side.
830359423	36	It’s not a negotiation when there’s only one side represented.
830359423	37	This is why Juncker et.al.
830359423	38	refused to negotiate in any meaningful way.
830359423	39	They didn’t have to.
830359423	40	Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details)
830359423	41	And that is simply blackmail.
830359423	42	What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.
830359423	43	Because any organization that would blackmail rather than negotiate is not an organization anyone decent person would want to be a member of.
830359423	44	Fears over a No-Deal Brexit are overblown.
830359423	45	If these same MP’s that are so worried about the uncertainty created by the Brexit process would simply end that uncertainty by backing No-Deal then certainty would return.
830359423	46	It might not be the certainty that is the easiest to swallow for both sides but it will be certainty.
830359423	47	Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.
830359423	48	That’s an insult and it should be treated as such by Parliament.
830359423	49	But it won’t be as MP’s roll over, show Juncker their bellies and hand-wring about how unfair it all is again later this week.
830359423	50	They cannot see the bigger picture that it is the EU that has the weak hand, not them.
830359423	51	They are too blinded by ideology and fear to see that.

830821478	1	Britain Begs the EU for a Brexit Deadline Extension to Work Out What it Actually Wants
830821478	3	Britain will beg the European Union for a delay to its EU withdrawal to give a desperate Theresa May more time to find a way out her Brexit mess.
830821478	4	In a series of votes Thursday, members of parliament [MPs] voted to instruct May to go back to the EU to request a new Brexit deadline.
830821478	5	The British government wants to extend the current deadline for three months if May’s hated Brexit deal is approved by March 29.
830821478	6	If she can’t get that through parliament, there could be a much longer delay.
830821478	7	Britain can’t decide to extend the Brexit deadline by itself, however.
830821478	8	That will require the approval of each member state of the EU which is by no means guaranteed unless May can give them good reason to allow her more time for to work on a deal many consider to be dead.
830821478	9	If British lawmakers don’t approve May’s deal by March 29, and an extension isn’t approved by the EU, then the country is still set to crash out of the bloc without a deal in 15 days.
830821478	10	Earlier in the day, the government revealed it intended to hold a third vote on May’s deal some time next week.
830821478	11	If it completes a trilogy of defeats, MPs will then get to vote on a range of options to indicate exactly how they want to proceed without May’s deal and without leaving with no deal.
830821478	12	However, changing course would cause a much longer Brexit delay which the government warned could cause “real damage to the public's faith” in politics.
830821478	13	A British government minister told The Daily Beast that the prime minister will now begin what amounts to a bribery campaign in which she’ll throw money at members of parliament for their pet projects to win their backing for her deal by the end of the new propsed deadline.
830821478	14	“I suspect the big HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] chequebook is about to be dusted off and promissory notes to fall like confetti,” said the minister
830821478	15	The government also hopes the threat of a much longer delay will force the hand of the anti-EU MPs who voted against her deal—believing it would keep the U.K. too closely entwined with Europe—and bring them into line in a potentially-decisive third vote to make sure Brexit happens.
830821478	16	A spokesman for the European Commission reiterated that a deadline extension would require the “unanimous agreement” of all its member states, and each leader will have to “consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.”
830821478	17	A separate vote Thursday saw lawmakers overwhelmingly reject the idea of a second referendum on independence.
830821478	18	Although it wasn’t a legally-binding vote and doesn’t completely rule out the prospect of another referendum, the number of lawmakers who voted against it indicate it is unlikely to win a majority at any time in the near future.
830821478	19	MPs also rejected the chance to wrestle the Brexit process away from the prime minister by turning down a measure which would have given them control of parliamentary time next week to arrange a series of votes on alternative brexit options.
830821478	20	That measure—rejected by just two votes—would have allowed MPs to find a way forward on Brexit without May’s deal.
830821478	21	That means MPs have this week voted against May’s deal, against leaving the EU with no deal, against holding a second referendum, and against using their power to find an alternative route to get Britain out of the Brexit stalemate it finds itself in.
830821478	22	The decision to delay Brexit came after a week of humiliation for the prime minister—a feeling she must be used to by now.
830821478	23	Lawmakers rejected her deal for a second time on Tuesday night in a defeat which was only marginally better than in January when it suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.
830821478	24	Then, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted against the U.K. ever leaving the EU without a deal.
830821478	25	Although that vote wasn’t legally binding, it was another crushing government defeat which some of her own ministers decided to abstain on.
830821478	26	May’s misery wasn’t helped by Donald Trump on Thursday when he said he was “surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations” and criticized the prime minister because she didn't listen to his advice on Brexit, commenting: “It could have been negotiated in a different manner.” May revealed in July last year that Trump told her, in typical Trump fashion, the best way forward would be to sue the EU.Asked if he thinks the Brexit deadline should be extended, Trump said: “I think they are probably going to have to do something, because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that.”
830821478	27	However, the president warned against a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying it would be “unfair to people who have won.”
832269185	1	Brexit delay request will be rejected if no guarantees of deal success – France’s Le Drian
832269185	3	Britain’s request for a Brexit delay will be turned down by the EU if Prime Minister Theresa May cannot provide sufficient guarantees that the British parliament will approve the negotiated divorce, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
832269185	4	The minister told France’s parliament that May would need to make her case at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday, Reuters reports.
832269185	5	“A situation in which Mrs May would not be able to present to the European Council sufficient guaranties about the credibility of her strategy would lead to the extension request being dismissed and opting for a no-deal exit,” Le Drian said.
832269185	6	All remaining EU 27 members must agree on any extension.
832918490	1	Adam Schiff Threatens to Subpoena Mueller After Russia Probe Wraps
832918490	3	Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that his panel will subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if more details regarding his report on possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia is required.
832918490	4	“If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee,” Schiff told CNN host Wolf Blitzer, adding that the House Judiciary Committee could request Attorney General Bill Barr testify on the report’s findings, as well.
832918490	5	Mueller delivered his report to Barr on Friday and said that he could brief Congressional leaders on its findings as early as this weekend.
832918490	6	Schiff continued:
832918490	7	At the end of the day, the (Justice) department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
832918490	8	And it’s hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
832918490	9	This began as a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI.
832918490	10	It began as the same in our committee, and we have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.
832918490	11	The California Democrat made no mention whether Mueller’s possible testimony would be public or closed-door.
832920387	1	Mueller's Investigation Lasted 674 Days.
832920387	2	Here's How That Compares to Other Probes
832920387	4	Longer than Watergate, but much shorter than Iran-Contra or Whitewater.
832920387	5	That’s how Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation stacks up compared to other independent probes by the Justice Department.
832920387	6	The investigation concluded Friday when Mueller sent a final report to Attorney General William Barr — 674 days after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed him as special counsel to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
832920387	7	(The final number may be a few days longer, as a Mueller spokesman said staffers will stick around to close up shop.)
832920387	8	The next phase will begin shortly, as the Department of Justice, the White House and Congress hash out how much of the report to make public.
832920387	9	“I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr wrote in a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

832920387	12	Given the complexity of Mueller’s investigation, which resulted in the indictment, conviction or guilty plea from 34 people and three companies plus several other investigations referred to career prosecutors, the probe moved swiftly.
832920387	13	But it was also much shorter than some other notable probes by special counsels and special prosecutors in the past.Here’s how the length of Mueller’s probe compares to previous investigations.
832920387	14	Watergate: 155 days
832920387	15	Five men were arrested while trying to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972, but it took several months before the Washington Post confirmed that break-in was linked to President Richard Nixon.
832920387	16	A special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was not appointed to investigate Nixon’s involvement until May 18, 1973.
832920387	17	On October 20, 1973, Nixon was successful in requesting the Acting Attorney General to fire Cox, after both the previous attorney general and deputy attorney general refused and resigned.
832920387	18	Cox’s investigation lasted 155 days.
832920387	19	Nixon resigned nine months later, on Aug. 9, 1974.
832920387	20	Waco: 316 days
832920387	21	In February 1993, federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives raided a Branch Davidian religious compound near Waco, Texas, after the agency heard reports that the Christian cult, under the leadership of David Koresh, had stockpiled  illegal firearms and explosives.A 51-day standoff resulted in a violent gun battle that led to 76 deaths, including more than two dozen children.
832920387	22	The FBI did not believe Koresh when he said he and his followers would come out eventually, and so the FBI deposited containers of gas in the compound on April 19, 1993.
832920387	23	Next, gunfire and flames seemed to break out simultaneously, and firefighters could not enter the compound.
832920387	24	On Sept. 9, 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno named former Sen. John Danforth as special counsel to head a review of what happened in 1993, after the FBI uncovered information suggesting “incendiary or pyrotechnic devices may have been used.” On July 21, 2000, Danforth released findings that concluded federal agents did not fire shots at members of the religious group, nor did they start the deadly fire.
832920387	25	His investigation lasted 316 days.
832920387	26	The Starr Report: 1,693 days
832920387	27	In January 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske Jr. as the independent counsel in charge of investigating financial irregularities at Whitewater Development Corp., an investment that Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved with.
832920387	28	In August 1994, Kenneth Starr replaced Fiske as independent counsel.
832920387	29	Reno approved Starr’s request to expand his investigation to include Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in January 1998.
832920387	30	Eight months later, on September 9, 1998, Starr released a report to Congress outlining 11 possible grounds for impeachment.
832920387	31	Two days later, the report was made public.
832920387	32	Between Fiske’s appointment and Starr’s release of his report to Congress, 1,693 days passed.
832920387	33	Ultimately, in February 1999, the Senate acquitted President Clinton of the two articles of impeachment he faced: perjury and obstruction of justice.
832920387	34	Iran-Contra: 2,420 days
832920387	35	Around 1986, President Ronald Reagan’s administration sold arms to Iran, which was at war with Iraq.
832920387	36	In exchange for the weapons, Iran was supposed to help the United States procure the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
832920387	37	Profits from the deal then went to “contras,” rebel groups who were fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua at the time.
832920387	38	The United States was not supposed to sell weapons to Iran or pay ransoms, so Attorney General Edwin Meese III requested that an independent prosecutor be appointed.
832920387	39	On Dec. 19, 1986, a panel of judges appointed Lawrence Walsh.
832920387	40	The Department of Justice confirmed that appointment a few months later.
832920387	41	Walsh’s investigation lasted approximately eight years and resulted in charges against 14 people.
832920387	42	He submitted his final report to the U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 4, 1993, meaning his probe lasted about 2,420 days.

832926076	10	While her husband is under intense scrutiny, all eyes were on Melania during the photo call.
832926076	11	Melania wore a linen silk dress from UK brand LK Bennett featuring distracting bold orange, white and black Aztec-inspired prints.
832926076	12	The cinched-in-at-the-waist 'Andrea' round-neck occasion dress is currently on sale for $282.50, down from $565.
832926076	13	Melania paired the midi-length half price frock with Christian Louboutin heels.
832926076	14	The First Lady had a breezy attitude as she took to social media to speak about her day with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Haiti President Jovenel Moise, Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet, Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, and Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.
832926076	15	'Enjoyed hosting the leaders & their delegations,' she posted on Twitter about the day at West Palm Beach.

832926076	19	Earlier Trump had shared a video on Twitter from inside his meeting.
832926076	20	Making no mention of the Mueller report, he posted: 'Today in Florida, @FLOTUS and I were honored to welcome and meet with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia!'
832926076	21	He arrived on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport waving to supporters.
832926076	22	Late on Friday Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News: 'This marks the end of the Russia investigation.
832926076	23	We await a disclosure of the facts.
832926076	24	We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscores what the president has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong.'

832926076	33	'Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department's long-standing practices and policies,' he added Friday.
832926076	34	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement: 'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.
832926076	35	'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.'

832931332	1	What happens after no one goes to jail?
832931332	3	Our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom
832931332	4	What happens after no one goes to jail?
832931332	5	And so, the Mueller Investigation into the alleged Trump-Russian Collusion to fix the 2016 general election against Hillary goes the way of similar investigations that have proceeded it.
832931332	6	Nowhere.
832931332	7	In the relatively recent past, we’ve watched, not in any particular order, Plamegate, Benghazi, the IRS suppression of Tea Party groups, Fast & Furious, Uranium One, and that brief puppet show that accompanied the F.B.I.
832931332	8	inquiry into classified documents found on Hillary Clinton’s private server.
832931332	9	Further back, there was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the assassination of the President of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, and his brother/advisor Ngo Dinh Nhu – twenty days before another Presidential assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.
832931332	10	And, oh, can’t forget Iran Contra and Whitewater.
832931332	11	And so, the Mueller Investigation of alleged Trump collusion with the Russians to assure his election joins the growing list.
832931332	12	Now, this evening from the Swamp, comes confirmation that, all along, there’s been no there there.
832931332	13	About half the adults in America knew as much from the get-go.
832931332	14	The intrepid, two-year running, deadly serious reports on the “investigation” coming from the breathless voices of the “news” media, supported by indignantly outraged politicians, ran the dial on our Bravo Sierra Meter into the red zone, almost daily.
832931332	15	Suppose they’ll apologize to the nation?
832931332	16	Many of us have learned from past experience how to see.
832931332	17	For example, we soon realized there was no serious inquiry into Benghazi.
832931332	18	Same for the Clinton Foundation, as well as for all the nefarious deeds related to the nation’s premier power couple.
832931332	19	We shrug—it is what it is—what can we do about it?
832931332	20	The FISA Court, created in the wake of 911, has become the means to conduct secret, unsubstantiated, investigations against political adversaries.
832931332	21	Hi ho.
832931332	22	NSA vacuuming up of a kazillion phone calls is, we’re told, for our protection and well-being.
832931332	23	Sure it is.
832931332	24	Unmasking of persons, led by the Obama administration’s U.S.
832931332	25	Ambassador to the U.N. and the Queen of Unmasking, Samantha Powers, was, well, it must have been justified, right?
832931332	26	Part of keeping us safe.
832931332	27	In the end, the important question is this: What happens when no one goes to jail?
832931332	28	After it becomes clear, even to Helen Keller were she here to witness events, that it’s all been a charade.
832931332	29	And the people indicted by Mueller et al were collateral damage in what the President has long called a “Witch Hunt.” Like a Salem Witch, it was him they meant to burn alive.
832931332	30	And don’t think they won’t keep trying, even though this episode has come to a flat end.
832931332	31	Even on this evening, March 22, 2019, it’s clear that liberals on virtually all the major networks, including FOX, will say, “Well, yea, but it’s not over yet.
832931332	32	There’s still…and…bla bla bla.” Breathe deep, and sip wine to stomach it all.
832931332	33	We wonder, a lot of us: Has government corruption always been a constant in the Swamp?
832931332	34	Of course, it has.
832931332	35	But does it seem to be escalating in its frequency and intensity?
832931332	36	Yes, it does.
832931332	37	And in other cases, both mentioned above and unlisted, what happens when none of those who plan, execute, and benefit from the corruption—what happens when not one of them go to jail?
832931332	38	Or, are in any meaningful way, otherwise held accountable?
832931332	39	We should assume these two things will happen.
832931332	40	First, our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom.
832931332	41	Until, eventually, we will lose the right to claim it.
832931332	42	And the second thing to happen will be this: The corruption will continue to replicate itself and get worse.
832931332	43	In the days ahead, we will be repeatedly reminded that Robert Mueller III is a man of stellar integrity, heralded by those in the Swamp as a fearless crime fighter, a former Marine hero in Vietnam.
832931332	44	I have a friend from college who was a genuine gun fighter.
832931332	45	He joined the Corps as a Private—came out a Major, with a Silver Star.
832931332	46	He’s featured in a book about the legendary First Marine Recon in Vietnam.
832931332	47	He’s alive and well today.
832931332	48	In my high school band, I sat next to a small, Hispanic kid.
832931332	49	Once out of school, he joined the Marine Corps, and went to Vietnam.

832933796	3	President Donald Trump’s advisers feel upbeat that special counsel Robert Mueller “doesn’t have the goods” to formally accuse the president of colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election or charge that he obstructed justice, according to the Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig.
832933796	4	The comprehensive report, still confidential, marks the end of Mueller’s probe but sets the stage for big public fights to come.
832933796	5	The next steps are up to Attorney General William Barr, to Congress and, in all likelihood, federal courts.
832933796	6	The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
832933796	7	Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be released publicly before long and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
832933796	8	President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery was that he is “glad it’s over,” according to sources close to ABC News.
832933796	9	Barr released a letter noting his plans to write his own account of Mueller’s findings.
832933796	10	The White House released a statement saying it had not seen or been briefed on the special counsel’s document.
832933796	11	What happens next is “up to Attorney General Barr,” said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
832933796	12	Barr said he could send his account to Congress quickly.
832933796	13	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr said in his letter to top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.
832933796	14	He pledged a commitment to transparency.
832933796	15	The attorney general said the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to Congress to ensure there was no political inference in the independent probe.

832934428	3	Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) seemed to push aside special counsel Robert Mueller report pointing to “other entities” investigating the Trump Organizations.
832934428	4	Hirono said, “This is the way I look at it.
832934428	5	This is the end of the beginning.

832934428	7	So there’s more to come.
832934428	8	I think the president should be concerned.”
832934428	9	She added, “And if we look at his tweets of late where he has been all over the place with regard to Golan Heights and North Korea and all of that.
832934428	10	It seems like the president is very concerned in spite of saying, Oh the Mueller report, I don’t know about that.

832940138	3	President Donald Trump gives the thumbs-up as he arrives on Air Force One on March 22 at Palm Beach International Airport, en route to Mar-a-Lago.
832940138	4	By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Robert Mueller or Russia.| AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster White House Trump faces Mueller report in Mar-a-Lago bubble he president kicked off a weekend at Mar-a-Lago with a speech at a fundraising dinner but few words about special counsel Robert Mueller.
832940138	5	PALM BEACH, Florida –When the news finally broke that Robert Mueller had completed his investigation, President Donald Trump was cloistered in the safe space of his private club here, surrounded by senior aides and the diehard supporters who pay big bucks to catch a glimpse of him..
832940138	6	As Washington melted down over the long-awaited news 1,000 miles away, the fierce Trump defenders here girded for an epic battle.
832940138	7	Story Continued Below“He seems to be able to deal with most of the stuff that most people can’t.
832940138	8	I am convinced that he can weather anything he’s put through,”” said Joyce Lewis Bass, a board member of the Boca Raton Regional Republican Club.
832940138	9	On Friday night, just feet from where Trump and his family were having dinner, local Republicans were holding a fundraising dinner.
832940138	10	The logo for the event: a five-dollar bill featuring a MAGA-hat clad Abraham Lincoln.
832940138	11	Organizers had held out hope that Trump would make an appearance at the event, and White House officials initially signaled he wouldn't attend, saying he planned to spend his night on Mar-a-Lago’s patio with First Lady Melania Trump, their son Barron, and Melania Trump’s parents.
832940138	12	poster="http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201903/3951/1155968404_6013529254001_6013519949001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404" true
832940138	13	But Trump couldn't resist.
832940138	14	The president spoke to the cheering crowd for about two minutes, with the first lady standing beside him on stage, according to a video of his remarks obtained by POLITICO.
832940138	15	He said nothing about the Mueller news.
832940138	16	Instead, he thanked “the legendary Pam Bondi,” Florida’s former attorney general who was honored at the dinner, and marveled at the first lady’s poll numbers.
832940138	17	The president also cracked a joke about the keynote speaker, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
832940138	18	“If Lindsey’s speaking, I want to come down here,” Trump said, “for two reasons.
832940138	19	No.
832940138	20	1: he’s a great speaker.
832940138	21	And No.
832940138	22	2, I know if I’m here, he’s not going to say anything bad about me.”
832940138	23	The dinner capped another whirlwind day for Trump.
832940138	24	As they braced for the report throughout the day Friday, Trump and his team tried to convey an image of a president putting his head down and focusing on the job. Aides arranged a meeting with the leaders of five Caribbean countries, the president announced his pick to join the Federal Reserve and he bragged about the defeat of the Islamic State.But Trump quickly overshadowed those efforts, issuing a confusing tweet that implied he was undoing North Korea sanctions that his administration had just put in place.
832940138	25	The tweet caught many in the White House by surprise and the administration later tried to clarify, insisting he was referring instead to not-yet-imposed sanctions.

832940138	29	Trump’s Islamic State victory lap was also quickly undercut.
832940138	30	At the end of the flight to Florida, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders entered Air Force One’s press cabin wielding a map.
832940138	31	ISIS no longer holds any territory in Syria, she declared, without offering any other details.
832940138	32	Trump later held up the same map, at one point displaying it upside down, boasting about his success in diminishing the terrorist group.
832940138	33	“So here is ISIS on Election Day.
832940138	34	Here's ISIS right now,” he said.
832940138	35	The only problem: the graphic didn’t compare ISIS’s current territory to Election Day in 2016.
832940138	36	According to photographs captured by reporters, it compared the territory to 2014, undercutting the president’s about turning things around immediately after taking office.
832940138	37	“You guys can have the map.
832940138	38	Congratulations.
832940138	39	You’ll spread it around,” Trump told reporters, handing them the document.
832940138	40	Sanders quickly snatched up the paper.
832940138	41	Trump tried to project calm throughout the day, distancing himself from the image of a man about to suffer a political blow.
832940138	42	On his arrival at the airport here, he delighted in the adoration of his supporters, signing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.
832940138	43	But there were more subtle signs that the White House — like all of Washington — had assumed crash position ahead of the transmittal of Mueller’s report to Attorney General Bill Barr, which happened at 5pm, shortly after a sudden blinding hailstorm tore through an already-anxious capital: White House counsel Pat Cipollone joined the president at Mar-a-Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter, as did Sanders, who doesn’t always travel with the president on weekend trips.
832940138	44	“We'll see what happens,” Trump had said early in the day as he departed for his weekend in Florida.
832940138	45	“There was no collusion.
832940138	46	There was no obstruction,” he repeated once again.
832940138	47	“Everybody knows it.
832940138	48	It's all a big hoax.
832940138	49	It's all a witch hunt.”
832940138	50	But he didn’t mention Mueller for the rest of the day.
832940138	51	Though the president is often eager to field reporters’ questions, he ignored journalists as he sat alongside the Caribbean leaders, under two gold and crystal chandeliers.
832940138	52	For once, it seemed, Trump felt he had nothing more to say.
832940138	53	He was content to wait.
832940138	54	By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Mueller or Russia.
832940138	55	Friday's fundraising dinner was hosted by the Palm Beach County Republicans.
832940138	56	Tickets for the fundraiser started at $375, with sponsorship packages going as high as $25,000.
832940138	57	On Friday afternoon, a person helping to organize the dinner predicted Trump would attend, especially given that the event was held just feet from the room where Trump huddled with the Caribbean leaders.
832940138	58	“We very much expect the president to come,” the person said.
832940138	59	“It’s in his house.”
832940138	60	The mood at Mar-a-Lago Friday afternoon was low-key, despite the furor over the Mueller developments swirling in Washington.
832940138	61	A nearby parking lot was packed with luxury cars, including a bright yellow Porsche and a chrome Rolls Royce.
832940138	62	A woman in the parking lot sported a black fur coat in the nearly 75-degree weather.
832940138	63	Mueller’s actual conclusions remain under lock and key at the Justice Department.
832940138	64	But supporters here seemed unfazed by the report’s imminent disclosure.
832940138	65	Asked if she’s certain the president can overcome the Mueller probe’s findings, Toni Holt Kramer, a Mar-a-Lago member and founder of the Trumpettes USA, a Trump fan club, said via email, “Positive!!

832941978	1	Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over
832941978	3	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has said that he believes there will likely be further indictments from Robert Mueller as the full contents of his report are looked at in closer detail.
832941978	4	Schiff suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is contained in the long-awaited document.
832941978	5	'If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,' the California Democrat said during an interview Friday on CNN.
832941978	6	Scroll down for video
832941978	7	House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said Friday that he's willing to subpoena Robert Mueller and Attorney General Barr, if needed, to push for disclosure
832941978	8	'At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
832941978	9	And it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
832941978	10	'We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.'
832941978	11	Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to AG William Barr Friday afternoon
832941978	12	Schiff was asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would be satisfied if 'the most sensitive information' obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called 'gang of eight'.
832941978	13	'No, it would not suffice.
832941978	14	Now, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but the volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.
832941978	15	'We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.'
832941978	16	In another interview with MSNBC, Schiff said that it is entirely likely that more indictments could be forthcoming, saying instead it is 'entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be' more.
832941978	17	'Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,' he said.
832941978	18	'It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments.
832941978	19	'In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.
832941978	20	'Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.'
832941978	21	How the news broke: This is the letter Bill Barr, the attorney general, sent to the chairs and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees, revealing the Mueller probe is over
832941978	22	Though Trump himself has said the report should be made public, it's not clear whether the administration would fight subpoenas for testimony or block the transmission of grand jury material.
832941978	23	If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena.
832941978	24	A court fight could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court.
832941978	25	But few tussles between Congress and the White House get that far.
832941978	26	They often are resolved through negotiation.
832941978	27	The Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, could also formally ask Mueller to send his committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump, as suggested by Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.
832941978	28	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding to see the full Mueller report immediately
832941978	29	'There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr' shouldn't release the full report, said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
832941978	30	With Attorney General William Barr vowing to rush out information on the report's 'principal conclusions' as soon as this weekend, Democrats were insisting they see both the complete document and the evidence in its entirety.
832941978	31	'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.
832941978	32	'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,' the leaders said.
832941978	33	'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	34	The watchword is transparency,' they said.
832941978	35	President Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, in Washington
832941978	36	Speaking to reporters Friday, Schumer said: 'The American people have a right to the truth.
832941978	37	The watchword is transparency.'
832941978	38	He added: 'The president himself has called without qualification or the report to be made public.
832941978	39	There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr should do any less.'
832941978	40	Schumer predicted the effort ultimately would prevail due to public sentiment.
832941978	41	'The demand of the public is overwhelming to see the report when it's on such a serious matter and it will be made public.
832941978	42	Public pressure will force it to be,' he said.
832941978	43	Barr himself pledged transparency during his Senate confirmation hearing.
832941978	44	But the strong defender of presidential power also left open the possibility he would share his own summary, rather than the report itself, to Congress – a move that would provoke a fight with the Democratic House.
832941978	45	Although there were reports Mueller would bring no additional indictments, there remained the possibility of indictments already sealed, or that another body such as the Southern District of New York wold bring indictments.
832941978	46	Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told MSNBC there was a 'high probability' that could happen.
832941978	47	'I think there is a strong possibility of additional indictments, including president Trump's family,' Blumenthal said Friday evening.
832941978	48	'Maybe not by the Department of Justice, main Justice.
832941978	49	But by other offices.
832941978	50	I know that you want to stick to the Mueller report.
832941978	51	But the Mueller report cannot be viewed in isolation,' the former prosecutor and Trump nemesis continued.
832941978	52	'Any more than an investigation, even though it may end, cannot lead to additional investigative leads and actions.
832941978	53	And so I think there's a high probability of additional indictments.'
832941978	54	With the White House already resisting document requests from the Democratic Congress, lawmakers want to get hold of Mueller's work product and use it as the basis for additional investigation.
832941978	55	Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary panels, bluntly told CNN Friday afternoon: 'We want the full report.
832941978	56	We want it now.
832941978	57	We want it before the president is able to get it or make any edits.'
832941978	58	Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who is ramping up his own investigations
832941978	59	The president is a subject.
832941978	60	He's a subject of the investigation.
832941978	61	He has an inherent conflict of interest,' Swalwell continued.
832941978	62	'It's really inappropriate that he would even touch this.
832941978	63	IF he didn't do anything wrong, he would keep his hands off it.'
832941978	64	Sand Senate Intelligence Committee Co-chair Democrat Mark Warner: 'Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts of the Mueller report for themselves.
832941978	65	It must be provided to Congress immediately, and the AG should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
832941978	66	Nothing short of that will suffice.'
832941978	67	Warner added on Twitter: 'Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.'
832941978	68	House Judiciary ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia, joined the call for the release of the Mueller report.
832941978	69	'After nearly two years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, and I look forward to reviewing Attorney General Barr's report carefully, when it becomes available.
832941978	70	I fully expect the Justice Department to release the special counsel's report to this committee and to the public without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,' Collins said.
832941978	71	'We want the full report.
832941978	72	We want it now,' said Rep. Eric Swalwell of California
832941978	73	Special Counsel Robert Muller arrives at his office building, Thursday, March 21, 2019, in Washington
832941978	74	Barr told key lawmakers: 'I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,' he wrote.
832941978	75	That raised the possibility that he would provide a mere summary of Mueller's findings, which could leave information that didn't result in charges out of the matter.
832941978	76	Trump said that he would have no objection to the public release of Mueller's findings – although he was not specific as to what he would see released.
832941978	77	'I don't mind,' he said.
832941978	78	'Let it come out,' Trump declared.
832941978	79	'Let people see it.'
832941978	80	And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the public via Twitter Friday afternoon: 'The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.'
832947554	1	Tom Steyer Rallies Supporters after Conclusion of Mueller Report
832947554	3	Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer issued a video on Friday rallying supporters after the lackluster conclusion of the report issued by special counsel Robert Mueller.
832947554	4	Mueller’s report did not include any additional criminal indictments, despite leftists dreaming that President Donald Trump or members of his family would be sent to jail as a result of the investigation.
832947554	5	Steyer called for “perspective,” reminding them that Mueller already indicted people connected to Trump such as Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.
832947554	6	“It has already led to the indictment of 34 individuals,” Steyer said, leaving out the fact that 26 of them were Russians as well as three Russian companies.
832947554	7	He reminded supporters that the Mueller report had sparked other investigations into “Mr.
832947554	8	Trump’s criminality.”
832947554	9	Steyer called for Attorney General William Barr to do a full release of the report.
832947554	10	He urged supporters to cling to the idea that Trump already “participated in crimes” while in the presidency.

832947600	1	Grassley: Attempts to Keep Collusion Narrative Alive Will Harm U.S.
832947600	3	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Senate Finance Committee chairman, declared the Russian collusion narrative dead on Friday, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to Attorney General William Barr, with no further indictments planned.
832947600	4	“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries,” the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee said in a statement.He also noted that Mueller has been investigating any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin for “nearly two years now,” and the Justice Department even before the 2016 election.
832947600	5	He also slammed the “millions” in taxpayer dollars and “aggressive surveillance tools” used, with still no evidence of collusion.
832947600	6	“We know that the Russians tried to meddle in our democratic processes to sow divisions, as they have in so many other countries.
832947600	7	But throughout this prolonged investigation, which cost tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and included aggressive surveillance tools, we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion,” he said.
832947600	8	Grassley joined fellow members of Congress in asking for Mueller’s findings to be released, to “finally put an end” to the “speculation and innuendo” that has plagued the administration since its inauguration.
832947600	9	“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
832947600	10	Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.
832947852	1	Top 10 Propagandists Who Pushed Russia Collusion Hoax
832947852	3	Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his final report to Attorney General William Barr, marking the official end of the investigation — and with no further indictments on the way.
832947852	4	Although it is not yet known what is in the report, and it could still contain information damaging to the administration, the revelation that there will be no new indictments suggests that the Russia collusion theory is a bust.
832947852	5	Yet since the summer of 2016, there were countless pushers of the narrative that President Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, specifically by conspiring with Russia to steal and distribute stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
832947852	6	This included anonymous current and former officials and those in the media willing to publish their allegations, friends of those officials, Democrat members of Congress, those wanting to promote themselves, and of course, Clinton and her campaign officials.
832947852	7	Here are ten of the top promoters of the narrative:
832947852	8	CNN — CNN first reported that President Trump was briefed on the “pee dossier,” which prompted BuzzFeed to publish the dossier in full.
832947852	9	CNN has also given vast amounts of airtime to analysts, former officials, and Democrat lawmakers pushing the Russia collusion narrative.
832947852	10	It has also published a number of stories that advanced the narrative, including several that turned out to be false.
832947852	11	BuzzFeed — BuzzFeed first published the “pee dossier” in full — which released to the public unfounded accusations against President Trump, including the unverified claim that he hired prostitutes to urinate on a bed during a visit to Moscow in 2013.
832947852	12	At the time of publish, the dossier remained “salacious and unverified,” in then-FBI Director James Comey’s own words.
832947852	13	The Washington Post — The Washington Post was on the forefront of publishing anonymously-sourced stories suggesting collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials.
832947852	14	It published the intelligence leak that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak that led to his firing later.
832947852	15	Flynn ended up pleading guilty to one count of lying.
832947852	16	There were no collusion charges.
832947852	17	The New York Times — The New York Times published a front-page, top-of-the-page story on Inauguration Day suggesting that President-elect Trump’s associates had been “wiretapped.” Though the report admitted, “It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself,” it set the very inauguration of President Trump as part of a Russian conspiracy.
832947852	18	Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) — Schiff, now the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been the No.
832947852	19	1 pusher of the Russia collusion hoax in Congress.
832947852	20	Absent any direct evidence of collusion, Schiff has argued for months that the evidence is “hiding in plain sight.” Schiff has also tried to fundraise off of the hoax.
832947852	21	Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) — Lieu has been a close second to Schiff’s promotion of the Russia hoax in Congress.
832947852	22	He once called for a pause in the “entire Trump agenda” until an investigation into the collusion ties was completed.
832947852	23	Benjamin Wittes — Wittes, a journalist who is close to former FBI Director James Comey, was a lead inciter on Twitter of the Russia hoax, infamously tweeting cannon gifs every time a new sensational report came out that advanced the Russia collusion narrative.
832947852	24	Louise Mensch — Mensch, a former British parliamentarian, has become a household name among the anti-Trump resistance in the U.S., with her fantastical tweets about “sealed indictments” and grand juries.
832947852	25	Hillary Clinton — Clinton, the day after losing the election to Trump, wanted to promote the idea that Comey’s reopening of the investigation into her emails and Russia led to her defeat, according to the book Shattered.
832947852	26	“She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” a Clinton ally told the book’s authors.
832947852	27	Robby Mook — Mook was the first Clinton campaign official to go on record suggesting there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, during an ABC News interview at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, shortly after stolen DNC emails were released.

832948083	3	Mueller concludes Russia-Trump probe; lawmakers urge immediate release
832948083	4	WASHINGTON: Special counsel Robert Mueller closed his long and contentious Russia investigation with no new charges Friday, ending the probe that has cast a dark shadow over Donald Trump’s presidency but launching a fresh wave of political battles over the still-confidential findings.
832948083	5	The report’s details remained a mystery, accessible to only a handful of Justice Department officials while Attorney General William Barr prepared to release the “principal findings” soon.
832948083	6	But the closure of the 22-month probe without additional indictments by Mueller was welcome news to some in Trump’s orbit who had feared a final round of charges could ensnare more Trump associates, including members of the president’s family.
832948083	7	The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
832948083	8	Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
832948083	9	The next step is up to Barr, who is charged with writing his own account of Mueller’s findings and sending it to Congress.
832948083	10	In a letter to lawmakers , he declared he was committed to transparency and speed.
832948083	11	He said he could provide details as soon as this weekend.
832948083	12	The White House sought to keep some distance from the report, saying it had not seen or been briefed on the document.
832948083	13	Trump, surrounded by advisers and political supporters at his resort in Florida, stayed uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter.
832948083	14	With no details released at this point, it’s not known whether Mueller’s report answers the core questions of his investigation: Did Trump’s campaign collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of the celebrity businessman?
832948083	15	Also, did Trump take steps later, including by firing his FBI director, to obstruct the probe?
832948083	16	But the delivery of the report does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, or of obstruction by the president.
832948083	17	A Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments.
832948083	18	That person, who described the document as “comprehensive,” was not authorized to discuss the probe and asked for anonymity.

832948083	22	That’s good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
832948083	23	They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller’s prosecutors.
832948083	24	It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mueller might have referred additional investigations to the Justice Department.
832948083	25	All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies.
832948083	26	Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the Internet.
832948083	27	Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
832948083	28	It’s unclear what steps Mueller might take if he uncovered what he believes to be criminal wrongdoing by Trump, in light of Justice Department legal opinions that have held that sitting presidents may not be indicted.
832948083	29	In his letter to lawmakers, Barr noted the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to ensure there was no political inference.
832948083	30	Trump was never interviewed in person, but submitted answers to questions in writing.
832948083	31	The mere delivery of the confidential findings set off swift, full-throated demands from Democrats for full release of Mueller’s report and the supporting evidence collected during the sweeping probe.
832948083	32	As Mueller’s probe has wound down, Democrats have increasingly shifted their focus to their own investigations, ensuring the special counsel’s would not be the last word on the matter.
832948083	33	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it “imperative” to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
832948083	34	“The American people have a right to the truth,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
832948083	35	Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a “sneak preview” of the findings.
832948083	36	“The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,” they said in a joint statement.
832948083	37	It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller’s findings.
832948083	38	Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying “we look forward to the process taking its course.” But Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get “an early look” before they were made public.
832948083	39	Giuliani said it was “appropriate” for the White House to be able “to review matters of executive privilege.” He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
832948083	40	He later softened his stance, saying the decision was “up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.”
832948083	41	The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report’s arrival Friday.
832948083	42	Barr’s chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
832948083	44	The chairman of the Senate panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was keynote speaker Friday night at a Palm Beach County GOP dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.
832948083	45	Early in the evening, the president appeared on a balcony to wave at the crowd of more than 600 enjoying cocktails and appetizers by the pool, according to party vice-chairwoman Tami Donnally, who attended the event.
832948083	46	Barr has said he wants to make as much public as possible, but any efforts to withhold details is sure to prompt a tussle between the Justice Department and lawmakers who may subpoena Mueller and his investigators to testify before Congress.
832948083	47	Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, threatened a subpoena Friday.
832948083	48	Such a move would likely be vigorously contested by the Trump administration.
832948083	49	The conclusion of Mueller’s investigation does not remove legal peril for the president .
832948083	50	Trump faces a separate Justice Department investigation in New York into hush money payments during the campaign to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election.
832948083	51	He’s also been implicated in a potential campaign finance violation by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the transactions.
832948083	52	Federal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions made to the president’s inaugural committee.
832948083	53	No matter the findings in Mueller’s report, the investigation has already illuminated Russia’s assault on the American political system, painted the Trump campaign as eager to exploit the release of hacked Democratic emails and exposed lies by Trump aides aimed at covering up their Russia-related contacts.
832948083	54	The special counsel brought a sweeping indictment accusing Russian military intelligence officers of hacking Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other Democratic groups during the 2016 campaign.
832948083	55	He charged another group of Russians with carrying out a large-scale social media disinformation campaign against the American political process that also sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.
832948083	56	Mueller also initiated the investigation into Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, who pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations arising from the hush money payments and in the Mueller probe to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal.
832948083	57	Another Trump confidant, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails ultimately released by WikiLeaks.
832948083	58	Mueller has also been investigating whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation.
832948083	59	Since the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017, Trump has increasingly tried to undermine the probe by calling it a “witch hunt” and repeatedly proclaiming there was “NO COLLUSION” with Russia.
832948083	60	But one week before Mueller’s appointment, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, later saying he was thinking of “this Russia thing” at the time.
832956618	1	Mueller Is Done, but the Trump Investigations Are Just Heating Up
832956618	3	The Russia investigation is over.
832956618	4	Or is it?
832956618	5	Attorney General William Barr has notified Congress that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has “concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,” as required under Justice Department regulations.
832956618	6	Mueller has submitted to Barr a confidential report of “prosecution or declination decisions he has reached,” and Barr has promised to review the report and advise Congress of Mueller’s “principal conclusions” as soon as this weekend.
832956618	7	Barr further stated that he would determine whether other information can be released to Congress and the public, committing to “as much transparency as possible.”
832956618	8	So what comes next?
832956618	9	It appears that Mueller and a small staff will close up shop in the near future.
832956618	10	But that does not mean that the investigation into President Donald Trump is over.
832956618	11	Depending on the contents of Mueller’s report, Congress may have some work to do.
832956618	12	Mueller’s original mandate required him to comply with all policies of the Justice Department.
832956618	13	It seems likely, then, that he would adhere to the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
832956618	14	If so, then even if Mueller found evidence of conspiracy between Trump and Russia to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of elections (sometimes referred to as “collusion”), he would refrain from filing an indictment, and instead provide his findings to members of Congress for them to consider whether impeachment is appropriate.
832956618	15	If that is the case, then Congress’s work will just be beginning.
832956618	16	Other prosecutors may also have more work to do.
832956618	17	During the course of his investigation, Mueller has kept a narrow focus on his own mission and farmed out related cases to at least four U.S. Attorney’s Offices.
832956618	18	Those investigations remain ongoing.
832956618	19	It is possible that Mueller has handed off additional investigations in which charges have not yet been filed, and so would be unknown to the public.
832956618	20	For example, the investigation of fraud and campaign finance violations against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed off to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
832956618	21	Cohen pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to three years in prison, but it appears that work on that case continues.
832956618	22	Earlier this week, a judge approved the release of redacted search warrants in the Cohen case, permitting prosecutors to keep more than 18 pages of text from public disclosure.
832956618	23	The redacted pages appeared under the heading “Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme.” The court stated that redaction was necessary because “disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.” This language suggests that the work of SDNY is far from over.
832956618	24	Subjects of the investigation could include Donald Trump, Jr., who reportedly signed at least one of the checks that were provided to Cohen as reimbursement for his illegal payments to silence woman from publicly accusing Trump of extramarital affairs .
832956618	25	Reports have indicated that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, has received immunity in exchange for his cooperation.
832956618	26	Even if Mueller’s work is done, the work of the SDNY continues.
832956618	27	In addition to SDNY, other U.S. Attorney’s Offices are also known to be working on matters that arose from Mueller’s work.
832956618	28	In December, the Eastern District of Virginia charged two associates of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with conspiring to act as agents of a foreign government and related charges.
832956618	29	In that case, Flynn’s former business partner Bijan Kian and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim were charged with agreeing to lobby U.S. officials and influence public opinion against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
832956618	30	The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is handling the pending case against Roger Stone for lying to Congress, making false statements and tampering with witnesses.
832956618	31	That case is set for trial in November.
832956618	32	If Stone should decide to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others, prosecutors would follow those leads as well.
832956618	33	In addition, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Columbia has been handling cases against Sam Patten and Maria Butina , respectively .
832956618	34	Patten pleaded guilty in August to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and has agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others.
832956618	35	Patten pleaded guilty to lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party and concealing his role from the U.S. government.
832956618	36	Patten further pleaded guilty to illegally using straw purchasers to buy tickets to the Trump inauguration for a Ukrainian oligarch for $50,000.TThe law prohibits inaugural committees from accepting money from foreign nationals.Butina pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to act as an agent of Russia.She has been cooperating with the government.
832956618	37	In February, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of South Dakota indicted her boyfriend, Republican operative Paul Erickson, on wire fraud and money laundering charges.
832956618	38	These cases will continue, as will any cases that they spawn.
832956618	39	It may be a long time before the work of Mueller is really complete.
832959523	1	How Theresa May Botched
832959523	3	Those were the times…
832959523	4	The Times page 1 is of January 18, 2017.
832959523	5	Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union about Brexit were just beginning.
832959523	6	The “you’ll be crushed” arrogance in the headline characterizes the attitude the British government under May demonstrated during the talks.
832959523	7	Recently that attitude has somewhat changed.
832959523	8	This screenshot was taken about an hour ago:
832959523	9	The BBC writes: Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $12.99 Buy New $9.05 (as of 10:25 EDT - Details)
832959523	10	Theresa May has said she “sincerely hopes” the UK will leave the EU with a deal and she is still “working on” ensuring Parliament’s agreement.Arriving in Brussels, she said that she had “personal regret” over her request to delay Brexit, but said it will allow time for MPs to make a “final choice”.
832959523	11	At the EU summit the PM spoke to the other 27 leaders to try to get their backing for a delay beyond 29 March.
832959523	12	Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were “very constructive”.
832959523	13	BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 90 minutes and was asked several times what her contingency plans were if she lost the third “meaningful vote” on her deal in Parliament.
832959523	14	French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that if MPs vote down Mrs May’s EU withdrawal agreement next week, the UK will leave without a deal.
832959523	15	May asked the EU to move the hard coded March 29 Brexit date to June 30.
832959523	16	She may be given May 23, the day of EU elections, as a compromise but only if her deal passes the British parliament.
832959523	17	A no-deal crash out on March 29 would create utter chaos for months.
832959523	18	It would be catastrophic for Britain’s economy.
832959523	19	May’s withdrawal agreement was already voted down twice.
832959523	20	If it comes to a third vote in parliament it is very likely to fail again.
832959523	21	Yves Smith, who you should all read, opens her Brexit sit rep today with this:
832959523	22	We’ve been more pessimistic than most commentators about the likelihood of the UK escaping the default of a no-deal Brexit.
832959523	23	We may not have been pessimistic enough.
832959523	24	There is still the possibility that May takes a 180 degree turn, but that would be the end of her career and likely also the end of the Conservative Party:
832959523	25	Now there is a popular push for an Article 50 revocation, with a petition already at over 400,000 signatures as of this hour.
832959523	26	But as we’ll discuss, May would have to do a complete reversal to revoke Article 50, which is within her power, not just a Prime Minister, but also implementing the motion by Parliament rejecting a no-deal Brexit.
832959523	27	Article 50 is the part of the British withdrawal law that governs the Brexit process.
832959523	28	If May revokes it, there is little chance that another Brexit attempt will ever be made.
832959523	29	The majority that voted to leave the EU will have been betrayed.
832959523	30	An analysis by the BBC Europe editor says that the “Leaders want to avoid no-deal Brexit”:
832959523	31	[W]hile EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the “backstop” text, you can bet they’ll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today.
832959523	32	This is, in my view, a misjudgment.
832959523	33	Yes, under normal circumstances and with a competent and trustworthy negotiation partner on the British side, ways would be found to fudge the issue and to avoid a Brexit in all but its name.
832959523	34	That is why I predicted long ago that Brexit was not gonna happen.
832959523	35	But May has really done everything to affront the other side of the table.
832959523	36	She did not stick to commitments she had given, delivered papers too late to properly discuss them, and came to emergency summits called on her behalf without anything new to offer.
832959523	37	Matthew Parris, a conservative political commentator in London who originally favored May, now remarks of her: Battlefield America: T... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $10.78 Buy New $19.06 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details)
832959523	38	“She is mean.
832959523	39	She is rude.
832959523	40	She is cruel.
832959523	41	She is stupid.
832959523	42	I have heard that from almost everyone who has dealt with her,” Parris says.
832959523	43	He said he had never expected this much hatred, “and that is not a word I use lightly.”
832959523	44	The leaders of other EU countries also have had it with here.
832959523	45	The voters on the continent do not care about Britain.
832959523	46	There will be no punishment for Merkel or Macron for letting Britain crash out.
832959523	47	The EU will survive without the United Kingdom.
832959523	48	With a no-deal Brexit the United Kingdom is likely to fall apart.
832959523	49	Within a few years North Ireland would join the Irish Republic, peacefully one hopes, and Scotland would vote to leave.
832959523	50	A bit of hope may still rest in this one line in the BBC report which it leaves unexplained:
832959523	51	Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were “very constructive”.
832959523	52	Is there a EU deal being made with the opposition leader and behind Theresa May’s back?
832959523	53	Given that she is the Prime Minister how would that work out?

832971448	3	The details of the long-awaited Mueller report have not been made public
832971448	4	Special counsel Robert Mueller delivered the results of his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, and the internet had a lot to say about it.
832971448	5	The details of the long-awaited Mueller report have not been made public but he has not recommended any new criminal indictments.
832971448	6	Only time will tell whether President Donald Trump will be implicated.
832971448	7	But that didn't stop meme wizards and Twitter comedians from weighing in on this historical moment.
832971448	8	From depictions of Mueller taking a much-deserved vacation, to Marie Kondo expressing joy over how much she loves a good mess, and so many jokes about procrastinating leading up to deadline, the internet was quick to poke fun on how the investigation continues to play out.

832971448	17	One meme by Twitter user @CoffeeNTrees showed Mueller's face behind cartoon sunglasses, edited onto the body former President Barach Obama on a boat wearing a life vest, from not long after he left office.
832971448	18	'Robert Mueller at 5.15 today,' the post read, implying Mueller immediately went on vacation after turning over his findings to AG Barr.
832971448	19	Another post referenced the cultural phenomenon that has become of Marie Kondo and her Netlix series, 'Tidying Up.'
832971448	20	In the show, Kondo often says she gets excited about the change to help people organize their lives, saying 'I love mess.'
832971448	21	Twitter user '@mattcasill' referenced Kondo's brand showcasing a still of her from the show saying, 'I'm so excited because I love mess,' with the caption, 'tfw [that feeling when] when the mueller report gets delivered.'

832971448	42	Trump has often referred to the Mueller probe as a 'witch hunt' so Takei ran with that.

832984694	1	‘There needs to be a reckoning’ for those who spread Russia collusion narrative: Mollie Hemingway
832984694	3	Those who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.
832984694	4	Earlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.
832984694	5	During Friday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier," Hemingway -- along with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.
832984694	6	MUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
832984694	7	Hemingway began by noting that the “Russia narrative” predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was a “Russian agent.”
832984694	8	“We have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,” Hemingway told the panel.
832984694	9	“The fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we’ve seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was ‘treasonous collusion’ to steal the 2016 election.”
832984694	10	“If there is nothing there that matches what we’ve heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,” she added.
832984694	11	"The people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government ... and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable."

832984694	14	Mason told the panel that there’s likely “some relief” in the White House, particularly from Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser.
832984694	15	And while he insisted it was “too early” to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller’s credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.
832984694	16	Meanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the “greatest anticlimax in American history,” and that the entire investigation could be “for nothing” because it was “an investigation without a crime.” He did, however, insist that the “battle will continue” as the White House will fight Congress on transparency of the Mueller findings.
833013834	1	Cable viewers digest Mueller news through Hannity, Maddow
833013834	3	For Sean Hannity, the 'witch hunt' was finally over.
833013834	4	Rachel Maddow considered it the start of something.
833013834	5	The diametrically opposed opinion hosts, who vie for the distinction of the most popular in cable news, were the windows through which many Americans digested Friday's news that special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded a nearly two-year investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election.
833013834	6	While his report, or even a summary, has not been released, television news still had hours to fill talking about it.
833013834	7	Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe.
833013834	8	Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe
833013834	9	'The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead,' Hannity said.
833013834	10	'It is buried, and there was no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.
833013834	11	The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges.'
833013834	12	He lamented that lives were ruined by the investigation and said that people who have been prosecuted or convicted had committed 'process crimes,' or crimes such as lying to investigators that stem from the very existence of the investigation.
833013834	13	The accusations against Trump were 'what we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate.'
833013834	14	Hannity's Fox colleague Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' between President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government, the purported impetus for the probe.
833013834	15	'This investigation was always, from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country.
833013834	16	They told us that for years,' Carlson said.
833013834	17	Carlson played a highlight reel of Democrats and pundits on other channels previously predicting imminent indictments of Trump and his family members.
833013834	18	None were indicted and Mueller reportedly doesn't recommend any further prosecutions.
833013834	19	'This has been a disaster.
833013834	20	How can we let the people who are responsible for it continue as if it never happened?'
833013834	21	he said, calling for the resignation of top Democrats who have pushed the collusion narrative.
833013834	22	Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' with Russia, the purported impetus for the probe
833013834	23	While Carlson suggested it was a night Americans 'should be celebrating the great news' that no crime was apparently found regarding collusion, Hannity said citizens should be outraged by the amount of time and money spent on the case.
833013834	24	He promised a reckoning in the coming weeks of politicians and media figures he claimed were guilty of a rush to judgment, and his first target was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Investigations Committee.
833013834	25	'Schifty Schiff' read the words onscreen behind him.
833013834	26	'What is Maddow and all the other MSNBC conspiracy theorists, what are they going to ever do now?'
833013834	27	he said.
833013834	28	As he talked, Maddow was doing the same.
833013834	29	Unlike most evenings, when the two figures work in studios across Manhattan's Sixth Avenue from each other, Maddow had rushed to a studio in Tennessee where she had spent the day trout fishing.
833013834	30	'Finally, it happened,' she said.
833013834	31	'In terms of what that means and what Mueller has found, we know only the smallest little bits.
833013834	32	This is the start of something, not the end of something.'
833013834	33	In meticulous fashion, she detailed how the news that Mueller's investigation had concluded was reported and what a letter by Attorney General William Barr meant about what will be released to the public.
833013834	34	Rachel Maddow waited until 16 minutes into her program to discuss the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe
833013834	35	Democrats in Congress have already demanded the full report be released and that they see background materials; Maddow read a letter by Schiff about that on the air.
833013834	36	'Right now we mostly have just a ton of questions, as to what Mueller's report says, who gets to see it, who gets to decide who gets to see it and when,' she said.
833013834	37	It wasn't until 16 minutes into her program that she discussed the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe.
833013834	38	Many Fox News Channel guests, not just Hannity, focused on that detail on Friday evening.
833013834	39	Former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski called it 'a very clear signal that this entire hoax is over.'
833013834	40	Still, some Fox personalities, including Chris Wallace and Harris Faulkner, had to caution guests that Mueller's report hadn't been seen yet.
833013834	41	'To say that somehow this clears the president seems like the height of rushing to judgment,' Wallace said.
833013834	42	He dismissed the idea that those prosecuted had been charged with process crimes, saying they were very serious.
833013834	43	Meanwhile, on CNN, analyst and frequent Trump critic Jeffrey Toobin had an answer to colleagues who warned Trump and his supporters against prematurely celebrating.
833013834	44	While he isn't necessarily in the clear, the fact that the president's sons or son-in-law Jared Kushner were not indicted 'is unambiguously good news for him,' Toobin said.
833018464	1	Do critics of Mueller owe him an apology now?
833018464	3	So, if Mueller in effect clears Trump, I expect to see a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was a dirty cop, deep state, witch hunter to suddenly discover Mueller’s integrity.
833018464	4	And a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was the Last Honest Man to vilify him as a cover up artist.
833018464	5	I don't think so.
833018464	6	The Left will not turn on him because he has made criminal referrals to the Southern District of New York, upon which the Left now pins its hopes.They also hope for the Report to indicate some dirt on Trump for which he cannot be indicted while in office, but which he may have to face after he leaves the presidency..
833018464	7	And as for conservative critics of Mueller, I will speak for myself.
833018464	8	First of all, he should never have hired Andrew Weissmann to be his lead investigator, who, it has been suggested by many, was the actual boss of the investigation, as Mueller withdrew from active, day-to-day management.
833018464	9	Weissmann had disgraced himself in the prosecution of Arthur Anderson's work for Enron, where the guilty verdicts were thrown out by the Supreme Court, after that firm had been utterly destroyed, costing thousands of people their jobs and the partners their fortunes.Second, the prosecutors included no Republican donors but many Hillary donors, and the team initially included Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose fanatic hatred for Trump, disdain for his supporters, and determination to act as an "insurance policy" in case he was elected, should have disqualified them.
833018464	10	A prosecutor interested in the truth should not assemble such a lopsided crew of fanatics..
833018464	11	Third, once it became clear that the Steele dossier — the very basis for the appointment of Mueller — was a Hillary-generated oppo research fantasy, Mueller should have announced that he would not pursue what the law calls the "fruit of a poisonous tree," resigned, and disbanded his investigation.
833018464	12	Fourth, so far as we know, though I would be delighted to learn otherwise when the Report is released, Mueller pursued no investigation of Democrats and Hillary for colluding with Russia.
833018464	13	We know that after laundering their money through the law firm of Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, a foreign intelligence agent named Christopher Steele was employed by the Hillary campaign and DNC to collude with Russian intelligence sources and influence our election.
833018464	14	So far as we know, Mueller was not told to investigate only Republicans.Fifth, the aggressive prosecutors ruined many innocent lives with the costs of lawyers, including the destruction of professional careers..
833018464	15	We now know that an abusive threat to prosecute him was made against author Jerome Corsi unless he signed a "confession" he claims was untrue.
833018464	16	Special counsel Robert Mueller's team offered Corsi a proposed plea agreement, which would have required him to admit to one criminal charge with two components: lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.
833018464	17	Corsi refused to sign the plea deal.
833018464	18	He then released drafts of his plea agreement and indictment, went on a media tour slamming Mueller's team, and published a book detailing his experiences with the special counsel.
833018464	19	In the end, Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.
833018464	20	On Friday, Corsi accused Mueller's team of trying to push him to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.
833018464	21	"I went in there to cooperate with them.
833018464	22	They treated me as a criminal," Corsi said.
833018464	23	"I consider this entire investigation to be fraudulent," he said.
833018464	24	"I'm glad it's over."
833018464	25	Because Corsi was never prosecuted, we know that this was a false threat, that there was no substantial case.
833018464	26	Had Dr. Corsi (he is a Harvard Ph.D. in history) possessed fewer resources (including especially guts), he might well have lied and given the false evidence demanded in order to spare himself the ordeal of prosecution before a District of Columbia jury composed overwhelmingly of Hillary voters, cognizant that federal prosecutors obtain guilty verdicts about 98% of the time.
833018464	27	I do commend Robert Mueller and his team for not faking enough evidence to obtain a phony indictment, but I still hold them responsible for the five types of abuses I just outlined.
833021113	1	Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi celebrates end of Mueller probe after REFUSING to sign plea deal
833021113	3	Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi has said that the end of special counsel Robert Mueller' investigation is a personal vindication, after he refused to take a plea deal under threat of prosecution.
833021113	4	With a senior Justice Department official saying that Mueller's final report submitted on Friday does not recommend further indictments, author and conspiracy theorist Corsi appears to be off the hook.
833021113	5	'I feel vindicated.
833021113	6	They offered me a plea deal which I thought was fraudulent,' Corsi said in a statement to Fox News.
833021113	7	In November, Corsi said he had refused to plead guilty to one count of perjury because he did not believe that he had committed any crime.
833021113	8	Author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi (seen in January) said that he was vindicated by the end of the Mueller probe after refusing to take a plea deal
833021113	9	'I did not knowingly and willfully give them information I knew was false,' Corsi said on Friday.
833021113	10	'The fact is I wasn't going to lie to keep myself out of prison.
833021113	11	I did nothing wrong and it is clear I did nothing wrong or they would have prosecuted me.'
833021113	12	Corsi celebrated the news in a series of triumphant tweets, writing: 'It's over but it has been the worst seven months of my life.
833021113	13	MUELLER IS DONE.
833021113	14	I am in the clear.'
833021113	15	'I want to thank all of you who have prayed for me and my family,' he added, attributing his legal outcome to the power of prayer.
833021113	16	Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, about WikiLeaks publishing stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign.
833021113	17	Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Rodger Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, who is seen above earlier this month
833021113	18	Court documents indicate that Stone sought to use him as an intermediary to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the election.
833021113	19	Stone was arrested in January in a pre-dawn raid on his home in Florida, and is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
833021113	20	He is currently free on bond and has pleaded not guilty on all counts.
833021113	21	Mueller's probe ended without any Americans being charged with conspiring with the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 election, the central allegation of the nearly two-year investigation.

833024133	3	Appearing November 5th, 2017, on MSNBC, former Gov.
833024133	4	Howard Dean (D-VT) wrongly predicted special counsel Robert Mueller would indict President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner for money laundering as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.
833024133	5	“[W]e believe we may well have a criminal in the White House,” Howard Dean told host Keir Simmons.“Certainly, he has a special interest in the Trump family and their investments.
833024133	6	And we think there is substantial likelihood that he has laundered money.
833024133	7	That’s what his associates have been charged with.
833024133	8	And so, this is a very serious matter.I don’t think this about politics, actually.”
833024133	9	Dean described Mueller as a “straight shooter” and then predicted that he would target Kushner after indicting former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his son Michael Flynn Jr.“The next step is going to be the Trump family itself,” Dean continued.
833024133	10	“I expect that there’s a good likelihood Jared Kushner will be indicted for money laundering.
833024133	11	And then we’re going to have to see how far the Russian involvement goes.
833024133	12	This is serious business.”
833024133	13	These people are undermining our democracy, he added.
833024133	14	And it appears to me what Bob Mueller is investigating is whether the president of the United States engaged with a foreign power in order to get where he got.
833024133	15	That’s a very serious matter for this country.”
833024133	16	On Friday, Mueller delivered his Russia probe report to Attorney General William Barr, who stated he will provide Congressional leaders with his account of the findings as early as the weekend.
833024133	17	A senior Justice Department official said the special counsel will not bring further indictments as part of his probe.
833024696	1	2020 Democrats Demand Mueller Report’s Public Release
833024696	3	2020 Democrat presidential candidates reacted to the Friday delivery of special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election to the Department of Justice, demanding that his findings be released immediately.
833024696	4	What the report says is confidential, however, Attorney General Bill Barr wrote in a letter to Congress that he might be able to summarize its “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend.
833024696	5	There was no indication of whether Trump himself, members of his family or former campaign advisers have been implicated in collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, two of the main focuses of the investigation that has kept a cloud over Trump’s administration since he took office.
833024696	6	Read below a round-up of several 2020 Democrat presidential candidates’ statements on the report’s submission:
833024696	7	Release the Mueller report to the American people.

833024696	35	Further, Barr stated he would consult with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, and Mueller to determine what else from the report can be released to Congress and the public.
833024696	36	“I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,” Barr said.
833024696	37	The filing of Mueller’s report came after weeks of intense speculation over whether Mueller, a former FBI director who has remained invisible while the investigation plodded ahead, would produce any indictments or evidence that would support the impeachment of Trump.A senior Justice Department official told US media Friday that after charging some 34 individuals, including six former Trump associates, Mueller’s team did not foresee recommending any further indictments..
833024696	38	Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his election campaign and Moscow, lashing out at the investigation as an “illegal witch hunt” run by a team of biased investigators.
833024696	39	The White House responded to Friday’s development by saying it welcomes the delivery of the long-awaited report.
833024696	40	“The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr and we look forward to the process taking its course,” Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
833024696	41	“The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”

833028146	1	Schiff on end of Mueller probe: 'We have to find the truth'
833028146	3	Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said about a month ago the "evidence" of Trump collusion with Russia was "in plain sight.
833028146	4	"Chairman Burr must have a different word for it," Schiff told host Dana Bash on "State of the Union," pointing to communications between Russia and Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump aides George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.
833028146	5	"You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence," Schiff said, adding, "There is a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt."
833028146	6	If there's "evidence in plain sight" for Russian collusion, then Mueller is either blind or in cahoots with Trump, because the special counsel isn't indicting anyone else.
833028146	7	But Schiff is nothing if not tenacious.
833028146	8	He is vowing to continue the investigation.
833028146	9	"We will find the truth," he told Wolf Blitzer of CNN.
833028146	10	Today, Schiff and numerous other politicians, pundits, and various left-wing loons are still digging through that manure pile looking for the pony they are certain is there.
833028146	11	It's sort of like Bullwinkle pulling a rabbit out of his hat ("Nuthin up my sleeve...presto!")
833028146	12	"Wrong hat," Adam.
833028680	1	Understanding Mueller: What you need to know about the report on the Russia probe
833028680	3	Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
833028680	4	Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
833028680	5	Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is now complete, and he has now submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr.
833028680	6	But the extent of the probe's impact is not yet known.
833028680	7	Here's a guide to understanding how we got here, and what may come next.
833028680	8	It started May 17, 2017, eight days after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.
833028680	9	Mueller, a former federal prosecutor and director of the FBI, was given a broad mandate: A "full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election ... any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation ... any other matters" within the scope of the special counsel law.
833028680	10	No new indictments are expected, but 34 individuals and three separate companies have been charged.
833028680	11	There have been seven guilty pleas and 99.5 months in prison served.
833028680	12	Those charged include: Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman; Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney; and Michael Flynn, who was briefly National Security Adviser.
833028680	13	Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian companies face 161 total charges as part of Mueller's probe, though it is unlikely they will ever see an American court.
833028680	14	The public may never see all of Mueller's findings — that decision rests with William Barr, the attorney general.
833028680	15	Justice Department guidance says Barr should only submit a "brief notification" containing "an outline of the actions and the reasons for them."
833028680	16	He can choose to make much of Mueller's report public if he deems it in the public interest.
833028680	17	Regardless of what Mueller's report shows, congressional investigations are ongoing.
833028680	18	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, has expanded the parameters of the committee's probe.
833028680	19	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has launched an extensive investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.
833028680	20	In early March, the Judiciary Committee requested documents
833028680	21	The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York has also launched investigations into Mr. Trump and the Trump organization.

833028932	3	The Mueller Report Finally Drops, Dems Prepare List of Demands
833028932	4	It's Friday, that means it is panel time!
833028932	5	Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has submitted a confidential report to US Attorney General William P. Barr, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.
833028932	6	The Justice Department notified Congress late Friday that it had received Mueller's report but did not describe its contents.
833028932	7	Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers in the coming days.
833028932	8	UK Prime Minister Theresa May previously sought agreement by the EU's 27 leaders on a "technical extension" of Article 50, pushing Brexit day back to June 30, in the event that the House of Commons ratifies the withdrawal agreement in its third vote on the deal.
833028932	9	The extra time would be needed to pass the necessary legislation.
833028932	10	May's appeal to the heads of state and government was described by sources as "90 minutes of nothing."
833028932	11	She was unable to offer any answers as to how a no-deal Brexit would be avoided if the deal were rejected again.
833028932	12	The leaders imposed a new Brexit timeline on the prime minister to avoid a possible accidental no-deal scenario next Friday, March 29.
833028932	13	Under the new timeline, Britain will stay a member state until April 12 if the withdrawal agreement is rejected by MPs.
833028932	14	If lawmakers accept the prime minister's Brexit deal, the UK will leave the EU by May 22.
833028932	15	The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can "indicate a way forward" and agrees to hold European elections.
833028932	16	The FBI has reportedly joined a criminal investigation of the certification process for Boeing's 737 Max 8 jets, two of which have crashed since October, killing 346 people.
833028932	17	The Seattle Times first reported that the bureau is assisting federal aviation investigators in a federal grand jury probe based in Washington, DC, looking into the process.
833028932	18	Indonesian airline Garuda said Friday that it's canceling a multi-billion-dollar order for 49 737 Max 8 jets in light of the deadly crashes.
833028932	19	"Our passengers have lost confidence to fly with the Max 8," Garuda spokesperson Ikhsan Rosan told CNN.
833028932	20	The Indonesian carrier ordered 50 of the planes in 2014 for $4.9 billion.
833028932	21	It has taken delivery of one of them but has now sent a letter to Boeing saying it no longer wants to receive the remaining jets on order, Ikhsan said.
833028932	22	Garuda is the first airline to say it's canceling a 737 Max 8 order.
833028932	23	US President Donald Trump on Thursday took more shots at the late Sen. John McCain, despite growing calls from Republicans and veterans groups to stop attacking the Arizona GOP lawmaker who died last year.
833028932	24	In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump called McCain "horrible" for his 2017 vote against a congressional Republican measure to repeal Obamacare and accused him of handing a dossier of explosive claims about Trump's ties to Russia to the FBI for "very evil purposes."
833028932	25	When asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo why he continues to criticize McCain, who died seven months ago after battling brain cancer, Trump claimed he was prompted by the news media.
833028932	26	"I don't talk about it," the president said.
833028932	27	"People ask me the question.
833028932	28	I didn't bring this up.
833028932	29	You just brought it up.
833028932	30	You just asked the question."
833028932	31	Trump renewed his attacks on McCain last weekend in an apparent reaction to a news report about the controversial dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele, not after he was asked about his attitude toward the senator.
833028932	32	He has continued to lash out at McCain over the past several days, telling reporters on Tuesday, "I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be," and then on Wednesday grousing about not receiving a "thank you" for approving funeral arrangement plans for McCain, despite his dislike for the former senator.
833028932	33	McCain was memorialized at Washington's National Cathedral last fall, and Trump was not invited to attend.
833028932	34	Trump authorized a government airplane to transport McCain's remains from Arizona to the nation's capital, but the cathedral said Trump's approval was not needed to host the funeral.
833028932	35	It took New Zealand just six days to announce an immediate plan to change to the nation's gun policy after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week.
833028932	36	On Thursday, a day after the first victims were laid to rest, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used in last week's attack.
833028932	37	Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance in Parliament.
833028932	38	The new law could be in place as soon as April 11.

833032366	1	Mueller Report On President Trump Sent To Attorney General
833032366	3	WASHINGTON, D.C. — The highly anticipated Mueller Report on the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was delivered to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, Barr told lawmakers in a letter.
833032366	4	In the letter, Barr told lawmakers that he was reviewing the report and that he anticipates telling Congress about the conclusion in the report as soon as this weekend.
833032366	5	It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see and Barr said in his Friday letter that he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what information can be released to the public and Congress consistent with the law, the Special Counsel regulations and the DOJ's practices and policies.
833032366	6	President Donald Trump on Friday called the investigation a "witch hunt" and a "hoax."
833032366	7	"So we'll see what happens," Trump told reporters on Friday.
833032366	8	"I know that the Attorney General, highly respected, ultimately will make a decision."
833032366	9	In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the next steps are up to Barr and the administration looks forward to the process taking its course.
833032366	10	"The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report," Sanders said.
833032366	11	The delivery of the report to the Department of Justice means that the nearly two-year inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives has come to a close.
833032366	12	Mueller's inquiry has led to a number of indictments and guilty pleas, including from former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
833032366	13	You can read Barr's full letter to Congress below:
833032366	14	A.G. Barr has confirmed the completion of the Special Counsel investigation.
833032366	15	We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials.
833032366	16	Transparency and the public interest demand nothing less.
833032366	17	The need for public faith in the rule of law must be the priority.

833032367	22	SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANY MORE INDICTMENTS AS PART OF HIS INVESTIGATION, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED FRIDAY EVENING.
833032367	23	A senior Justice Department official announced the development shortly after the special counsel submitted its final report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
833032367	24	Barr will now review the report and write his own report on Mueller’s findings and present them to Congress as soon as this weekend.
833032367	25	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
833032367	26	He also said at no time did the Justice Department prevent Mueller from any actions he sought to make during the course of his investigation.
833032367	27	President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery is that he is “glad it’s over,” reported ABC News.
833032367	28	In a separate statement, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow said:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.
833032367	29	Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”
833032367	30	Following confirmation of the report’s delivery, several top Democrat lawmakers demanded its immediate public release.
833032367	31	Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mueller’s findings “must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
833032367	32	Nothing short of that will suffice.”
833032367	33	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) echoed Warner’s remarks, stating: “It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.”
833032367	34	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the former chair of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement “that we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion.”
833032367	35	“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
833032367	36	Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.
833032367	37	“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries.”
833036176	1	No One Knows What’s in the Mueller Report.
833036176	2	Here’s Why This Republican Is Claiming Vindication Anyway
833036176	4	Attorney General William Barr has not yet sent the conclusions of the Mueller report to Congress, but that didn’t stop some Republicans from claiming vindication.
833036176	5	Although House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has not yet seen the report for himself, he nevertheless commented on reports that Mueller did not recommend any new indictments, claiming that it proves there was no collusion between Trump and Russia.
833036176	6	In truth, Mueller’s investigation has already led to a slew of indictments, guilty pleas or convictions from 34 people and three companies, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, and close ally Roger Stone.
833036176	7	But Scalise and other Trump allies seized on news reported in outlets including the New York Times and the Washington Post that quoted a “senior justice department official” as saying that Mueller’s report recommended no further indictments.

833036176	10	“Like most Americans, I am glad to see that this investigation, which has taken nearly two years and cost tens of millions of dollars, has finally come to a close,” Scalise said in a statement.
833036176	11	“The reports that there will be no new indictments confirm what we’ve known all along: there was never any collusion with Russia.
833036176	12	The only collusion was between Democrats and many in the media who peddled this lie because they continue to refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election.
833036176	13	I am glad Attorney General Barr will now be able to review the report, and I look forward to Congress being fully briefed on its findings, including the cost to taxpayers.”
833036176	14	Even if the Mueller report does not recommend further indictments, that does not mean President Trump and those in his orbit are in the clear.
833036176	15	The former FBI head has already referred several cases to career prosecutors at the Justice Department — and may have made other referrals that aren’t public yet.
833036176	16	The Democrat-controlled House also continues to pursue its own investigation into the President’s alleged ties to Russia.
833036176	17	Furthermore, it is long-standing policy in the Department of Justice that a sitting President cannot be indicted.
833036176	18	Still, news that the report recommends no further indictments was cause célèbre for those close to the President.
833036176	19	“675 days, millions spent, a team of people biased against the President, and NO COLLUSION FOUND,” tweeted Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, in a message retweeted by the the President’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.
833036176	20	North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows also tweeted that “The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel.
833036176	21	If that’s true, it would mean we just completed two years of investigating ‘Russian collusion’ without ONE collusion related indictment.
833036176	22	Not even one.
833036176	23	Why?

833036489	1	Bill Maher says he doesn't need Mueller report to know Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'
833036489	3	Bill Maher has said he doesn't need the Robert Mueller report to know President Donald Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'.
833036489	4	Speaking on his Friday night show the Real Time host said: 'I must say, I don't think it looks good.
833036489	5	No further indictments, which means not Don Jr., even after the "I love it" memo, really?
833036489	6	Not Jared, not Manafort or Stone for working with the Russians.
833036489	7	'Did the Democrats put too must trust in the Mueller report?
833036489	8	Because I don't need the Mueller report to know he's a traitor.
833036489	9	I have a TV.'
833036489	10	Maher was joined by a panel of Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Russia Evelyn Farkas.
833036489	11	After labeling Trump a traitor the audience the clapped in approval.
833036489	12	Swalwell agreed, saying 'yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice'.
833036489	13	Real Time host Bill Maher said Friday night he doesn't need the Robert Mueller report to know President Donald Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'
833036489	14	Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
833036489	15	Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president'
833036489	16	Swalwell said: 'And people are on their way to jail, have gone to jail, there's probably a farming out of other investigations, but yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice.
833036489	17	'But here's what's important is that the public sees the report contemporaneously with the president.
833036489	18	He should not be allowed to edit, he should not be allowed to restrict or sanitize, and Mueller has to come before Congress and tell us its veracity.'
833036489	19	He said they would subpoena Mueller to testify before Congress to make that happen.
833036489	20	Anderson said she was 'glad' that the Mueller report was filed, suggesting that the president had helped to drive down the public's opinion of the special counsel's investigation.
833036489	21	Maher added: 'He knows how to do that - to hammer the same thing every day, month after month after month.
833036489	22	''Mueller's dirty, I'm clean!"
833036489	23	Can you imagine getting people to believe that?'
833036489	24	Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
833036489	25	He delivered a long-awaited report Friday to Attorney General Bill Barr, opening up the possibility that key members of Congress could know its bottom line by the end of the weekend.
833036489	26	President Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president.'

833039623	3	Carload of crazies headed to the White House want to use the visceral hatred foisted upon society by Barack Obama, will pave the way to plunge America the Beautiful into a total Bernie Sanders-Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed Socialist State
833039623	4	Robert Mueller III Rests His Case—Dems NEVER Will
833039623	5	Hounded like a fox, hated at every turn, President Donald Trump is—just as half of America steadfastly believed—innocent of all charges ofRussian collusion for simply winning the 2016 presidential election—a reality of life the loony left still refuse to believe.
833039623	6	The $27-million-plus Robert Mueller III Special Counsel rested its case yesterday with no further indictments coming in a delivery, Fox News-described as being “met with stunned surprise and tears?” on CNN and MSNBC”.
833039623	7	Too bad that President Trump won’t likely get to say, “MY TURN!” Unfortunately, no tears will ever be shed that so many called out by the two-and-a-half-year-long investigation will have to spend the rest of their lives in debt for the legal counsel they were forced to hire for the defence of their lives.It is a true life tragedy that Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, who brought all this human suffering about, will never be held accountable for using a salacious, wholly debunked dirty dossier centred on “golden showers” by prostitutes supposedly brought in to defile a bed once slept in by the sacrosanct Obamas..
833039623	8	The real perps in the made-up-from-whole-cloth world-circulated Russian collusion conspiracy are not just walking away, they’re running away with some of the runners planning new books to keep their debunked conspiracy alive.
833039623	9	Too bad that the perpetrators of the false Russians-stole-the-election conspiracy ruined the reputation of what was once America’s most respected intelligence agency by making some of its top brass an active part if it.
833039623	10	Too bad that the Law of the Land ended up treating Paul Manafort, found guilty of financial crimes—not Russian collusion—as though he were an al Qaeda terrorist, and who to this very day is still held in solitary confinement in prison.
833039623	11	Too bad that President Trump won’t likely get to say, “MY TURN!” being far too busy having to bear the slings and arrows aimed at him, his family and surrogates all because the witch hunt tearing a nation apart, will, in one way or the other, continue to carry on.
833039623	12	Count on, dirt-digging, blackmail-ready Democrats and the media continuing to carry on the Hatefest If anything the last two and a half years has shown is that hatred once unleashed and crazy conduct don’t go away overnight.
833039623	13	The best take I heard on the revelation that the about-to-be-lionized Mueller had packed it in came from Tony Mangan, spokesman for the little guy, an unrecognized minority that still exists.
833039623	14	“Well Whooptidoo, so what?” “I have been chewing nails and spitting rust since this conclusion to the Mueller investigation is being discussed everywhere, on TV, Radio, Newspapers, Internet and probably around the water cooler.
833039623	15	“But nowhere have I heard anyone broach some truth, while some are announcing in a celebratory tone that the Mueller Investigation has concluded and he has announced that there will be no indictments for Russian Collusion, no collusion indictments to obstruct justice etc., etc., etc.
833039623	16	“The whole conspiracy was started based on afalse dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat party, handed over to the FBI who knew it was a concoction headed by a former British spy, carried to the next step by the FBI in order to obtain FISA warrants that would allow them to surveil the Trump campaign, and perform wire taps that were based on an illegal process, and people are saying Mueller is known to be a very ethical investigator, and we are sure he did a thorough job over the last two years, while in fact he could have concluded the investigation in the first two days based on the fact that it originated from a fake dossier.
833039623	17	Since the investigation was motivated by a fake document and suspiciously Illegal Warrants, they still went forward based on NOTHING..
833039623	18	“ Count on, dirt-digging, blackmail-ready Democrats and the media continuing to carry on the Hatefest.
833039623	19	Ear-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left Thanks to Paul Sperry over at Real Clear Investigations, it was revealed only days before delivery of Mueller’s Special Counsel Report that dirty dossier writer, Christopher Steele is still on the payroll, still out there digging in Hillary’s manure pile.
833039623	20	That ought to keep self-serving RINOs like Mitt Romney hiding under their desks straight up through the 2020 election.
833039623	21	In the ear-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left, the masses should never forget how we got from Nov. 8, 2016 to yesterday.
833039623	22	The Establishment refused to believe that life would go on without them—but it did.
833039623	23	They plunged the world into an environment of seething hatred, one in which even school children could be attacked for political reasons.
833039623	24	Those who refuse to believe that life would go on without them also refuse to believe in God’s Will, and will never recognize that it is God Almighty and not politics that rules the world.
833039623	25	The Witch Hunt will continue The Witch Hunt will continue with note-passing debate-fixer Donna Brazile now inside the Fox News Hen House giving full-throated voice to what someone else calls “the car load of crazies” Democrat hopefuls, each one of them hoping to be America’s next president, while the voice of conservatives continues to be mainstream and social media suppressed.
833039623	26	But the picture at least is now crystal clear that the carload of crazies headed to the White House want to use the visceral hatred that was foisted upon society when Barack Obama made it into power, will pave the way to plunge America the Beautiful into a total Bernie Sanders’/ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Socialist State.
833039623	27	Little do they know that at least half the country see what they’re up to as the ongoing Battle of Good Against Evil , or that the narrative that matters most is the one that can be found in the words of a prayer: “As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be”.
833039623	28	Meanwhile, life goes on, and until the Creator calls it a day, always will.

833040400	1	Mueller Report Being Reviewed By A.G. Barr On Saturday
833040400	3	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Attorney General William Barr is reviewing the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, according to CNN.
833040400	4	CNN reported that Barr arrived at the Department of Justice shortly before 10 a.m. on Saturday.
833040400	5	In a letter to lawmakers on Friday when Barr received the report, he said he anticipated telling Congress about the conclusions in the report as soon as this weekend.
833040400	6	President Donald Trump is at his Florida club in Palm Beach for the weekend and will be back in Washington D.C. on Sunday.
833040400	7	SEE ALSO: Democrats Prepared To Subpoena Mueller Report, LA's Schiff Says
833040400	8	It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see.
833040400	9	Democratic lawmakers are calling on the full release of the report to the public.
833040400	10	"Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress," Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuch Schumer, said in a joint statement.
833040400	11	"Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.
833040400	12	"The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.
833040400	13	The American people have a right to the truth.
833040400	14	The watchword is transparency."

833041409	1	Beto O'Rourke says he still believes that Trump conspired with Russia
833041409	3	Candidate for the Democrat presidential nomination Beto O'Rourke has said he still believes that President Donald Trump conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election.
833041409	4	O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory.
833041409	5	'You have a president who in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government, a foreign power, to undermine and influence our elections,' O'Rourke said.
833041409	6	'It is beyond the shadow of a doubt that the president once in office sought to obstruct justice,' he continued.
833041409	7	O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory
833041409	8	His remarks came soon after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his investigative report, which a Justice Department official says indicates he will not file further indictments.
833041409	9	In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
833041409	10	But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
833041409	11	US Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to hand Congress as early as Saturday the key findings of the report.
833041409	12	O'Rourke, seen campaigning on Friday, reiterated his belief in a Russian conspiracy
833041409	13	Trump is seen arriving in Florida on Friday to spend the weekend at Mar-a-lago.
833041409	14	He has not tweeted or spoken publicly since news of the report broke
833041409	15	Chronic tweeter Trump, who was at his Florida residence for the weekend, remained uncommonly silent after spending two years repeatedly labeling Mueller's investigation an illegal witch hunt.
833041409	16	The White House has not received a copy of the report or been briefed on it, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.
833041409	17	'The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,' Sanders said in a statement.
833041409	18	Meanwhile Democrats in Congress, many of who are hoping for evidence to support a presidential impeachment, were pressing hard to ensure its full contents are made public, and not just a summary prepared by the Trump-appointed Justice Department chief.
833042063	1	Chelsea Handler Admits She’s ‘Very Sexually Attracted to Robert Mueller’
833042063	3	Far-left comedienne Chelsea Handler has admitted she is “very sexually attracted” to FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller, just hours after he concluded his investigations into supposed collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
833042063	4	On Friday evening, the Justice Department announced that Mueller had concluded his investigations into the matter and that he would not be recommending any more indictments against Trump or anyone else involved in his campaign.
833042063	5	Yet despite the weight of disappointment felt by the majority on the Hollywood left, Chelsea Handler admitted that her obsession with the 74-year-old prosecutor may have been because she found him sexually attractive.
833042063	6	“If I’m being completely honest, I am very sexually attracted to Robert Mueller,” she wrote on Twitter.
833042063	7	“I know it’s not meant to be, but that doesn’t mean I won’t hang a poster of him above my bed.”
833042063	8	If I’m being completely honest, I am very sexually attracted to Robert Mueller.
833042063	9	I know it’s not meant to be, but that doesn’t mean I won’t hang a poster of him above my bed.
833042063	10	— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 23, 2019
833042063	11	Last month, the failed Netflix talk show host wished Mueller a “Happy Valentines Day,” while expressing hope that he would soon indict the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. on charges of Russian collusion or some financial misdemeanor.
833042063	12	“Happy Valentines Day to Robert Mueller, and for him giving his final rose to DonaldTrump, Jr.,” she wrote.
833042063	13	“That would make this holiday really count.”
833042063	14	Mueller’s final report has not yet been released, although Attorney General William Barr said on Friday that he could reveal its contents as soon as this weekend.
833042063	15	“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr wrote in his letter the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

833050243	1	Mueller Report: 'US Forced EU to Follow Through on Sanctions Without Proof'
833050243	3	Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his report on suspected collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to the attorney general, with the report not recommending any further indictments.
833050243	4	Eurasia Centre senior researcher Earl Rasmussen spoke to Sputnik about the report's implications for Trump and his opponents.
833050243	5	Sputnik: What do we know?
833050243	6	What can we expect?
833050243	7	It looks like Donald Trump won't receive any political damage to his image, because of course the report doesn't recommend any further indictments.
833050243	8	What's your stance?
833050243	9	Earl Rasmussen: Obviously there are certain elements, mostly in the mainstream media that's been stoking this, and certain members on the Hill, in Congress, that were hoping for something, because we heard over and over again that the next bombshell was coming.
833050243	10	But you're correct, there's nothing explosive, and with no new indictments coming out, and really if you look at the indictments that were there, there's nothing related at all to any type of conspiracy or collusion as far as the six people indicted who are US citizens.
833050243	11	And the Russians that are indicted are questionable.
833050243	12	Let's face it, Concord Management tried to file discovery, and now [prosecutors are] trying to block information, saying it's 'classified'.
833050243	13	© AP Photo / Alex Brandon Democrat Leaders Demand White House Not Get Preview of Mueller Report
833050243	14	There's really no evidence, and for Mr. Trump, although he will suffer some political damage, I think for the most part the objective of this whole hoax is not coming to fruition.
833050243	15	Sputnik: For now of course, no one really knows what's in the report, how long it is, how much it actually deals with the president's own actions.
833050243	16	However, a lot of political and perhaps emotional capital was invested in this Mueller probe.
833050243	17	Is this a bit of an anticlimax?
833050243	18	Earl Rasmussen: I think for many it is an anticlimax, absolutely.
833050243	19	There's so much invested here.
833050243	20	Two plus years, millions of dollars, political capital on both sides, and you've got people who have lost their livelihoods.
833050243	21	A lot of the people that were brought in, their names exposed, their reputations were damaged.
833050243	22	We've got the six people that have been charged [for] things that happened ten years ago; some are financially ruined now; some will spend time in jail for lying to Congress or lying to the FBI over minor financial things that may have gone unnoticed without this.
833050243	23	You look at the other side too, and we've got damage to international relations, not just with Russia, where what has occurred is just outrageous, but also Europe.
833050243	24	I mean we forced Europe to follow through on sanctions that there's no evidence for.
833050243	25	They've lost business as a result of that, so I'm sure the Europeans will be quite interested in seeing more and learning more about what's coming out of this as well.
833050243	26	© AP Photo / Evan Vucci Trump Again Supports Idea of Making Mueller’s Russia Probe Report Public
833050243	27	The country is divided.
833050243	28	Talk about political discord – the media here has done a great job doing that.
833050243	29	In a lot of ways we've done a lot of damage to ourselves chasing after something that's not there.
833050243	30	Sputnik: US Attorney General William Barr is going to now summarise the report and decide on how much to share with Congress.
833050243	31	What can we expect?
833050243	32	Earl Rasmussen: Personally I think the whole report should be released to the public at some point in time.
833050243	33	He'll release it to Congress, I think most of it will probably be provided to Congress.
833050243	34	There should be nothing there that they don't already know.
833050243	35	They've been doing their own investigations, have called in their own witnesses, so there really should be no surprises there.
833050243	36	Obviously the parties will probably try to manipulate the report [against the other party] in order to potentially posture for the 2020 presidential elections.

833052347	1	US reacts to end of Mueller probe with relief, skepticism
833052347	3	This undated photo shows Dajah Harris, in Norfolk, Va. Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like the border wall, homelessness, college debt and welfare programs..The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions..
833052347	4	(Ben Finley/Associated Press)
833052347	5	PHILADELPHIA — With the long-awaited special counsel’s investigation finished but its contents still shrouded in mystery, Americans waited for details, yawned with boredom or stayed fixed to their long-cemented positions on President Donald Trump, the man at the probe’s center.
833052347	6	For all the expected splash of Robert Mueller’s report, it arrived with more of a thud, thanks to the secrecy surrounding it.
833052347	7	Few saw reason to think it would sway many opinions in a divided republic.
833052347	8	Helen Jones, a 72-year-old retired English professor in Salt Lake City, Utah, who is Republican but despises Trump, knows whatever comes out, her relatives who strongly back the president won’t budge — just as detractors like her won’t be convinced he isn’t a crook.
833052347	9	She sees no simple end in sight.
833052347	10	“I think it’s just the beginning,” said Jones, a political junkie who called the moment a historic one like Watergate.
833052347	11	“I hope it’s a turning point in the Trump presidency.”
833052347	12	Across ideology, many expressed relief Saturday that the investigation was finally over.
833052347	13	“Now maybe we can move on to better things,” said Bubba Metts, a 61-year-old conservative who is a financial adviser in Lexington, South Carolina.
833052347	14	“Twenty million dollars spent — for nothing.”
833052347	15	Dajah Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.
833052347	16	But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like homelessness, college debt and welfare programs.
833052347	17	The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions.
833052347	18	“I don’t feel that where the country is right now that this is something we should even be discussing,” she said.
833052347	19	Mueller worked in virtual silence as a stream of charges have flowed forth against 37 people and companies.
833052347	20	From the start, with his appointment on May 17, 2017, some have framed his work as a battle of good and evil of biblical proportions.
833052347	21	And on the 675th day, Mueller finished his work, and he rested.
833052347	22	But nothing immediately changed for those who had watched with bated breath.
833052347	23	For Mark Itzen, a 64-year-old social worker from Levittown, Pennsylvania, it was a frustrating reality.
833052347	24	“The most disturbing thing for me is that we don’t know the details,” the Democrat said.
833052347	25	“I thought we have the right to know right off the bat after all this anticipation.”
833052347	26	Expectations remained high for some sort of explosive revelation, but what exactly it might be remained anyone’s guess.
833052347	27	For liberals who welcomed the investigation with gleeful shouts of “It’s Mueller Time!” and anxiously awaited justice that aligns with their view of Trump as Antichrist, it seemed the endless billows of smoke would surely produce evidence of fire.
833052347	28	For conservatives who subscribed to the president’s view of the probe as a witch hunt and dismissed it as the misguided tomfoolery of a bitter opposition whose search for retribution is as loopy as its policies, it seemed certain to bring exoneration to Trump and maybe even a roadmap for future victory by him and his party.
833052347	29	Jason Cox, a 51-year-old farmer in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to again next year, saw it the way Trump framed it — as a witch hunt.
833052347	30	“It didn’t turn out, it seems to me, the way Democrats wanted,” he said.
833052347	31	“I think Pelosi and Schumer are going to just keep beating and badgering and looking for something.”
833052347	32	Stanley Twardy, legal adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law, which worked to protect the Mueller investigation from political interference, said the report won’t bring a quick end to anything.
833052347	33	“It’s not like the report will be issued and everybody says, ‘OK, we’re done now,’” he said.
833052347	34	“This is all part of a process.
833052347	35	The process will work its way out.
833052347	36	This is why our country has stood the test of time.”
833052347	37	Shaela and Cindy Buchanan were tackling chores Saturday morning at the Lost Sock Laundromat in Wichita, Kansas, when the topic of Mueller was raised.
833052347	38	“Which one is Mueller?” asked Cindy, a 51-year-old manager at a paint company.
833052347	39	She doesn’t follow politics closely but liked Trump at first.
833052347	40	The questions about Russia, though, caused the 51-year-old paint company manager to reconsider.
833052347	41	Her 48-year-old wife Shaela, who considers herself a political independent, sees Trump as “bought and paid for” while regular people live paycheck to paycheck.
833052347	42	She doubts Mueller’s report ultimately does anything to change that.
833052347	43	“I don’t feel it is over once it is released,” Shaela Buchanan said.
833052347	44	“People any more they have suffered to the point they don’t have any power — it doesn’t matter.”
833052347	45	Peter Malak, a 42-year-old high school civics teacher from northeastern North Carolina, offered similar thoughts.
833052347	46	He calls himself a swing voter who tends to lean right.
833052347	47	While the media obsess over the Mueller report, he said, most Americans just want to pay their mortgages.
833052347	48	“The average person just doesn’t care,” he said, while stopping for a haircut.
833052347	49	“Your life is going to go on either way, regardless of what the Mueller investigation comes out to be.”

833053628	1	Confident Trump and anxious Washington wait for AG Barr's report on Mueller's key findings
833053628	3	Justice Department sources tell Fox News that Attorney General William Barr is working to quickly release the primary conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded Russia investigation.
833053628	4	That information, however, wasn't expected to emerge on Saturday.
833053628	5	For Washington insiders, the waiting game isn't easy.
833053628	6	Speculation about the hotly anticipated report's contents has been rampant.
833053628	7	Still, in a show of confidence, President Trump waved and flashed two thumbs up to supporters as he returned to his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.
833053628	8	The president's demeanor signaled the administration's strong belief that Mueller's long-awaited final report contained good news.
833053628	9	Among other things, the special counsel is not recommending any further indictments as part of his inquiry, which effectively ended Friday, according to a senior Justice Department official.
833053628	10	Further, Mueller did not charge any Americans with illegally conspiring with Russians on any matter, including election interference -- a foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago.
833053628	11	Even as Trump remained in Florida, Barr was working "hand in hand" on Saturday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in reviewing the Mueller report at the DOJ, the senior official said.
833053628	12	Fox News is told that Barr may run the conclusions past White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Emmett Flood, who were in Mar-a-Lago, before they are released -- but that Trump's personal attorneys are unlikely to be notified.
833053628	13	It will likely take longer for the facts supporting the conclusions to come out, Fox News is told, because there may be materials that are either classified, or subject to executive privilege in the factual material.

833053628	15	Barr notified key congressional leaders in a letter Friday evening that Mueller finished his investigation, adding that a summary of the probe’s findings may be provided to lawmakers as soon as this weekend.
833053628	16	Fox News has also confirmed that House Democrats, meanwhile, began a conference call at approximately 3:10 p.m.E.T.
833053628	17	Saturday with “chairs of relevant committees” discussing next steps regarding the Mueller report and messaging.
833053628	18	New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will host as Caucus Chair, and attendees will include Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, as well as Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters.
833053628	19	At the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for a public release of the Mueller report, and said she would reject any classified briefing of the report's findings to lawmakers.
833053628	20	Any briefing must be unclassified so that members of Congress can talk about it publicly, Pelosi said.
833053628	21	Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Saturday: "It’s the end of the beginning.
833053628	22	But it’s not the beginning of the end."
833053628	23	He added: "We’re spending the weekend in anticipation of what Attorney General Barr may share with Congress," and cautioned that Democrats were "concerned executive privilege could be asserted broadly here" to hide the report's key findings.
833053628	24	In a Saturday conference call, Coons also issued a warning for his fellow Democrats, many of whom have pinned astronomical political hopes on Mueller's findings: "Once we get the principal conclusions of the report, I think it's entirely possible that that will be a good day for the president and his core supporters."
833053628	25	CHAFFETZ: HYPOCRITICAL DEMS SUDDENLY CARE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY
833053628	26	Some advocacy groups have made clear they aren't keen on waiting.
833053628	27	A nonprofit organization on Friday night filed the first known Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking the immediate and total public disclosure of Mueller's completed report and all related documents, echoing bipartisan calls for transparency following his nearly two-year probe into whether the Trump campaign illegally colluded with Russia.
833053628	28	The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) wrote in an emergency complaint filed in a Washington, D.C., federal district court that the "public has a right to know the full scope of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and whether the president of the United States played any role in such interference."
833053628	29	The delivery of the Mueller report, which a DOJ official called "comprehensive," does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia or of obstruction by the president.
833053628	30	That's good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
833053628	31	They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller's prosecutors.
833053628	32	Still, some key details remain unanswered, EPIC said, prompting its litigation.
833053628	33	House Democrats, meanwhile, have somewhat downplayed the Mueller probe and suggested that the left-leaning lawmakers themselves might take on the job of trying to prove collusion, not ruling out the possibility of Mueller being asked or subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees.

833053628	35	“If the Justice Department doesn't release the whole report or tries to keep parts of it secret, we will certainly subpoena the parts of the report and we will reserve the right to call Mueller to testify before the committee or to subpoena him,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
833053628	36	While the Mueller probe’s conclusions are not yet known, the investigation already has led to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for nearly three dozen people and three companies.
833053628	37	All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; and three Russian companies.
833053628	38	Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet.
833053628	39	Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
833053628	40	OPINION: WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD REJECT THE MUELLER REPORT
833053628	41	Despite all that prosecutorial activity, though, Americans were not implicated in criminally colluding with Russia to influence the election.
833053628	42	In a series of posts on Twitter on Friday, journalist Glenn Greenwald -- who also called for the release of the Mueller report -- repeatedly emphasized that point, and condemned pundits for hyping the Mueller report irresponsibly for nearly two years.
833053628	43	"It's truly fascinating to watch Dems grapple with the fact that Mueller finished his work without indicting a single American for conspiring with Russia over the election: everything from "nobody has read his report!"
833053628	44	(irrelevant to that fact) to 'sealed indictments!'
833053628	45	(unhinged)."
833053628	46	Greenwald wrote.
833053628	47	In another post, he criticized media outlets for promoting the anti-Trump rhetoric of partisan commentators like ex-CIA Director John Brennan -- an Obama appointee whose security clearance was revoked last year because, the Trump administration said, he was using it to lend credence to political attacks.
833053628	48	"You can't blame MSNBC viewers for being confused," Greenwald continued.
833053628	49	"They largely kept dissenters from their Trump/Russia spy tale off the air for 2 years.
833053628	50	As recently as 2 weeks ago, they had @JohnBrennan strongly suggesting Mueller would indict Trump family members on collusion as his last act.
833053628	51	... Oh gosh - turns out that if you hire ex-CIA Directors to be 'news analysts,' they'll abuse our airwaves to disseminate self-serving disinformation."
833053628	52	He concluded: "How - if you're an MSNBC viewer (or consumer of similar online content) - can you not be angry & disoriented having been fed utter [bulls--t] like this for 2 straight years with basically no dissent allowed?
833053628	53	Just listen to what they were telling you to believe & how false it was."

833053628	55	Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it "imperative" to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
833053628	56	"The American people have a right to the truth," Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
833053628	57	Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a "sneak preview" of the findings.
833053628	58	"The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public," they said in a joint statement.
833053628	59	It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller's findings.
833053628	60	Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying, "We look forward to the process taking its course."
833053628	61	But Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get "an early look" before they were made public.
833053628	62	Giuliani said it was "appropriate" for the White House to be able "to review matters of executive privilege."
833053628	63	He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
833053628	64	He later softened his stance, saying the decision was "up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly."
833053628	65	The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report's arrival Friday.
833053628	66	Barr's chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
833053628	67	Fox News' Ed Henry, Mike Emanuel, Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

833053676	3	Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) offered his thoughts on the completion of Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which was submitted to Attorney General William Barr a day earlier.
833053676	4	Lewis insisted Congress will demand the report be released to the public.
833053676	5	The Georgia Democrat also said he still believed President Donald Trump’s impeachment was still inevitable.
833053676	6	“I think that day will come,” Lewis said when asked by Reid about impeachment prospects.
833053676	7	“I don’t think he’s legitimate.
833053676	8	I said it back at the end of the election.
833053676	9	I still believe that today.”

833067493	1	Don Trump Jr uses Maury Povich paternity meme to mock Democrats
833067493	3	Donald Trump Jr has used a Maury Povich meme to mock Democrats over the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
833067493	4	'Democrats, the test results are back, and Donald Trump is your daddy,' read the text on the image Trump Jr posted on Instagram Saturday, a day after Mueller filed his final report.
833067493	5	Trump Jr added in a comment: '... and your president,' along with three laughing emojis.
833067493	6	The image depicted Povich, whose long running daytime talk show often features startling revelations about love triangles and cheating spouses.
833067493	7	Trump Jr posted the above meme to his Instagram account on Saturday
833067493	8	Trump Jr (seen last year) mocked Democrats saying that the 'test results' show that President Donald Trump is their 'daddy'
833067493	9	It came as President Donald Trump's supporters trumpeted reports that Mueller will seek no additional prosecutions, despite months of feverish predictions that Trump Jr or other close Trump associates would be the next to face indictment.
833067493	10	In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
833067493	11	But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
833067493	12	Attorney General William Barr is now expected to deliver his summary of Mueller's findings to Congress no sooner than Sunday.
833067493	13	MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was disheartened at the news that Mueller would not seek further indictments.
833067493	14	She is seen above interview Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff
833067493	15	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement that Barr's offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report's conclusions is insufficient and that 'Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents.'
833067493	16	Senator Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump and his core team could still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes.
833067493	17	Trump's business, his charity and his presidential transition operation remain under investigation, Coons said, and congressional Democrats would keep looking into his activities.
833067493	18	'It's the end of the beginning, but it's not the beginning of the end,' Coons told reporters on a telephone conference.
