820791520,"George III Lost America.

Theresa May Could Lose the United Kingdom Over Brexit.

Britain is locked in the most serious peacetime crisis in its modern history, the increasingly desperate attempt to secure the nation’s orderly departure from the European Union.
Brexit has shown the world a British parliament and a political class that resembles a ship of fools without a captain.
One veteran of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet said that voters are looking at parliament “with something rather near to contempt.”
We speak of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the Western world.
Since 1721 it has seen 74 prime ministers of highly varied competence and backgrounds but few if any as incapable of steering the country through perilous times as the current incumbent, Theresa May, who could end up being compared to George III because of the consequences of her ineptitude.
The ultimate test of a prime minister in a crisis is always the same—how well do they measure up to the moment?
The answer to that depends on a combination of skills.
Quite often they are skills that politicians do not find in themselves until they are called upon by destiny to prove them.
Different times need different abilities.
Sometimes a prime minister who at the time seems mediocre is later reassessed and seen to have been more consequential than anyone realized because he was overshadowed by a predecessor.
In British history there is a classic instance of this: In 1945 Winston Churchill was rudely and unexpectedly removed from office in a general election and replaced by the leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee.
Churchill, the country’s greatest ever war leader, was contemptuous of his successor whom he described as “a modest little man with a lot to be modest about.”
It turned out that Attlee (who was deputy prime minister during the war) was precisely what the nation needed, not only to get through years of austerity imposed by the near-bankruptcy created by the war effort, but as the parliamentary leader with the skills to re-engineer British society and provide its people with a comprehensive safety net including, notably, free universal health care for life.
So here were two men equally indispensable in their abilities, one to lead and the other to heal.
In each case their mastery reflected their character, Churchill who was able to project himself as the living embodiment of a great national narrative of obdurate resistance and victory and Attlee as the quiet but systematic architect of change.
And today Britain has Theresa May.
It is too generous to say that May has had trouble measuring up the to moment.
She has trouble explaining what the moment actually is—the utterance that will forever be her epitaph in the history of political discourse will be “Brexit means Brexit.”
Imagine Churchill saying “war means war.” OK, let’s be reasonable.
When it comes to oratory nobody can hold a candle to Churchill.
Every prime minister since Churchill has carefully avoided getting into that kind of contest.
But when the qualities of leadership are under scrutiny it’s important to understand that Churchill was as courageously decisive in private as he was in public.
There is a passage in Andrew Roberts’ sweeping new biography, Churchill, Walking With Destiny, describing a moment where the prime minister speaks ad lib and without leaving his own record of what was, literally, one of the statements that saved Britain.
He was speaking to men not as resolved as himself who needed to believe in him as an army needs to believe in its generals.
It came in the early summer of 1940 when Churchill, who had taken over only a week before, was resisting attempts to negotiate with Hitler.
He told his new cabinet: 
“I have thought carefully in these last days whether it was part of my duty to consider entering into negotiations with That Man.
But it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out.
The Germans would demand our fleet—that would be called ‘disarmament’—our naval bases and much else.
We should become a slave state… If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.”
No official minute was taken of that statement—Roberts quotes it as recorded later in the diary of a cabinet member.
What is new now is that Theresa May brings to the office a background like no other before her.
She is the first person to hold that office who is by both experience and instincts a bureaucrat.
Her rise to the Tory party leadership owed much to her success as a bureaucrat.
She ran a government department that was so large and so challenging to master that some prime ministers were known to have deliberately given it to rivals in order to destroy their careers: the Home Office, a Whitehall edifice that could perhaps be compared to a nightmare package embracing the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Homeland Security.
She was put there by David Cameron, a prime minister who was himself notoriously bored by administrative details and, as his decision to hold a national referendum on Brexit demonstrated, not too smart at judging outcomes.
May survived with a mixed record at the Home Office.
She acquired something of the reputation of a control freak, devoted to organizational charts and preferring to run the department through a small and tight-knit clique of loyal aides and Tory Party law-and-order zealots.
Churchill, famous for asking for opinions “on one half sheet of notepaper,” said that a camel is what you end up with if you ask a committee to design a horse.
May was fond of setting up committees and official inquiries to avoid taking action and produced many camels.
One of her former cabinet ministers despaired that “it’s a fantastic skill, her ability to do nothing.”
“ Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
”
Later she managed to swat away responsibility for an ugly debacle during her watch.
West Indians who immigrated to Britain in the 1950s were threatened with mass deportation because they had no record of legally arriving—then it turned out that the Home Office itself had discarded the documentation.On the face of it her bureaucratic cast of mind should have been an asset when facing the complexities involved in negotiating Britain out of all the political, legal and commercial attachments to the European Union.
After all, the country was not facing a lethal existential threat.
This was a self-initiated unraveling of laws and treaties.
But the EU is the world’s largest assembly of bureaucrats, a characteristic often damned by the pro-Brexit campaign, as well as by more reasoned critics.
A negotiation of this complexity had never been attempted by anyone before.
It needed a team that combined a complete command of administrative detail, a shrewd sense of the national interest, an equally shrewd assessment of the opposing interests, and an ability to understand the difference between bottom-line economic interests and the EU’s loftier moral values as an alliance committed to protecting constitutional democracy in a continent with an unhappy history of autocracies.
This was a tough deal for anyone to successfully achieve.
But any leader who was able not only to pull it off but to sell it to their people—in the case of the UK to a people divided by a referendum margin as close as 52 to 48 percent—needed to have something else.
They had to be able to bring eloquence and vision to their argument.
Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat’s particular gift of killing language.
The English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.
The closest she has ever come to articulating the case for the Brexit deal she negotiated that set up a 21-month transition period for achieving a new free trade agreement with the EU (the deal that she is again stuck with trying to amend and resuscitate despite that fact that the EU has warned it will not renegotiate) was to say, repetitively, “It is in the national interest for everyone to get behind it.”
Basically when the narrow majority of Brits voted for Brexit they voted for something that didn’t actually exist.
There was not even the vaguest outline of the real impact that Brexit would have on British life.
Its proponents, even if they had any sense of the outcome (which is doubtful) weren’t interested in pesky details.
They were appealing to raw emotions, largely anti-immigrant xenophobia, not advancing a rational argument.
The Brexit deal that May presented to parliament went down in the biggest defeat any prime minister has suffered, 432 votes to 202.
All along she had been trying to reconcile elements that are not reconcilable: keeping the support of her party’s lunatic fringe that is undismayed by the prospect of a “no deal” exit that would bring extreme self-harm while also holding the loyalty of the center of the party—and doing this while satisfying the terms the EU is prepared to allow.
(“Allow” is the realistic term because Britain has always been a supplicant.)At the same time she survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote that leaves her in power while seriously wounded and without a new deal that is likely to fly.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, is similarly ineffectual and unready to meet the leadership tests of his time.
His party includes a rump of Brexiters and his cabinet is in thrall to fossilized Marxist ideas.
His rhetorical skills are, if anything, less evident than May’s.
Given two clueless party leaders it often seems that all the politicians are overcome by the kind of helpless rapture that sent Thelma and Louise driving blissfully over the cliff.
In 1940 Churchill’s freedom of action was greatly helped by the fact that he did not have to bow to any party’s dictates.
He was appointed prime minister without being leader of the Tory party—the leader remained his predecessor as prime minister, Neville Chamberlain.
Uniquely, Churchill led a coalition of the Tory, Labour and Liberal parties at a time when none of those parties would probably have accepted him as their party leader.
As a result of this freedom he was able to isolate and negate the influence of the appeasers who did not like the prospect of choking in their own blood.
He could and did appeal directly to the spirit of a parliament and a people who set aside partisan interests in favor of a higher purpose, victory that was by no means assured.
The irony now is that Brexiters represent only 15 percent of the 650 members of the House of Commons.
A large majority is opposed to Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal.
A prime minister not constrained by party loyalties could easily get support for a “soft” Brexit—meaning a measured transition from full membership to one that keeps the country in a permanent customs union without disruption.
Instead, by trying vainly to satisfy everyone May is satisfying nobody except people like the loony Little Englanders who say that such a deal would leave Britain as a “slave state.”
If they get their way May could well go down in history as the prime minister who lost the kingdom—the United Kingdom.
Scotland wants nothing to do with Brexit and if it is imposed on them the Scottish parliament will probably vote to end the Acts of Union of 1707 that created the United Kingdom in order to leave them free to join the EU.
The implications are wider than that.
Leaders in the European Union—including Germany’s Angela Merkel—are now fretting that the EU without Britain will be less able to clamp down on the kind of populist taste for autocrats that is afflicting Poland and Hungary.
George III went down in history as the king who lost America.
Nobody in particular was held culpable for losing the empire—that was an inevitability of history that imposed its own logic and timing.
If the United Kingdom becomes Little England (albeit including Wales and Northern Ireland) it will have reverted to the boundaries of the land it was in 40 A.D. when the Romans made a coherent colony out of a rabble of warring tribes.
And this fiasco will be owned by a parliament that allowed a deranged minority to win and a prime minister who was never remotely equal to the greatest challenge of her time.

828866387,"Brexit in 23 days: EU says still 'no solution'

(DW.COM) – Just over three weeks before the UK walks out of the European Union, there has been no breakthrough to amend Britain’s divorce deal.
The deadlock between the EU and Britain is centered on the so-called Irish backstop.
The European Union said Wednesday there has been no progress in the latest talks with Britain, just days before the UK lawmakers are set for a second vote to avoid a hard Brexit.
EU diplomats led by negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterparts met in Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to amend their divorce deal before Britain’s scheduled exit on March 29.

“Michel Barnier has informed…that while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere, discussions have been difficult,” said Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive.
“No solution has been identified at this point that is consistent with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will not be reopened,” Schinas said.

813552066,"You insult us, ambassador: Woody Johnson flagrantly abused special relationship, says PETER OBORNE

With three months until Britain leaves the European Union, Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through Parliament.
Next week, MPs will reassemble at Westminster — and the following week, they will vote on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.
If they vote it down, Britain will be plunged into the greatest constitutional crisis in more than 100 years.
Mrs May might even resign and a new prime minister take over.
The stakes could not be higher.
U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit
Into this national crisis of epic proportions has just waded the clodhopping U.S. ambassador to Britain, billionaire Robert Wood ‘Woody’ Johnson.
On Monday, Mr Johnson foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May’s premiership.
He informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain ‘was in need of leadership’ over Brexit.
Lethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain’s closest ally and strategic partner — with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II.
This brutal attack by Donald Trump’s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her — and Britain’s — future.
All the more so since he held out the carrot of a ‘quick, very massive bilateral trade deal’ .
.
.
if Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement collapses.
U.S. President Donald Trump waves next to U.S.
Ambassador to U.K. Woody Johnson as he leaves the latter's residence in London
Notorious
Furthermore, Mr Johnson’s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James’s.
The first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics.
Least of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest.
By implication, Mr Johnson has lumped Theresa May with all the ‘losers’ whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account.
There is no defence of Mr Johnson’s conduct.
And no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement.
Mr Johnson, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy.
This must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party.
Having first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush’s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run.
The switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism.
But then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as Johnson to important ambassadorial jobs.
Take Lana Marks, the President’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
She is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities.
In common with an embarrassing number of Trump’s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump’s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members’ resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website.
Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump’s presidential campaign.
Everything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump.
And, in December, Trump’s administration put forward as America’s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy.
Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals
Ambassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump’s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers.
In truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions.
Some of the greatest men in American history — including five future presidents — served as U.S. ambassador to London.
Woody Johnson cannot be classed in their company.
This scion of the industrial company Johnson & Johnson — famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo — is not even second-division.
Outcry
Twelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm’s involvement in tax avoidance schemes.
Johnson said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful.
However, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest.
In Britain, such a record could have debarred Johnson from further involvement in public life.
And the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry.
But then, it’s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody Johnson did with Mrs May on New Year’s Eve.
Of course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House.
Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President
He might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump’s America.
Or on the progress of Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President.
Squirming
He could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President.
Above all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
I should point out that Mr Johnson did say that Britain’s future was ‘extremely positive, extremely bright’.
But that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister.
Professional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician — Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP.
I can’t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage — and then passes on his wisdom to Woody Johnson.
So when Trump’s crony Johnson turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage.
The fact is that Johnson is out of his depth.
Like his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S.
If the President won’t rein him in — and I’m not holding my breath — Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act.
And if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.

821040551,"Queen Elizabeth Would Be Evacuated in Event of Brexit Riots: Report

If Britain leaves the European Union without a trade deal, and riots ensue, Queen Elizabeth will be evacuated from London, according to reports.
Many British people are reportedly worried that there won’t be a deal when the U.K.leaves the EU in less than 55 days and, as a result, have been busy stockpiling medication and food.
A new report has also emerged that the 92-year-old monarch has a contingency plan, underscoring the severity of the situation, The New York Times reported.
The Sunday Times additionally reported that evacuation plans for the royal family had long been in place.
A Cabinet Office staffer, who was not identified in the report, told the newspaper: “These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War, but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit.” Buckingham Palace declined to address evacuation plans on Sunday, with a spokeswoman saying, “We’re not commenting on that at all.”

817176202,"The British People, as Well as the Politicians, Don’t Want Brexit

The British Parliament just handed Prime Minister Theresa May one of the biggest legislative defeats in parliamentary history, by rejecting her Brexit plan.
These House of Commons politicians may simply be following the will of the British people, who now reject the idea of leaving the European Union only a few years after narrowly approving the plan in a referendum.
May should either call for a new referendum, or resign, if she cares about British democracy.
Europe Cut Off?
The British people have always had some ambivalence about joining the European Union.
It’s more about being independent than being anti-European.
This was best illustrated by a story my political science professor told me years ago.
After a violent storm in the English Channel, telecommunications between the island and the mainland were severed.
The headlines in Europe read “Terrible Storm: England Cut Off.” The United Kingdom newspapers touted the headlines, “Terrible Storm: Europe Cut Off.”
Polls going back to February of 2012 confirm this.
Opposition to the EU in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was much stronger, with 45 percent wanting to leave the EU and only 35 percent wanting to remain, with 20 percent unsure and the remainder saying they would not vote.
Opponents of the EU largely led the polling landscape from 2012 to 2015.
Subscribe to Observer’s Politics Newsletter
From 2015 to 2016, there was a seesaw battle between proponents of Brexit and opponents, who wanted to stay in the EU.
It seemed to change from survey to survey.
The supporters of leaving the EU narrowly won out, largely due to wild claims from Brexit supporters, like the UK Independence Party (UKIP), that the country would make a lot of money by leaving the EU.
In addition, support for Brexit was also fueled by opposition to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a free market champion and EU supporter who became pretty unpopular quickly due to a series of scandals, and his policies that struggled to help the UK recover from the Great Recession.
I went into a Conservative Party club in 2012 in Oxford and could barely find a Cameron supporter in his own party’s get-together.
I found just a tiny photo of him that had been moved to the back of the building.
Support for the EU Rises
But something happened after the Brexit vote.
Polls show that the number of undecided votes dropped precipitously, and support for the EU rose.
As people realized that voting for Brexit wasn’t like winning the lottery, and that the country was due to face a lot of economic pain for breaking with the European Union, support for Brexit slipped in the polls.
Additional polls consistently show that those favoring the EU would win a new referendum, as people realize the consequences of Brexit, as well as the false promises such a plan won’t deliver.
May, who assumed power after Cameron resigned, sought to capitalize on the Brexit vote by calling for early elections.
Instead, this Brexit cheerleader was humiliated at the polls, and her party lost its majority in power, relying on a Northern Ireland party to cling to power.
May sought to negotiate the Brexit plan with the EU.
But the plan was so unpopular in 2018 that she tabled it, hoping the House of Commons would like it better in 2019.
They liked it less, leading to May’s Waterloo in the vote.
Not since Tory Prime Minister Lord North received the news from Yorktown about the success of the American Revolution has a British politician been so humiliated.
Time for Another Vote
Failing to learn the lessons of her defeat, May refused to call for a new referendum, calling such a move “antidemocratic.” But what’s more antidemocratic: giving the people a new vote and a second chance, or leaving her tiny parliamentary coalition in charge of making the policy.
When it comes to democracy, to paraphrase from the film The Princess Bride, I would say “You keep using that word.
I do not think that words means what you think it means.”
Former Labor PM Tony Blair, and former Conservative PM John Major, have called for a new vote, showing a rare moment of bipartisanship.
Polls estimate that at least 55 percent of the British people want to stay.
It’s time to have a fake news-free referendum that doesn’t involve racism or the stabbing death of a parliamentarian who opposed Brexit.
Let the British determine their own fate before the end of March, and let’s not leave it up to a lame duck prime minister who doesn’t seem to command a quarter of the House of Commons.

820419869,"No break from Brexit: RT takes a look at latest developments, as MPs told ‘no holiday for you’

As British MPs are told that their February break from parliament is to be cancelled in order to solve the chaos currently enveloping Britain, RT takes a look at the latest goings-on in the EU divorce saga.
On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.
Over two and a half years after that vote, the British people are no clearer as to how the country will leave the bloc it's been a member of since 1973.
So, where are we at with less than 60 days to go until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29?

Theresa May and her government
The British prime minister won the backing of UK MPs in parliament on Tuesday after the ‘Brady’ amendment, backed by her government, was voted through, in what was seen as a major victory by many of her supporters.
The amendment instructed May to renegotiate her Brexit deal with the EU and secure the necessary changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
Without finding “alternative arrangements” that the EU will agree to, the PM will find it difficult to push through her deal at a second attempt in two weeks' time.
She's expected to travel to Brussels for talks in the next few days.
On Wednesday, Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that compromises would have to be made on the backstop by the EU otherwise it would lead to a no-deal – meaning the UK would not hand over any of the £39 billion divorce bill money.
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, indicated on Thursday that Brexit could be delayed to secure a deal with the EU and claimed proposals to solve the Irish border issue will be devised over the coming days.
The EU
The bloc has remained united in their stance regarding opening up the EU Withdrawal agreement.
A variety of EU officials and representatives from member states have stated that they will not renegotiate the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed in November 2018 and will not contemplate removing the Irish backstop as it would threaten Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement.A spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk, issued a firm statement on Tuesday evening in the aftermath of May receiving the backing of UK parliament to renegotiate her deal, saying that the “Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.””
Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, insisted on Wednesday that the backstop must remain.
His Brexit Steering Group stated “…the withdrawal agreement is fair and cannot be re-negotiated.”
The Republic of Ireland's Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday that his country would not accept wishful thinking as an alternative to the backstop.
Coveney insisted: “We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty…”
Hardline Brexiteers
The European Research Group (ERG), seen as the highly influential Brexiteer faction of the Tory Party, supported May's government on a variety of amendments on Tuesday evening, including the Brady Brexit proposal.
However, the harmony between these hardline Brexiteers and May's cabinet has not lasted very long.
Former Brexit minister Steve Baker accused the PM of making a “stupid mistake” by excluding the ERG's favored civil servant, Crawford Falconer, to carry out renegotiations with the EU.
Olly Robbins, who currently leads the UK's civil service on Brexit negotiations, is seen as too pro-EU for the ERG's liking.
People's vote
MPs and activists campaigning for a second referendum have taken a severe hit to the momentum they seemed to have built over the last few months.
Their chances of securing a people's vote have been significantly reduced after MPs decided to vote against Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment that would have seen Brexit delayed past March 29.
Without an extension of Article 50, there cannot be enough time put aside to secure the necessary legislation for a second referendum.
Labour
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party suffered a setback on Tuesday during votes on Brexit amendments.
They lost on the Cooper and Brady amenmendents as well as their own proposal to give MPs options to back Labour's Brexit plans and a second referendum.
Some party activists have called for Labour MPs who voted with May's government on key amendments on Tuesday to be deselected.
Corbyn met May on Wednesday for discussions on Brexit, in a bid to find a cross-party consensus that can garner the support of a majority of MPs.
He described talks as “a useful exchange of views” and asked the PM to consider a permanent customs union with the EU to break the impasse.

833052347,"US reacts to end of Mueller probe with relief, skepticism

This undated photo shows Dajah Harris, in Norfolk, Va. Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like the border wall, homelessness, college debt and welfare programs..The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions..
(Ben Finley/Associated Press)
PHILADELPHIA — With the long-awaited special counsel’s investigation finished but its contents still shrouded in mystery, Americans waited for details, yawned with boredom or stayed fixed to their long-cemented positions on President Donald Trump, the man at the probe’s center.
For all the expected splash of Robert Mueller’s report, it arrived with more of a thud, thanks to the secrecy surrounding it.
Few saw reason to think it would sway many opinions in a divided republic.
Helen Jones, a 72-year-old retired English professor in Salt Lake City, Utah, who is Republican but despises Trump, knows whatever comes out, her relatives who strongly back the president won’t budge — just as detractors like her won’t be convinced he isn’t a crook.
She sees no simple end in sight.
“I think it’s just the beginning,” said Jones, a political junkie who called the moment a historic one like Watergate.
“I hope it’s a turning point in the Trump presidency.”
Across ideology, many expressed relief Saturday that the investigation was finally over.
“Now maybe we can move on to better things,” said Bubba Metts, a 61-year-old conservative who is a financial adviser in Lexington, South Carolina.
“Twenty million dollars spent — for nothing.”
Dajah Harris, 21, a college senior at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is a Democrat and no fan of Trump.
But she saw the investigation as a distraction from more important things like homelessness, college debt and welfare programs.
The country should never have elected someone, she said, whose background raises such questions.
“I don’t feel that where the country is right now that this is something we should even be discussing,” she said.
Mueller worked in virtual silence as a stream of charges have flowed forth against 37 people and companies.
From the start, with his appointment on May 17, 2017, some have framed his work as a battle of good and evil of biblical proportions.
And on the 675th day, Mueller finished his work, and he rested.
But nothing immediately changed for those who had watched with bated breath.
For Mark Itzen, a 64-year-old social worker from Levittown, Pennsylvania, it was a frustrating reality.
“The most disturbing thing for me is that we don’t know the details,” the Democrat said.
“I thought we have the right to know right off the bat after all this anticipation.”
Expectations remained high for some sort of explosive revelation, but what exactly it might be remained anyone’s guess.
For liberals who welcomed the investigation with gleeful shouts of “It’s Mueller Time!” and anxiously awaited justice that aligns with their view of Trump as Antichrist, it seemed the endless billows of smoke would surely produce evidence of fire.
For conservatives who subscribed to the president’s view of the probe as a witch hunt and dismissed it as the misguided tomfoolery of a bitter opposition whose search for retribution is as loopy as its policies, it seemed certain to bring exoneration to Trump and maybe even a roadmap for future victory by him and his party.
Jason Cox, a 51-year-old farmer in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to again next year, saw it the way Trump framed it — as a witch hunt.
“It didn’t turn out, it seems to me, the way Democrats wanted,” he said.
“I think Pelosi and Schumer are going to just keep beating and badgering and looking for something.”
Stanley Twardy, legal adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law, which worked to protect the Mueller investigation from political interference, said the report won’t bring a quick end to anything.
“It’s not like the report will be issued and everybody says, ‘OK, we’re done now,’” he said.
“This is all part of a process.
The process will work its way out.
This is why our country has stood the test of time.”
Shaela and Cindy Buchanan were tackling chores Saturday morning at the Lost Sock Laundromat in Wichita, Kansas, when the topic of Mueller was raised.
“Which one is Mueller?” asked Cindy, a 51-year-old manager at a paint company.
She doesn’t follow politics closely but liked Trump at first.
The questions about Russia, though, caused the 51-year-old paint company manager to reconsider.
Her 48-year-old wife Shaela, who considers herself a political independent, sees Trump as “bought and paid for” while regular people live paycheck to paycheck.
She doubts Mueller’s report ultimately does anything to change that.
“I don’t feel it is over once it is released,” Shaela Buchanan said.
“People any more they have suffered to the point they don’t have any power — it doesn’t matter.”
Peter Malak, a 42-year-old high school civics teacher from northeastern North Carolina, offered similar thoughts.
He calls himself a swing voter who tends to lean right.
While the media obsess over the Mueller report, he said, most Americans just want to pay their mortgages.
“The average person just doesn’t care,” he said, while stopping for a haircut.
“Your life is going to go on either way, regardless of what the Mueller investigation comes out to be.”

832918490,"Adam Schiff Threatens to Subpoena Mueller After Russia Probe Wraps

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that his panel will subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if more details regarding his report on possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia is required.
“If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee,” Schiff told CNN host Wolf Blitzer, adding that the House Judiciary Committee could request Attorney General Bill Barr testify on the report’s findings, as well.
Mueller delivered his report to Barr on Friday and said that he could brief Congressional leaders on its findings as early as this weekend.
Schiff continued:
At the end of the day, the (Justice) department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
And it’s hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
This began as a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI.
It began as the same in our committee, and we have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.
The California Democrat made no mention whether Mueller’s possible testimony would be public or closed-door.

813494037,"Sadiq Khan Slammed for Pro-EU 'Message of Support' During Firework Display

The spectacular fireworks that lit up the London sky on Monday night caused a stir on social media over the display's pro-EU message, at a time when the nation is divided over its looming withdrawal from the bloc.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced mounting criticism after the capital's New Year's Eve fireworks display, which celebrated ties with the European Union, left a bad taste in the mouths of some Brits.
The 135-metre-high London Eye was lit up in blue while its tubs turned yellow, with the giant Ferris wheel resembling the star-studded flag of the European Union.Sadiq Khan called his fireworks display a ""message of support"" to EU citizens living in London.
""Our one million EU citizens are Londoners, they make a huge contribution, and no matter the outcome of Brexit — they will always be welcome"", he said.
To the one million EU citizens who have made our city your home: you are Londoners, you make a huge contribution and you are welcome here.
I'm proud that tonight we will welcome in the new year with a message of support to you.
#LondonNYE #LondonIsOpen https://t.co/XctrgfXXaM — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) 31 декабря 2018 г.
However, a host of Londoners rushed to Twitter to accuse their mayor of ""politicising"" the celebrations — with some are even calling for his resignation.
I cannot believe this event has been politicised.
This man has no shame.
Just resign.
— wayne campbell (@campbs177) 31 декабря 2018 г.
Thanks a lot Sadiq Khan you ruined the fireworks display by talking about Europe, need I remind you about Brexit.
You have started of the new year by talking about relationships with the European Union.
Well done.

The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 via a nationwide referendum, with 51.9 per cent voting in favour of pulling out of the bloc, while 48.1 per cent wanted to remain.
The withdrawal is scheduled for the end of March; the Article 50 deadline.
The Remain sentiment dominated London, with nearly 60 percent of voters wanting Britain to stay in the European Union.
Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Remainer himself, earlier called for a second referendum on Brexit.
""The government's abject failure — and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a 'no deal' Brexit — means that giving people a fresh say is now the right — and only — approach left for our country,"" he said in September.

Lewis insisted Congress will demand the report be released to the public.
The Georgia Democrat also said he still believed President Donald Trump’s impeachment was still inevitable.
“I think that day will come,” Lewis said when asked by Reid about impeachment prospects.
“I don’t think he’s legitimate.

815412286,"Ex-MI6 chief says Theresa May’s Brexit deal ‘threatens national security,’ hurts US relationship

A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security “in foreign hands.”
The letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May’s controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as “our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA” and urges MPs to vote against the deal.
BRITISH PM THERESA SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens,” the letter says.
“The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.”
The deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May’s Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged.
The so-called “backstop” to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U.
permanently.
Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U.
“a veto over our ability to exit.”
Dearlove and Guthrie say that the deal “threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships.” According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is “the exact opposition of the people’s instruction to take back control” when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.
In response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs “is completely wrong.”
SPAIN AGREES TO BACK BREXIT DEAL AFTER SECURING CONCESSIONS FROM BRITAIN, EU
The letter is the latest blow to May’s push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.
She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.
Should she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament.
That could, in turn, lead to a general election.
Those who have opposed Brexit have renewed calls for either a second referendum or a delay in Britain’s departure.
May did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the “whole world” wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.

May told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:
""The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U.
has made clear is the only deal,” she said, before calling it a “good” deal.

832984694,"‘There needs to be a reckoning’ for those who spread Russia collusion narrative: Mollie Hemingway

Those who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.
Earlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.
During Friday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" Hemingway -- along with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.
MUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
Hemingway began by noting that the “Russia narrative” predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was a “Russian agent.”
“We have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,” Hemingway told the panel.
“The fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we’ve seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was ‘treasonous collusion’ to steal the 2016 election.”
“If there is nothing there that matches what we’ve heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,” she added.
""The people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government ... and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable.""
— Mollie Hemingway, senior editor, the Federalist

Mason told the panel that there’s likely “some relief” in the White House, particularly from Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser.
And while he insisted it was “too early” to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller’s credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.
Meanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the “greatest anticlimax in American history,” and that the entire investigation could be “for nothing” because it was “an investigation without a crime.” He did, however, insist that the “battle will continue” as the White House will fight Congress on transparency of the Mueller findings.

830821478,"Britain Begs the EU for a Brexit Deadline Extension to Work Out What it Actually Wants

Britain will beg the European Union for a delay to its EU withdrawal to give a desperate Theresa May more time to find a way out her Brexit mess.
In a series of votes Thursday, members of parliament [MPs] voted to instruct May to go back to the EU to request a new Brexit deadline.
The British government wants to extend the current deadline for three months if May’s hated Brexit deal is approved by March 29.
If she can’t get that through parliament, there could be a much longer delay.
Britain can’t decide to extend the Brexit deadline by itself, however.
That will require the approval of each member state of the EU which is by no means guaranteed unless May can give them good reason to allow her more time for to work on a deal many consider to be dead.
If British lawmakers don’t approve May’s deal by March 29, and an extension isn’t approved by the EU, then the country is still set to crash out of the bloc without a deal in 15 days.
Earlier in the day, the government revealed it intended to hold a third vote on May’s deal some time next week.
If it completes a trilogy of defeats, MPs will then get to vote on a range of options to indicate exactly how they want to proceed without May’s deal and without leaving with no deal.
However, changing course would cause a much longer Brexit delay which the government warned could cause “real damage to the public's faith” in politics.
A British government minister told The Daily Beast that the prime minister will now begin what amounts to a bribery campaign in which she’ll throw money at members of parliament for their pet projects to win their backing for her deal by the end of the new propsed deadline.
“I suspect the big HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] chequebook is about to be dusted off and promissory notes to fall like confetti,” said the minister
The government also hopes the threat of a much longer delay will force the hand of the anti-EU MPs who voted against her deal—believing it would keep the U.K. too closely entwined with Europe—and bring them into line in a potentially-decisive third vote to make sure Brexit happens.
A spokesman for the European Commission reiterated that a deadline extension would require the “unanimous agreement” of all its member states, and each leader will have to “consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.”
A separate vote Thursday saw lawmakers overwhelmingly reject the idea of a second referendum on independence.
Although it wasn’t a legally-binding vote and doesn’t completely rule out the prospect of another referendum, the number of lawmakers who voted against it indicate it is unlikely to win a majority at any time in the near future.
MPs also rejected the chance to wrestle the Brexit process away from the prime minister by turning down a measure which would have given them control of parliamentary time next week to arrange a series of votes on alternative brexit options.
That measure—rejected by just two votes—would have allowed MPs to find a way forward on Brexit without May’s deal.
That means MPs have this week voted against May’s deal, against leaving the EU with no deal, against holding a second referendum, and against using their power to find an alternative route to get Britain out of the Brexit stalemate it finds itself in.
The decision to delay Brexit came after a week of humiliation for the prime minister—a feeling she must be used to by now.
Lawmakers rejected her deal for a second time on Tuesday night in a defeat which was only marginally better than in January when it suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.
Then, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted against the U.K. ever leaving the EU without a deal.
Although that vote wasn’t legally binding, it was another crushing government defeat which some of her own ministers decided to abstain on.
May’s misery wasn’t helped by Donald Trump on Thursday when he said he was “surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations” and criticized the prime minister because she didn't listen to his advice on Brexit, commenting: “It could have been negotiated in a different manner.” May revealed in July last year that Trump told her, in typical Trump fashion, the best way forward would be to sue the EU.Asked if he thinks the Brexit deadline should be extended, Trump said: “I think they are probably going to have to do something, because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that.”
However, the president warned against a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying it would be “unfair to people who have won.”

833018464,"Do critics of Mueller owe him an apology now?

So, if Mueller in effect clears Trump, I expect to see a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was a dirty cop, deep state, witch hunter to suddenly discover Mueller’s integrity.
And a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was the Last Honest Man to vilify him as a cover up artist.
I don't think so.
The Left will not turn on him because he has made criminal referrals to the Southern District of New York, upon which the Left now pins its hopes.They also hope for the Report to indicate some dirt on Trump for which he cannot be indicted while in office, but which he may have to face after he leaves the presidency..
And as for conservative critics of Mueller, I will speak for myself.
First of all, he should never have hired Andrew Weissmann to be his lead investigator, who, it has been suggested by many, was the actual boss of the investigation, as Mueller withdrew from active, day-to-day management.
Weissmann had disgraced himself in the prosecution of Arthur Anderson's work for Enron, where the guilty verdicts were thrown out by the Supreme Court, after that firm had been utterly destroyed, costing thousands of people their jobs and the partners their fortunes.Second, the prosecutors included no Republican donors but many Hillary donors, and the team initially included Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose fanatic hatred for Trump, disdain for his supporters, and determination to act as an ""insurance policy"" in case he was elected, should have disqualified them.
A prosecutor interested in the truth should not assemble such a lopsided crew of fanatics..
Third, once it became clear that the Steele dossier — the very basis for the appointment of Mueller — was a Hillary-generated oppo research fantasy, Mueller should have announced that he would not pursue what the law calls the ""fruit of a poisonous tree,"" resigned, and disbanded his investigation.
Fourth, so far as we know, though I would be delighted to learn otherwise when the Report is released, Mueller pursued no investigation of Democrats and Hillary for colluding with Russia.
We know that after laundering their money through the law firm of Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, a foreign intelligence agent named Christopher Steele was employed by the Hillary campaign and DNC to collude with Russian intelligence sources and influence our election.
So far as we know, Mueller was not told to investigate only Republicans.Fifth, the aggressive prosecutors ruined many innocent lives with the costs of lawyers, including the destruction of professional careers..
We now know that an abusive threat to prosecute him was made against author Jerome Corsi unless he signed a ""confession"" he claims was untrue.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team offered Corsi a proposed plea agreement, which would have required him to admit to one criminal charge with two components: lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.
Corsi refused to sign the plea deal.
He then released drafts of his plea agreement and indictment, went on a media tour slamming Mueller's team, and published a book detailing his experiences with the special counsel.
In the end, Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.
On Friday, Corsi accused Mueller's team of trying to push him to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.
""I went in there to cooperate with them.
They treated me as a criminal,"" Corsi said.
""I consider this entire investigation to be fraudulent,"" he said.
""I'm glad it's over.""
Because Corsi was never prosecuted, we know that this was a false threat, that there was no substantial case.
Had Dr. Corsi (he is a Harvard Ph.D. in history) possessed fewer resources (including especially guts), he might well have lied and given the false evidence demanded in order to spare himself the ordeal of prosecution before a District of Columbia jury composed overwhelmingly of Hillary voters, cognizant that federal prosecutors obtain guilty verdicts about 98% of the time.
I do commend Robert Mueller and his team for not faking enough evidence to obtain a phony indictment, but I still hold them responsible for the five types of abuses I just outlined.

The EU's antagonistic stance towards Brexit, which was on show again this week, is not motivated by lofty, internationalist ideals, but by financial factors.
Self-interest comes before respecting democratic decisions.
If we don't get the result we want, vote again.
Or else we just ignore it.
Anyone who still believes the EU supports 'democracy' should reflect on this week's events.
On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's so-called 'Withdrawal Agreement' was heavily defeated in the House of Commons, with a large number of Brexiteers voting against it.
On the same day, European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Prime Minister of Poland, tweeted: ""If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?
"".

That's Britain staying in the EU and sticking two fingers up at the 17.4m people, many of them from the most deprived parts of the country, who voted to Leave.
EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker meanwhile urged the UK to ""clarify its intentions as soon as possible"", warning that ""time is almost up.""

It's hard to escape the conclusion that the EU offered Britain such a bad deal because they knew it wouldn't be passed.
Then, maximum pressure could be exerted on theUK to reconsider its decision to leave, or at least kick Brexit into the long grasss, which is what having a second referendum would do.
Right on cue, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the CDU, and the front-runner to become Germany's next chancellor after Angela Merkel, has made an '11th hour' plea for Britain to stay in the EU.
The emotional plea, which lauds ""the legendary British black humour"" among other things, comes, appropriately enough, in a letter to the neocon propaganda organ the Times, which supported 'Remain.'
The European establishment is desperate for Britain to reconsider Brexit.
Internationalist ideals about 'preserving European unity', don't come in to it, this is all about protecting income streams.

Consider a few facts.
If Britain does leave without a deal, then the EU as an institution would be considerably worse offThe UK has consistently been one of the top three countries that puts most into the EU budget (after Germany and France).).
It is one of ten countries that puts more into the EU than it gets out.
In 2017, the UK's net contribution was £9bn.
If Britain leaves, the EU faces a financial shortfall.
In 2016, 16 countries were net receivers, including Donald Tusk's Poland.
Little wonder that he regards Britain staying as ""the only positive solution"".
The very generous financial remuneration packages of EU officials might also be threatened by British withdrawal.
n December, it was reported that the EU's top civil servants would be paid over €20,000 a month for the first time, and that Tusk and Juncker would see their packages rise to €32,700 a month.
Austerity?
Not in Brussels, mon ami!
The EU is a fabulous gravy train once you are on board.
But the gravy train relies on its richest members not leaving, otherwise who's going to foot the bill?
If Britain leaves with 'No Deal', it's not just the EU budget which will take a hit.
In 2017, EU countries sold around £67 billion more in goods and services to the UK, than the UK sold to them.
Europe needs full and unfettered access to British markets, much more than Britain needs full and unfettered access to European markets.

That's not being 'nationalistic', but simply stating the economic reality.
The country that would lose out the most with Brexit is Germany.
Britain's trade deficit with Germany is higher than with any other country, even higher than China, whose products are everywhere in our shops!
In 2016, the year of the EU referendum, Britain imported around £26 billion more from Germany than it exportedIt's no great surprise therefore to see the president of the Federation of German Industries as one of the signatories of the letter to the Times, pleading for Britain to stay!y!
Repeat after me: ""We would miss Britain as part of the European Union.
We would miss Britain as part of the European Union""We also have to discuss fishing.
The other EU countries do extremely well out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides them with access to UK waters.
Belgian fleets get around half their catch from British waters!
As reported in the Independent, the Common Fisheries Quota has for the past 34 years given 84% of the cod in the English Channel to France and just 9% to the UK.
Overall, EU vessels take out around four times as much fish out of UK waters as British vessels take out of EU waters.s.
Again, you don't have to be Albert Einstein to work out why the EU doesn't want Britain to leave.
If the EU's commitment to democracy was genuine, they would have done everything they could to make sure the referendum result of June 2016 was implemented.
But the financial hit of Britain leaving is too high.
So, instead they have done everything possible to subvert the democratic will of the people, while at the same time boasting about their commitment to 'democracy.'
Good news for democracy: Parliament is proposing EUR 1.8 billion funding for a new Rights and Values MFF Programme.
Civil society will be our strongest ally to protect the #RuleOfLaw & fundamental rights across the EU!

Of course, the EU is not the only party to blame.
The British government, led by a Remainer, and with Remainers holding prominent positions in the Cabinet, has been pusillanimous.
Theresa May has shown she is desperate for a 'deal' whereas in fact, the ones who really need an agreement to provide continued unfettered access to lucrative UK markets, are the EU.
If the UK government had called Brussels' bluff and announced that Britain would just leave, you can be sure Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and co would have come running with a much better offer.
Their (very high) salaries, and the profits of European businesses, depend on it.

816460196,"Theresa May faces catastrophic defeat in major Brexit vote as allies warn: ‘Winter is Coming’

Prime Minister Theresa May was facing a significant and potentially catastrophic defeat on a major Brexit vote in Parliament Tuesday, a defeat that could eventually lead to anything from no Brexit at all to a general election -- as May's allies took a page from “Game of Thrones” and ominously warned: “Winter is Coming.”
Parliament will vote later Tuesday on May’s withdrawal agreement with E.U.
leaders, ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March.It is a vote that May is expected to lose heavily, but the severity of the loss is likely to determine the extent to which May is able to go back to Brussels and demand further concessions to try again to get the agreement through Parliament..BRITISH MP DELAYS GIVING BIRTH BY TWO DAYS TO VOTE AGAINST BREXIT DEAL
May has been criticized by both sides of the debate for her handling of the implementation of the 2016 referendum, with Remain supporters accusing her of presiding over chaos, with pro-Brexit factions in her own Conservative Party claiming that she has kowtowed to Brussels and that her deal does not actually lead to Brexit being delivered.
“I’ll be voting against the withdrawal agreement because I don’t believe it delivers Brexit,” Conservative MP and top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on the BBC Tuesday.
The anger from the “Brexiteer” wing focuses primarily on the inclusion of a “backstop” -- a safety net that keeps Britain in a customs union with the E.U.
in case no trade deal is made after March.
It is intended to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but Brexiteers have pointed to the lack of a unilateral exit mechanism as evidence that the backstop will lead to Britain never actually leaving.
If May's agreement loses by more than 100 votes, it would likely renew calls from her own party for her to step down, and give impetus to the opposition Labour Party to put forward a motion of no-confidence -- a move that could eventually lead to a General Election.
A Sky News analysis Tuesday suggested she could lose by as many as 226 votes -- which would be the largest defeat in House of Commons history, and catastrophic for May.
EX-MI6 CHIEF SAYS THERESA MAY'S BREXIT DEAL 'THREATENS NATIONAL SECURITY,' HURTS US RELATIONSHIP
Others who support Britain remaining in the E.U.
have floated the idea of a second referendum, by which Brits would get a do-over on the 2016 referendum -- something May has rejected outright.
That proposal has been condemned by many Brexit supporters as an effort to scrub out the 2016 referendum, what they say is a trend in Europe by which voters are made to vote again and again until they vote the ""right"" way.
In the face of withering criticism, May and her allies have been pushing back, hoping to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum.
May told a packed House of Commons ahead of the vote that ""I believe we have have a duty to deliver on the choices of the British people.""
She also criticized Labour Party calls for a general election.
""At the end of a general election, the choices facing us will not have changed,"" she said.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who is a May supporter and also campaigned for Brexit in 2016, sought to rally Brexiteers to May’s side, using a ""Game of Thrones"" reference to warn that the damage would be significant.
“I think if we don't vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, 'winter is coming,’” he said on BBC's Radio 4, “I think if we don’t for vote the deal tonight, I think we will do damage to our democracy, by saying to people that we are not going to implement Brexit,” he said.
In the Commons on Tuesday, the bombastic Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave a thundering hour-long speech, in which he boomed a defense of the withdrawal agreement and sought to counter arguments against it: “It is what the people voted for and we by adopting this withdrawal agreement, can give it to them.”
Warning about the dangers to Brexit and to the country of voting down May’s deal, Cox asked: “Do we opt for order or do we choose chaos?'
MAY SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS
To his own party, particularly the Brexit wing, he turned to the Tory benches and asked: “What are you playing at?
What are you doing?”
A defeat also makes it unclear of the future for not only May, but also Brexit.
Should the agreement fail, Britain is set to leave without a deal with the E.U., something that Remainers and some business groups have said would lead to chaos from an economic downturn to a lack of access to vital medicines as Britain’s ports clog up.
MAY SLAMS TONY BLAIR'S NEW BREXIT VOTE CALL
Those on the right of the Tory Party have downplayed the risks of no deal, noting that Britain would revert to normal World Trade Organization terms and the benefits of leaving the E.U.
would outweigh any difficulties.
“Cutting the costs of imports from outside the E.U., making our economy more competitive, is going to be extremely beneficial,” Jacob Rees Mogg told the BBC.
“All the gloomsters, the prophets of doom, are the people who prophesied doom before and they’ve been wrong in all their earlier forecasts.”
May's supporters have argued that her way is the only way to avoid no-deal.
In the face of one Labour MP who blasted Attorney General Cox for failing to acknowledge the dangers of “no deal,” Cox shot back: “She can rule out no-deal today, all she has to do is vote for this one.” He then accused the Labour Party of seeking to “drive this government onto the rocks, create the maximum chaos” and pave the way for an election.

May told Parliament that the only way to avoid no deal was the vote for hers, and emphasized the importance of the decision in Britain's history.
""The time has now come for all of us to make a decision, a decision that will define our country for decades to come, a decision that will determine the future for our constituents, for their children and grandchildren, a decision each of us will have to justify and live with for many years to come,"" she said.

833036176,"No One Knows What’s in the Mueller Report.
Here’s Why This Republican Is Claiming Vindication Anyway

Attorney General William Barr has not yet sent the conclusions of the Mueller report to Congress, but that didn’t stop some Republicans from claiming vindication.
Although House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has not yet seen the report for himself, he nevertheless commented on reports that Mueller did not recommend any new indictments, claiming that it proves there was no collusion between Trump and Russia.
In truth, Mueller’s investigation has already led to a slew of indictments, guilty pleas or convictions from 34 people and three companies, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, and close ally Roger Stone.
But Scalise and other Trump allies seized on news reported in outlets including the New York Times and the Washington Post that quoted a “senior justice department official” as saying that Mueller’s report recommended no further indictments.

“Like most Americans, I am glad to see that this investigation, which has taken nearly two years and cost tens of millions of dollars, has finally come to a close,” Scalise said in a statement.
“The reports that there will be no new indictments confirm what we’ve known all along: there was never any collusion with Russia.
The only collusion was between Democrats and many in the media who peddled this lie because they continue to refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election.
I am glad Attorney General Barr will now be able to review the report, and I look forward to Congress being fully briefed on its findings, including the cost to taxpayers.”
Even if the Mueller report does not recommend further indictments, that does not mean President Trump and those in his orbit are in the clear.
The former FBI head has already referred several cases to career prosecutors at the Justice Department — and may have made other referrals that aren’t public yet.
The Democrat-controlled House also continues to pursue its own investigation into the President’s alleged ties to Russia.
Furthermore, it is long-standing policy in the Department of Justice that a sitting President cannot be indicted.
Still, news that the report recommends no further indictments was cause célèbre for those close to the President.
“675 days, millions spent, a team of people biased against the President, and NO COLLUSION FOUND,” tweeted Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, in a message retweeted by the the President’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.
North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows also tweeted that “The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel.
If that’s true, it would mean we just completed two years of investigating ‘Russian collusion’ without ONE collusion related indictment.
Not even one.
Why?
Because there was no collusion.”

Post-Brexit Britain should use its power to defend democracy around the world, Jeremy Hunt will say today.
The Foreign Secretary will insist the UK should not 'underestimate' its strength.
'We are not a superpower and we do not have an empire,' he will say in a speech in Singapore.
'But we do have the fifth-biggest economy in the world, the third-biggest overseas aid budget, the second-biggest military budget in Nato, one of the two biggest financial centres, the world's language, highly effective intelligence services and a world-class diplomatic network.
'We also have immense reserves of soft power, with three of the world's top ten universities, 450,000 international students, 39million visits by tourists in 2017, and a global audience for our media, especially the BBC, measured in the hundreds of millions.'
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit.
He is pictured in Myanmar before Christmas
Mr Hunt will point to Britain's links with the Commonwealth, the United States and Europe, saying: 'Those connections are why Britain's post-Brexit role should be to act as an invisible chain linking together the democracies of the world ... who share our values and support our belief in free trade, the rule of law and open societies.
'We should begin by being realistic about our global position.
That means not overestimating our strength but not underestimating it either.'
Mr Hunt will highlight worrying figures showing that 71 countries saw reversals of political and civil liberties in 2017.
He will sign a 'strategic partnership' with Singapore covering areas including defence and education.

813603860,"Labour activists 'could QUIT the party over Corbyn's Brexit referendum stance'

Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
The research underlined the scale of the challenge Jeremy Corbyn faces from Labour members, with thousands considering quitting, nearly a quarter believing he is a Brexiteer, and nearly three quarters wanting a new referendum
Attending a rail fare protest in central London today, Mr Corbyn again dodged as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists on Brexit
The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said:'Our survey of Labour's grassroots clearly shows that Corbyn's apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labour's members want, and it doesn't reflect the views of most Labour voters either.''
Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, Mr Corbyn said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
'This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.
It's finally going to take place the second week of January.
That is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago.
This Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May's deal.
'Well both of those options are completely unacceptable.'
The work was carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project.
Some 29 per cent of Labour's rank-and-file members said they oppose the stance that the party has taken on Brexit - and 56 per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting.
That proportion would be equivalent to around 88,000 members, according to the project's analysis.
If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some 88 per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, 3 per cent said they would leave with Theresa May's deal and 5 per cent would support leaving with no deal.
If the choice was between the Prime Minister's deal and leaving the EU without an agreement, some 27 per cent of Labour members said they would boycott the vote altogether, although 46 per cent said they would take Mrs May's deal.
Some 89 per cent of Labour members - compared with 65 per cent of current Labour voters and only 45 per cent of all voters - are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.
While just 35 per cent of the electorate as a whole believe that warnings of short-term disruption with potential problems for food and medicine supplies in a no-deal Brexit are realistic, that figure rises to 82 per cent of Labour members and 58 per cent of Labour voters.
Prof Bale said: 'Our survey suggests Labour's membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end.
Theresa May (pictured delivering her New Year message) has been battling to get her Brexit deal through Parliament
'It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party's members on either count, are in the same camp.
'Labour's grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.
'As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour's leader to get off the fence.'
Labour MP Phil Wilson said: 'An overwhelming majority of Labour's voters, as well as its members, want the public to have the final say on Brexit and to stay in the European Union.
'But the leadership has too often hidden behind myths that Labour is almost evenly divided on this issue when the clear evidence from this and other polls shows that it is the leadership which is increasingly out of step with its supporters.'
The Sedgefield MP added: 'Labour's leadership now has a huge opportunity to be at the front of a popular campaign against the Government's Brexit deal and make sure the public are given the right to have the final say in the form of a People's Vote.
'I urge Jeremy to seize this chance to change the course of history, before it's too late.'
YouGov surveyed 1,034 Labour Party members between December 17 and 21 2018.
The pollster also surveyed a representative sample of 1,675 British adults on December 18-19.

824658990,"'Dumped old fashioned politics': 7 Labour MPs resign from the party over Brexit, 'anti-Semitism'

A group of Labour MPs have announced that they are quitting the party and will sit as Independent MPs in the house of commons, hitting out at leader Jeremy Corbyn for presiding over an ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" party.
The seven Labour MPs quitting the party to become 'The Independent Group', are Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey.
Announcing their resignations in Westminster, Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree took to the stage first, to claim that she could not stay in the party any more because it had become ""institutionally anti-Semitic.""
Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, a prominent 'People's Vote' advocate appealed to all MPs, not just Labour, to join their group, as the current parties are part of the problem, not the solution.
He argued that “It is time we dumped this country’s old fashioned politics.” Umunna claimed the UK needed a political party “fit for the hear and now” and the “first step in leaving the tribal politics behind.""

Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, insisted that it had not been an easy decision to make but that he believed that the Labour Party had been hijacked by the “machine politics of the hard left.""
Labour has been dogged by accusations of acting too slowly in investigating claims of anti-Semitism within the party.
The issue became such a toxic issue for the party that it even led to veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge allegedly calling Corbyn an “anti-Semite"" in the house of commons.
Labour’s governing body, finally agreed in September to adopt the IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism with all 11 examples following highly charged debate over its pitfalls, with accusations that free speech in relation to Palestine could be curtailed.
Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, revealed that it had been a very painful decision to resign her membership but suggested the current Labour party were guilty of patronizing the electorate.

Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, in perhaps a dig at Corbyn'sforeign policyy, says the new independent group “does not think every problem in the world has been created by the west.”
Ann Coffey, MP for Stockport, says the Labour party is no longer a broad church.
“The current leadership has been very successful at changing the party beyond recognition,” she says.
“Loyalty cannot be an end in itself.”
Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South, says he is sickened by anti-Semitism in the party and angry that the Labour leadership is facilitating Brexit.
He also highlighted Corbyn's position on a number of Foreign countries.

“Jeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side in so many international issues, from Russia, to Syria to Venezuela,” Gapes claimed.
Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has reacted to the news by saying he is saddened by the decision of MPs to leave the party.
In a statement Corbyn said: ""I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945.""

832947554,"Tom Steyer Rallies Supporters after Conclusion of Mueller Report

Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer issued a video on Friday rallying supporters after the lackluster conclusion of the report issued by special counsel Robert Mueller.
Mueller’s report did not include any additional criminal indictments, despite leftists dreaming that President Donald Trump or members of his family would be sent to jail as a result of the investigation.
Steyer called for “perspective,” reminding them that Mueller already indicted people connected to Trump such as Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.
“It has already led to the indictment of 34 individuals,” Steyer said, leaving out the fact that 26 of them were Russians as well as three Russian companies.
He reminded supporters that the Mueller report had sparked other investigations into “Mr.
Trump’s criminality.”
Steyer called for Attorney General William Barr to do a full release of the report.
He urged supporters to cling to the idea that Trump already “participated in crimes” while in the presidency.
“Let’s learn as much as we can from this report knowing that the information is already in that this president needs to be impeached,” Steyer said.
We already know from other continuing investigations that the sitting president has committed crimes in office.

813949697,"Police training up for deployment to NI in case of no-deal Brexit

Almost 1,000 police officers are being trained up for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of violence stemming from a no-deal Brexit.
Chiefs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland had asked for the reinforcements to handle any problems that may arise from a hard border.
It is thought large numbers of officers from Britain on the streets could anger Irish republicans.
But additional officers are thought to be necessary to cover the possibility of violence with a no-deal Brexit.
Cars burn during Nationalist rioting in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast, Northern Ireland on July 12, 2010.
The rioting started after the police forced the Protestant Orangemen's traditional 12 July parade against the wishes of a group of Nationalist residents
The training will mean officers are pulled from their regular duties, according to The Guardian.
News of the continued no-deal Brexit preparations came on another difficult day for Theresa May.
What is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?
The so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.
This is what it means: What is the backstop?
The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal.
The divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition if that deal is not in place.If effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market..
This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.
It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.
Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it?
Because Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.
This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal.
But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.
Why do critics hate it?
Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.
Getting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.
Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom..
What concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?
During the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.
Importantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea - even if some goods still need to be checked.
The Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments - meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.
It also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal - promises it says can be enforced in court.
What did the legal advice say about it?
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.
This would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.
The DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.
After a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.''
Mr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.
However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.
Mr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.
He said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'
Mr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.
The remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.
Mr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.
A spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the leaders of the remaining 27 countries 'have been very clear' that what is on the table 'will not be renegotiated'.
At a press conference in Brussels, Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held before the Commons has its say on the deal in the week of January 14.
She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: 'For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'
She said Mr Juncker is 'always willing to listen to Mrs May's views on the backstop', but when asked what else he can do to help her deal get through Parliament, she rebuffed any chance of altering the backstop as it currently stands.
And Mrs May's deal drew criticism from Tory former minister Ben Gummer, who co-authored the Conservative manifesto at the last election.
Mr Gummer, who lost his Ipswich seat at the 2017 election, said it would leave the country poorer for generations.
He told the BBC: 'I think it is probably unique in modern parliamentary history, because Members of Parliament are being asked to walk through the division lobbies to make the country, and their constituents, permanently poorer and less secure.
'Not just in one generation, but in two or three.'
Mr Gummer said if Parliament failed to find a route through the Brexit situation, a new referendum should be held.
The comments came as Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be 'considerable' in the agricultural sector.

Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal, Dublin warns
Irish agriculture minister Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit
Ireland will demand hundreds of millions of euros in aid from the EU if the UK crashes out of the bloc, the country's agriculture minister warned today.
Michael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit - with beef, dairy and fishing among the most vulnerable sectors.
The warning came as Brussels again appeared to dismiss Theresa May's plea for fresh concessions to help her get the Brexit package through the Commons later this month.
An EU commission spokeswoman also said there were no plans for any further negotiations with the UK - despite the PM insisting talks are ongoing.
The latest standoff has sent the chances of a no-deal Brexit spiralling, as Mrs May looks down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14.
Killing off the plan could throw the government into chaos, with the UK set to crash out of the bloc by default at the end of March unless politicians can agree another course.
Irish PM Leo Varadkar is seen as having been one of the main obstacles to sealing a deal, after he insisted on a 'backstop' to guarantee no hard border with Northern Ireland.
The DUP has condemned the proposals because they risk splitting the UK, while Brexiteers say it will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere.
However, the intervention by Mr Creed today underlines the threat of disruption Ireland faces if there is no Brexit deal.
Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) is looking down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14
Speaking about the need for support from the EU in the event of no deal, he told the Irish Independent: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
'Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
Nearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain, according to 2016 government figures.
The country is also considered a vital 'land bridge' to the European continent
'There is a high level of awareness of Ireland's unique exposure to the UK food market,' Mr Creed said.
'I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.'
But, he added: 'In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.
If Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April.
Dublin outlined its no deal contingency plans before the Christmas break.
They include schemes for port overhauls, a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island's integrated electricity network.
Up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required.
At a press conference in Brussels this morning Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held with the UK before the Commons vote.
She said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.
'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'
Ms Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, and confirmed Brussels is ready to start preparations on a new trade deal 'immediately after the signature' on the deal from the UK Government.
She added: 'For now no further meetings are foreseen between the commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'

832920387,"Mueller's Investigation Lasted 674 Days.
Here's How That Compares to Other Probes

Longer than Watergate, but much shorter than Iran-Contra or Whitewater.
That’s how Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation stacks up compared to other independent probes by the Justice Department.
The investigation concluded Friday when Mueller sent a final report to Attorney General William Barr — 674 days after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed him as special counsel to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
(The final number may be a few days longer, as a Mueller spokesman said staffers will stick around to close up shop.)
The next phase will begin shortly, as the Department of Justice, the White House and Congress hash out how much of the report to make public.
“I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr wrote in a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

Given the complexity of Mueller’s investigation, which resulted in the indictment, conviction or guilty plea from 34 people and three companies plus several other investigations referred to career prosecutors, the probe moved swiftly.
But it was also much shorter than some other notable probes by special counsels and special prosecutors in the past.Here’s how the length of Mueller’s probe compares to previous investigations.
Watergate: 155 days
Five men were arrested while trying to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972, but it took several months before the Washington Post confirmed that break-in was linked to President Richard Nixon.
A special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was not appointed to investigate Nixon’s involvement until May 18, 1973.
On October 20, 1973, Nixon was successful in requesting the Acting Attorney General to fire Cox, after both the previous attorney general and deputy attorney general refused and resigned.
Cox’s investigation lasted 155 days.
Nixon resigned nine months later, on Aug. 9, 1974.
Waco: 316 days
In February 1993, federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives raided a Branch Davidian religious compound near Waco, Texas, after the agency heard reports that the Christian cult, under the leadership of David Koresh, had stockpiled  illegal firearms and explosives.A 51-day standoff resulted in a violent gun battle that led to 76 deaths, including more than two dozen children.
The FBI did not believe Koresh when he said he and his followers would come out eventually, and so the FBI deposited containers of gas in the compound on April 19, 1993.
Next, gunfire and flames seemed to break out simultaneously, and firefighters could not enter the compound.
On Sept. 9, 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno named former Sen. John Danforth as special counsel to head a review of what happened in 1993, after the FBI uncovered information suggesting “incendiary or pyrotechnic devices may have been used.” On July 21, 2000, Danforth released findings that concluded federal agents did not fire shots at members of the religious group, nor did they start the deadly fire.
His investigation lasted 316 days.
The Starr Report: 1,693 days
In January 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske Jr. as the independent counsel in charge of investigating financial irregularities at Whitewater Development Corp., an investment that Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved with.
In August 1994, Kenneth Starr replaced Fiske as independent counsel.
Reno approved Starr’s request to expand his investigation to include Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in January 1998.
Eight months later, on September 9, 1998, Starr released a report to Congress outlining 11 possible grounds for impeachment.
Two days later, the report was made public.
Between Fiske’s appointment and Starr’s release of his report to Congress, 1,693 days passed.
Ultimately, in February 1999, the Senate acquitted President Clinton of the two articles of impeachment he faced: perjury and obstruction of justice.
Iran-Contra: 2,420 days
Around 1986, President Ronald Reagan’s administration sold arms to Iran, which was at war with Iraq.
In exchange for the weapons, Iran was supposed to help the United States procure the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
Profits from the deal then went to “contras,” rebel groups who were fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua at the time.
The United States was not supposed to sell weapons to Iran or pay ransoms, so Attorney General Edwin Meese III requested that an independent prosecutor be appointed.
On Dec. 19, 1986, a panel of judges appointed Lawrence Walsh.
The Department of Justice confirmed that appointment a few months later.
Walsh’s investigation lasted approximately eight years and resulted in charges against 14 people.
He submitted his final report to the U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 4, 1993, meaning his probe lasted about 2,420 days.

Sputnik: What do we know?
What can we expect?
It looks like Donald Trump won't receive any political damage to his image, because of course the report doesn't recommend any further indictments.
What's your stance?
Earl Rasmussen: Obviously there are certain elements, mostly in the mainstream media that's been stoking this, and certain members on the Hill, in Congress, that were hoping for something, because we heard over and over again that the next bombshell was coming.
But you're correct, there's nothing explosive, and with no new indictments coming out, and really if you look at the indictments that were there, there's nothing related at all to any type of conspiracy or collusion as far as the six people indicted who are US citizens.
And the Russians that are indicted are questionable.
Let's face it, Concord Management tried to file discovery, and now [prosecutors are] trying to block information, saying it's 'classified'.

There's really no evidence, and for Mr. Trump, although he will suffer some political damage, I think for the most part the objective of this whole hoax is not coming to fruition.
Sputnik: For now of course, no one really knows what's in the report, how long it is, how much it actually deals with the president's own actions.
However, a lot of political and perhaps emotional capital was invested in this Mueller probe.
Is this a bit of an anticlimax?
Earl Rasmussen: I think for many it is an anticlimax, absolutely.
There's so much invested here.
Two plus years, millions of dollars, political capital on both sides, and you've got people who have lost their livelihoods.
A lot of the people that were brought in, their names exposed, their reputations were damaged.
We've got the six people that have been charged [for] things that happened ten years ago; some are financially ruined now; some will spend time in jail for lying to Congress or lying to the FBI over minor financial things that may have gone unnoticed without this.
You look at the other side too, and we've got damage to international relations, not just with Russia, where what has occurred is just outrageous, but also Europe.
I mean we forced Europe to follow through on sanctions that there's no evidence for.
They've lost business as a result of that, so I'm sure the Europeans will be quite interested in seeing more and learning more about what's coming out of this as well.

The country is divided.
Talk about political discord – the media here has done a great job doing that.
In a lot of ways we've done a lot of damage to ourselves chasing after something that's not there.
Sputnik: US Attorney General William Barr is going to now summarise the report and decide on how much to share with Congress.
What can we expect?
Earl Rasmussen: Personally I think the whole report should be released to the public at some point in time.
He'll release it to Congress, I think most of it will probably be provided to Congress.
There should be nothing there that they don't already know.
They've been doing their own investigations, have called in their own witnesses, so there really should be no surprises there.
Obviously the parties will probably try to manipulate the report [against the other party] in order to potentially posture for the 2020 presidential elections.

833053628,"Confident Trump and anxious Washington wait for AG Barr's report on Mueller's key findings

Justice Department sources tell Fox News that Attorney General William Barr is working to quickly release the primary conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded Russia investigation.
That information, however, wasn't expected to emerge on Saturday.
For Washington insiders, the waiting game isn't easy.
Speculation about the hotly anticipated report's contents has been rampant.
Still, in a show of confidence, President Trump waved and flashed two thumbs up to supporters as he returned to his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.
The president's demeanor signaled the administration's strong belief that Mueller's long-awaited final report contained good news.
Among other things, the special counsel is not recommending any further indictments as part of his inquiry, which effectively ended Friday, according to a senior Justice Department official.
Further, Mueller did not charge any Americans with illegally conspiring with Russians on any matter, including election interference -- a foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago.
Even as Trump remained in Florida, Barr was working ""hand in hand"" on Saturday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in reviewing the Mueller report at the DOJ, the senior official said.
Fox News is told that Barr may run the conclusions past White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Emmett Flood, who were in Mar-a-Lago, before they are released -- but that Trump's personal attorneys are unlikely to be notified.
It will likely take longer for the facts supporting the conclusions to come out, Fox News is told, because there may be materials that are either classified, or subject to executive privilege in the factual material.
WATCH THE MEDIA MELTDOWN: RACHEL MADDOW BECOMES VISIBLY EMOTIONAL AFTER MUELLER REPORT DROPPED, WITH NO NEW INDICTMENTS
Barr notified key congressional leaders in a letter Friday evening that Mueller finished his investigation, adding that a summary of the probe’s findings may be provided to lawmakers as soon as this weekend.
Fox News has also confirmed that House Democrats, meanwhile, began a conference call at approximately 3:10 p.m.E.T.
Saturday with “chairs of relevant committees” discussing next steps regarding the Mueller report and messaging.
New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will host as Caucus Chair, and attendees will include Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, as well as Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters.
At the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for a public release of the Mueller report, and said she would reject any classified briefing of the report's findings to lawmakers.
Any briefing must be unclassified so that members of Congress can talk about it publicly, Pelosi said.
Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Saturday: ""It’s the end of the beginning.
But it’s not the beginning of the end.""
He added: ""We’re spending the weekend in anticipation of what Attorney General Barr may share with Congress,"" and cautioned that Democrats were ""concerned executive privilege could be asserted broadly here"" to hide the report's key findings.
In a Saturday conference call, Coons also issued a warning for his fellow Democrats, many of whom have pinned astronomical political hopes on Mueller's findings: ""Once we get the principal conclusions of the report, I think it's entirely possible that that will be a good day for the president and his core supporters.""
CHAFFETZ: HYPOCRITICAL DEMS SUDDENLY CARE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY
Some advocacy groups have made clear they aren't keen on waiting.
A nonprofit organization on Friday night filed the first known Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking the immediate and total public disclosure of Mueller's completed report and all related documents, echoing bipartisan calls for transparency following his nearly two-year probe into whether the Trump campaign illegally colluded with Russia.
The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) wrote in an emergency complaint filed in a Washington, D.C., federal district court that the ""public has a right to know the full scope of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and whether the president of the United States played any role in such interference.""
The delivery of the Mueller report, which a DOJ official called ""comprehensive,"" does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia or of obstruction by the president.
That's good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller's prosecutors.
Still, some key details remain unanswered, EPIC said, prompting its litigation.
House Democrats, meanwhile, have somewhat downplayed the Mueller probe and suggested that the left-leaning lawmakers themselves might take on the job of trying to prove collusion, not ruling out the possibility of Mueller being asked or subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees.
CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
“If the Justice Department doesn't release the whole report or tries to keep parts of it secret, we will certainly subpoena the parts of the report and we will reserve the right to call Mueller to testify before the committee or to subpoena him,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
While the Mueller probe’s conclusions are not yet known, the investigation already has led to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for nearly three dozen people and three companies.
All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; and three Russian companies.
Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet.
Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
OPINION: WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD REJECT THE MUELLER REPORT
Despite all that prosecutorial activity, though, Americans were not implicated in criminally colluding with Russia to influence the election.
In a series of posts on Twitter on Friday, journalist Glenn Greenwald -- who also called for the release of the Mueller report -- repeatedly emphasized that point, and condemned pundits for hyping the Mueller report irresponsibly for nearly two years.
""It's truly fascinating to watch Dems grapple with the fact that Mueller finished his work without indicting a single American for conspiring with Russia over the election: everything from ""nobody has read his report!""
(irrelevant to that fact) to 'sealed indictments!'
(unhinged).""
Greenwald wrote.
In another post, he criticized media outlets for promoting the anti-Trump rhetoric of partisan commentators like ex-CIA Director John Brennan -- an Obama appointee whose security clearance was revoked last year because, the Trump administration said, he was using it to lend credence to political attacks.
""You can't blame MSNBC viewers for being confused,"" Greenwald continued.
""They largely kept dissenters from their Trump/Russia spy tale off the air for 2 years.
As recently as 2 weeks ago, they had @JohnBrennan strongly suggesting Mueller would indict Trump family members on collusion as his last act.
... Oh gosh - turns out that if you hire ex-CIA Directors to be 'news analysts,' they'll abuse our airwaves to disseminate self-serving disinformation.""
He concluded: ""How - if you're an MSNBC viewer (or consumer of similar online content) - can you not be angry & disoriented having been fed utter [bulls--t] like this for 2 straight years with basically no dissent allowed?
Just listen to what they were telling you to believe & how false it was.""
JEROME CORSI CELEBRATES END OF RUSSIA PROBE, SAYS HE'S VINDICATED IN DECISION TO RESIST MUELLER BULLYING
Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it ""imperative"" to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
""The American people have a right to the truth,"" Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a ""sneak preview"" of the findings.
""The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,"" they said in a joint statement.
It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller's findings.
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying, ""We look forward to the process taking its course.""
But Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get ""an early look"" before they were made public.
Giuliani said it was ""appropriate"" for the White House to be able ""to review matters of executive privilege.""
He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
He later softened his stance, saying the decision was ""up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.""
The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report's arrival Friday.
Barr's chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.
Fox News' Ed Henry, Mike Emanuel, Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Mueller Report Finally Drops, Dems Prepare List of Demands
It's Friday, that means it is panel time!
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has submitted a confidential report to US Attorney General William P. Barr, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.
The Justice Department notified Congress late Friday that it had received Mueller's report but did not describe its contents.
Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers in the coming days.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May previously sought agreement by the EU's 27 leaders on a ""technical extension"" of Article 50, pushing Brexit day back to June 30, in the event that the House of Commons ratifies the withdrawal agreement in its third vote on the deal.
The extra time would be needed to pass the necessary legislation.
May's appeal to the heads of state and government was described by sources as ""90 minutes of nothing.""
She was unable to offer any answers as to how a no-deal Brexit would be avoided if the deal were rejected again.
The leaders imposed a new Brexit timeline on the prime minister to avoid a possible accidental no-deal scenario next Friday, March 29.
Under the new timeline, Britain will stay a member state until April 12 if the withdrawal agreement is rejected by MPs.
If lawmakers accept the prime minister's Brexit deal, the UK will leave the EU by May 22.
The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can ""indicate a way forward"" and agrees to hold European elections.
The FBI has reportedly joined a criminal investigation of the certification process for Boeing's 737 Max 8 jets, two of which have crashed since October, killing 346 people.
The Seattle Times first reported that the bureau is assisting federal aviation investigators in a federal grand jury probe based in Washington, DC, looking into the process.
Indonesian airline Garuda said Friday that it's canceling a multi-billion-dollar order for 49 737 Max 8 jets in light of the deadly crashes.
""Our passengers have lost confidence to fly with the Max 8,"" Garuda spokesperson Ikhsan Rosan told CNN.
The Indonesian carrier ordered 50 of the planes in 2014 for $4.9 billion.
It has taken delivery of one of them but has now sent a letter to Boeing saying it no longer wants to receive the remaining jets on order, Ikhsan said.
Garuda is the first airline to say it's canceling a 737 Max 8 order.
US President Donald Trump on Thursday took more shots at the late Sen. John McCain, despite growing calls from Republicans and veterans groups to stop attacking the Arizona GOP lawmaker who died last year.
In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump called McCain ""horrible"" for his 2017 vote against a congressional Republican measure to repeal Obamacare and accused him of handing a dossier of explosive claims about Trump's ties to Russia to the FBI for ""very evil purposes.""
When asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo why he continues to criticize McCain, who died seven months ago after battling brain cancer, Trump claimed he was prompted by the news media.
""I don't talk about it,"" the president said.
""People ask me the question.
I didn't bring this up.
You just brought it up.
You just asked the question.""
Trump renewed his attacks on McCain last weekend in an apparent reaction to a news report about the controversial dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele, not after he was asked about his attitude toward the senator.
He has continued to lash out at McCain over the past several days, telling reporters on Tuesday, ""I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be,"" and then on Wednesday grousing about not receiving a ""thank you"" for approving funeral arrangement plans for McCain, despite his dislike for the former senator.
McCain was memorialized at Washington's National Cathedral last fall, and Trump was not invited to attend.
Trump authorized a government airplane to transport McCain's remains from Arizona to the nation's capital, but the cathedral said Trump's approval was not needed to host the funeral.
It took New Zealand just six days to announce an immediate plan to change to the nation's gun policy after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week.
On Thursday, a day after the first victims were laid to rest, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used in last week's attack.
Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance in Parliament.
The new law could be in place as soon as April 11.

814251296,"UK Govt to Perform No Deal Brexit Dress Rehearsal with 150 Trucks

The British government is going to wargame the impact of leaving the European Union on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on Monday, chartering dozens of articulated lorries to simulate the impact of traffic near the port of Dover.
After years of ignoring the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union fully and without a deal keeping it tied to the rules and regulations of the bloc, the British government is now apparently rushing to make preparations.
One of these is a trial by the Department of Transport to examine using the former Manston airport in Kent as a lorry park in case of congestion around the Port of Dover, one of the main points of cross-Channel traffic with Europe.
Up to 150 large trucks will be parked and released from the airfield at 0800 and 1100 Monday morning to test the utility of the site to relieve pressure on Kentish roads including the M20, which can become extremely busy when there are delays at the ferry port.
An email from the Department for Transport send to Cliffsend Parish Council reported by Kent Online said of the test: “The use of Manston airfield as an HGV holding facility is one of the traffic management measures as part of the current draft plan to alleviate congestion on Kent roads in the event of any disruption at the border.

“This also now includes if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, should there be any disruption… Staff will be positioned along the whole route throughout the trial to monitor flows.
If required at any time, flows from Manston can be halted as needed.”
The plan is a variant of Kent Police’s Operation Stack, which uses the M20 as a giant lorry park while leaving one lane open for other traffic in the case of the Port of Dover being closed to traffic.It was activated dozens of times in 2015 when industrial action and  illegal migrantscongregating at the Port of Calais — from which much of Dover’s traffic flows from and to — effectively halted the flow of ships and Eurotunnel freight trains.
‘Second Dover’: UK to Reopen Ramsgate Port in No Deal Brexit Plans Boost https://t.co/Y6TKLTGGPy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 4, 2019
The delays were so bad the British government even drew up plans to deploy the British Army to help control traffic in the south of England as instability in northern France prevented the free flow of trade.
As well as managing traffic in Kent to prepare for a potential resumption of border checks on trucks, the government has also handed out a number of contracts to reopen ferry routes to other ports, many of which have seen their services closed in recent years.
One of those is Ramsgate, which is now being dredged to take ships carrying 3,000 lorries a day after Brexit.

824256050,"Ireland and the Border

Ireland and the Border
Ireland has been a trouble spot since the invasion of the island by the English king Henry II in 1171, whether to prevent a rival, Strongbow, from controlling the area, or to overcome the damaging opprobrium resulting from the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 29, 1170, by four of his knights.
Declaring that Ireland was a part of his empire, Henry II changed the course of Irish history as resident Normans in the area pledged their loyalty to the British crown.
Almost a thousand years later, the borders of Ireland remain a difficult political problem, and indeed may have dominated the debate over the last few years over the issue of Brexit.
Economic and political relationship between the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, has been a central factor in the negotiation process of the UK and EU over Brexit.
Thus, the border issue is not simply bilateral, it is also an EU issue.
The problem is compounded by the fact that the Brexit issue evokes historical memories as well as having political as well as economic implications.
After Henry II, inhabitants lost territory to new arrivals from England, who formulated the laws.
The crucial problem arose with Henry VIII and his decision to leave the Catholic Church and have the country adopt Protestantism, to which many Irish were opposed in their desire to remain Protestant as well as speak their own language, Gaelic.
Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland to reestablish control over Ireland, massacring over 2,000 of the population in the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, while Ulster, a Protestant bastion, remained loyal to England, as it still is.
Cromwell remains a villain for many Irish.
More troubles ensued during following centuries.
During the great famine 1845-49, Ireland lost more than 1.5 million victims.
By 1900 the country had only half the number of inhabitants it had in 1830.
On January 1, 1801 the Act of Union united the two areas, previously linked by personal union, into a single kingdom, the United Kingdom.
The Chief Secretary, the key administrator in governing Ireland, ruled on behalf of London.
However, the struggle for Irish emancipation starting in the 19thcentury continued.
After the failed Easter Rising against British rule in April 1916, guerrilla war between the IRA and Britain occurred, 1919-1921.
It ended in May 1921 with the partitioning of the country, ending British rule in most of Ireland.
The Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion in December 1922 while Northern Ireland, NI, remained in the UK.
Finally, on April 18, 1949 the Republic of Ireland was established, an independent republic, headed by a president.
However, hostilities between the IRA and the government continued in Ulster, virtually 30 years of civil war, including the Bloody Sunday incident on January 30, 1972 when 28 unarmed civilians were killed by British troops during a protest March in Derry (Londonderry).
Hostilities lasted until April 10, 1998, Good Friday, which began the peace process.
Good Friday was concerned with creating an infrastructure of cooperation between north and south, between the Irish government and the newly created power sharing Irish Assembly, in Northern Ireland.
It also implied the normalization of relations between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and the ROI.
The normalization would mean the opening of the border which had previously been manned by British soldiers.
As a result, since both countries are still in the EU, there are no checks on goods or people moving between Northern Ireland and the ROI.
The open border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process as well as of economic cross-border cooperation.
All political sides in the Brexit negotiations agree there should not be a “hard” border, checks on persons, goods, or infrastructure, dividing NI from the ROI whatever the outcome of final negotiations.
Therefore, keeping the border open and abiding by the Good Friday Agreement is critical.
As a result, Brexit negotiators devised the so-called “backstop,” a political invention, a fallback position, to keep the border open as much as possible between the ROI and NI, even if no comprehensive trade deal can be reached between UK and EU.
NI is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another EU country, the ROI.
By backstop, the whole of UK, according to Prime Minister Theresa May, would enter in a single customs territory with EU, no tariffs on trade in goods between UK and EU, though NI would be aligned to other rules of the single market.
Two problems are related to this.
One is that May does not favor a permanent customs deal lest it prevent British free trade deals with other countries.
The other is that her proposals have twice been defeated in the House of Commons, on January 15, 2019 by 432-202, and on February 14, 2019 by 303-258.
In the latter vote, her own Conservative party, 5 voted against her, and 67 others abstained.
The essential features of the EU, single market and customs union, allow people, goods, and services to enter other EU countries without inspection.
The basic problem is that if Britain leaves the EU it will probably lead to delays and checks in this policy.
The reality would be that the ROI and NI would be in different customs and regulatory regimes, and British goods would be checked at the border.
The backstop, a last resort, is intended to prevent full border controls on goods crossing between ROI and NI.
For Britain one problem is that it can only end the backstop arrangement with EU agreement.
The issue is both economic and political.
The fear is that barriers between North and South Ireland might revive the old animosity, the Troubles, the 30-year conflict over NI status as part of the UK.Military controls of the 500-kilometer border were only removed with the Good Friday agreement which provided for more collaboration and free movement between the two entities..
Irish and British politics enter into the picture.
For 10 years in NI the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein worked together in a government coalition.
Power sharing in NI ended in on January 9, 2017 because of differences between the major parties over the issue of green energy.
It led to the general election of June 8, 2017 which resulted in a hung parliament.
The Conservatives won 42,4% of the vote and gained 318 of the 50 seats, less than a majority; the Labour Party got 40.0% of the vote and 262 seats.
Of the Irish parties.
DUP got 10 and Sinn Fein 7.
The UK government therefore relies on the DUP for a majority vote in the House of Commons, which it has twice lost.
The Republic of Ireland, like NI, would suffer from a hard border.
At the same time, it is benefitting from London-based groups banking institutions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays, asset management, and insurance companies, who want to retain access to EU markets.
ROI will also benefit from pharmaceutical and legal firms which are moving business to Dublin.
The dilemma of Brexit negotiations continues, especially since PM May does not have full support from her Conservative party.
The EU may be less inclined to make compromise concessions in view of May’s lack of control of her party.
A major problem is that the scheduled departure of UK from the EU on March 29 may have to be delayed because of the difficulties in agreeing on future trade and economic relations.
The immediate issue is to identity “backstop” with full clarity, or find a suitable alternative, to prevent a hard border.

814427361,"British PM warns of 'uncharted territory' if Brexit deal rejected

British Prime Minister Theresa May has reiterated that a delayed parliamentary vote on her widely maligned Brexit deal will go ahead later this month and warned the UK would enter ""uncharted territory"" should it be rejected by MPs.IIn an interview with the BBC on Sunday, May pledged to set out new measures to address the contentious Northern Irish ""backstop"" clause in her withdrawal plans in a bid to win over sceptical legislators.She also promised a greater role for the British Parliament in negotiations over future trade relations with the European Union..""If the deal is not voted on at this vote that's coming up then we are going to be in uncharted territory and I don't think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in parliament,"" May told the BBC.
Parliamentary opposition
The UK is poised to leave the EU on March 29, two years after it triggered Article 50, the exit clause in the EU's constitution, and kick-started arduous negotiations with European leaders over a divorce deal.
Last month, May pulled a vote on the brokered withdrawal agreement, settled on in November after more than a year of back-and-forth negotiations between London and Brussels, acknowledging it would have been roundly rejected by the UK's lower chamber House of Commons.
She later announced the vote would go forward in the week beginning January 14.
181214120018250
But parliamentary opposition to her deal remains fierce, with the main sticking point being the safety net ""backstop"" measure - which would guarantee no hard border is erected on the island of Ireland in the event that post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the bloc prove unsuccessful.
Critics of the backstop, which proposes that the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU ""unless and until"" the bloc agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border, argue it could tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely.
In an effort to assuage MPs concerns, May has lobbied her European counterparts and officials in Brussels to make concessions on the clause.
The EU, for its part, has insisted that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated but has made clear the backstop is meant only as a temporary measure of last resort.
DUP digs its heels in
The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which May's ruling Conservative Party relies on to command a majority in parliament, has urged the British leader to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its ""poison"" backstop provision on Ireland's post-Brexit border, however.
""The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the Withdrawal Agreement so toxic,"" DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement on Sunday.
""The coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff,"" he added.
The main opposition Labour Party has also pledged to vote down May's deal in parliament and threatened to initiate a no-confidence vote in her leadership should MPs refuse to back her plan.
181208084355355
Analysts said May's comments to the BBC did little to conceal the fact the British leader has no ""gamechanger"" amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement capable of swinging the parliamentary arithmetic in her favour.
""We are pretty much where we were before Christmas, with the proviso that there's less time left.
I don't see how the deal passes at the moment ... the interesting thing will be how much it loses by at the first attempt,"" Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London, told Al Jazeera.
""There are some MPs who are looking for an excuse to back the deal and so, something tokenistic and declaratory from the EU on the backstop clause would work for them, but I don't understand how that would work for the DUP, and that's where the action is,"" he added.
""Peeling off five of 10 Conservative Party MPs is neither here nor there, but if you get the DUP in line, May will give lots of parliamentarians an excuse to say, 'Well, OK, if they're happy with it I can't really justify going around moaning about the Irish backstop.'""
No-deal departure fears
Amid the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Britain's high-drama Brexit process, fears that the country could exit the 28-member EU bloc without a deal on the terms of its departure have continued to escalate.
181218142414510
The UK's central bank has warned that Britain's gross domestic product could shrink by up to eight percent in such a scenario.
The government, for its part, has forecast a potential economic slump of more than nine percent in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.
In a letter published by UK newspaper the Mail on Sunday, May warned critics of her departure plan risk damaging Britain's democracy and weakening its economy by opposing her deal.
She also alleged her deal was the only one that respects the UK's 2016 referendum result, in which 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU.
Growing calls for referendum rerun
But a new survey published by polling firm YouGov on Sunday suggested more Britons now want to remain a member of the bloc than leave it, however.
181201182945771
According to the research, which was commissioned by pro-second referendum campaign group the People's Vote, 46 percent of voters would opt to remain while 39 percent would vote to leave in the event of a rerun of the 2016 ballot.
When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favour of remaining.
The survey of more than 25,000 voters also showed that 41 percent of Britons thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote versus 36 percent who believe it should be up to parliament.
Removing those who are undecided, the split was 53 percent in favour of another referendum and 47 percent against.
Menon, however, argued the prospect of a second referendum being held remained slim.
""It's very hard to achieve - there isn't a majority in parliament for it … [and] it would require a significant extension of Article 50,"" Menon said.
""It's also impossible to say whether public opinion is in favour of a second referendum or not because answers to that question have varied basically as a function of the question that's being asked,"" he added.
""The polls split very clearly depending on the question you ask.""

832269185,"Brexit delay request will be rejected if no guarantees of deal success – France’s Le Drian

Britain’s request for a Brexit delay will be turned down by the EU if Prime Minister Theresa May cannot provide sufficient guarantees that the British parliament will approve the negotiated divorce, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
The minister told France’s parliament that May would need to make her case at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday, Reuters reports.
“A situation in which Mrs May would not be able to present to the European Council sufficient guaranties about the credibility of her strategy would lead to the extension request being dismissed and opting for a no-deal exit,” Le Drian said.
All remaining EU 27 members must agree on any extension.

832940138,"Trump faces Mueller report in Mar-a-Lago bubble

President Donald Trump gives the thumbs-up as he arrives on Air Force One on March 22 at Palm Beach International Airport, en route to Mar-a-Lago.
By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Robert Mueller or Russia.| AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster White House Trump faces Mueller report in Mar-a-Lago bubble he president kicked off a weekend at Mar-a-Lago with a speech at a fundraising dinner but few words about special counsel Robert Mueller.
PALM BEACH, Florida –When the news finally broke that Robert Mueller had completed his investigation, President Donald Trump was cloistered in the safe space of his private club here, surrounded by senior aides and the diehard supporters who pay big bucks to catch a glimpse of him..
As Washington melted down over the long-awaited news 1,000 miles away, the fierce Trump defenders here girded for an epic battle.
Story Continued Below“He seems to be able to deal with most of the stuff that most people can’t.
I am convinced that he can weather anything he’s put through,”” said Joyce Lewis Bass, a board member of the Boca Raton Regional Republican Club.
On Friday night, just feet from where Trump and his family were having dinner, local Republicans were holding a fundraising dinner.
The logo for the event: a five-dollar bill featuring a MAGA-hat clad Abraham Lincoln.
Organizers had held out hope that Trump would make an appearance at the event, and White House officials initially signaled he wouldn't attend, saying he planned to spend his night on Mar-a-Lago’s patio with First Lady Melania Trump, their son Barron, and Melania Trump’s parents.

But Trump couldn't resist.
The president spoke to the cheering crowd for about two minutes, with the first lady standing beside him on stage, according to a video of his remarks obtained by POLITICO.
He said nothing about the Mueller news.
Instead, he thanked “the legendary Pam Bondi,” Florida’s former attorney general who was honored at the dinner, and marveled at the first lady’s poll numbers.
The president also cracked a joke about the keynote speaker, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
“If Lindsey’s speaking, I want to come down here,” Trump said, “for two reasons.
No.
1: he’s a great speaker.
And No.
2, I know if I’m here, he’s not going to say anything bad about me.”
The dinner capped another whirlwind day for Trump.
As they braced for the report throughout the day Friday, Trump and his team tried to convey an image of a president putting his head down and focusing on the job. Aides arranged a meeting with the leaders of five Caribbean countries, the president announced his pick to join the Federal Reserve and he bragged about the defeat of the Islamic State.But Trump quickly overshadowed those efforts, issuing a confusing tweet that implied he was undoing North Korea sanctions that his administration had just put in place.
The tweet caught many in the White House by surprise and the administration later tried to clarify, insisting he was referring instead to not-yet-imposed sanctions.

Trump’s Islamic State victory lap was also quickly undercut.
At the end of the flight to Florida, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders entered Air Force One’s press cabin wielding a map.
ISIS no longer holds any territory in Syria, she declared, without offering any other details.
Trump later held up the same map, at one point displaying it upside down, boasting about his success in diminishing the terrorist group.
“So here is ISIS on Election Day.
Here's ISIS right now,” he said.
The only problem: the graphic didn’t compare ISIS’s current territory to Election Day in 2016.
According to photographs captured by reporters, it compared the territory to 2014, undercutting the president’s about turning things around immediately after taking office.
“You guys can have the map.
Congratulations.
You’ll spread it around,” Trump told reporters, handing them the document.
Sanders quickly snatched up the paper.
Trump tried to project calm throughout the day, distancing himself from the image of a man about to suffer a political blow.
On his arrival at the airport here, he delighted in the adoration of his supporters, signing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.
But there were more subtle signs that the White House — like all of Washington — had assumed crash position ahead of the transmittal of Mueller’s report to Attorney General Bill Barr, which happened at 5pm, shortly after a sudden blinding hailstorm tore through an already-anxious capital: White House counsel Pat Cipollone joined the president at Mar-a-Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter, as did Sanders, who doesn’t always travel with the president on weekend trips.
“We'll see what happens,” Trump had said early in the day as he departed for his weekend in Florida.
“There was no collusion.
There was no obstruction,” he repeated once again.
“Everybody knows it.
It's all a big hoax.
It's all a witch hunt.”
But he didn’t mention Mueller for the rest of the day.
Though the president is often eager to field reporters’ questions, he ignored journalists as he sat alongside the Caribbean leaders, under two gold and crystal chandeliers.
For once, it seemed, Trump felt he had nothing more to say.
He was content to wait.
By late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Mueller or Russia.
Friday's fundraising dinner was hosted by the Palm Beach County Republicans.
Tickets for the fundraiser started at $375, with sponsorship packages going as high as $25,000.
On Friday afternoon, a person helping to organize the dinner predicted Trump would attend, especially given that the event was held just feet from the room where Trump huddled with the Caribbean leaders.
“We very much expect the president to come,” the person said.
“It’s in his house.”
The mood at Mar-a-Lago Friday afternoon was low-key, despite the furor over the Mueller developments swirling in Washington.
A nearby parking lot was packed with luxury cars, including a bright yellow Porsche and a chrome Rolls Royce.
A woman in the parking lot sported a black fur coat in the nearly 75-degree weather.
Mueller’s actual conclusions remain under lock and key at the Justice Department.
But supporters here seemed unfazed by the report’s imminent disclosure.
Asked if she’s certain the president can overcome the Mueller probe’s findings, Toni Holt Kramer, a Mar-a-Lago member and founder of the Trumpettes USA, a Trump fan club, said via email, “Positive!!

813953435,"Majority of Tory voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's deal

Conservative voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, a major survey reveals today.
In a rare glimmer of hope for the Prime Minister, the poll finds that Tory voters back her deal by 46 per cent to 38.
While a majority of voters across all parties (53 per cent) said Mrs May had failed to get a good deal – they also believed any alternative leader would have fared 'just as badly' in negotiations with the EU.
Tory voters back Theresa May's deal by 46 per cent to 38, according to a new survey
But an accompanying survey of Conservative Party members paints a far gloomier picture, with activists opposed to the deal negotiated by their own leader by 59 per cent to 38.
The research, co-ordinated by Professor Tim Bale of London's Queen Mary University, also reveals that Tory members are convinced a no-deal Brexit would be better than Mrs May's plan.
More than half of members polled (57 per cent) said their first preference was to leave with no deal.
Dublin 'mega-money' warning over Brexit Ireland last night warned Brussels it will demand 'mega-money' in the form of aid if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
Ireland's agriculture minister said a no-deal Brexit would have a crippling effect on his country's agriculture sector – which depends heavily on trade with the UK.
He said his country's farmers had been hit by the devaluation of sterling since Brexit, but said: 'A hard Brexit would make that look like a teddy bears' picnic.'
He added: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.
Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'
EU diplomats fear this could spark claims by other countries likely to be hit by a no-deal Brexit.
The figure is more than double the 25 per cent of the population as a whole who would plump for no deal.
The hardline stance of most Tory members will dismay Mrs May's allies, who had hoped that activists would use the Christmas break to pressure their rebellious MPs to fall into line.
But having the support of Tory voters – who will decide the party's electoral fate – does provide a crumb of comfort.
Downing Street will also be encouraged by a finding that 40 per cent of members said their second preference was to leave with Mrs May's deal, suggesting they could live with the compromise.
And the study found that if Mrs May's deal was pitted directly against the option of Remain in a second referendum, Tory members would grudgingly back her plan by 57 per cent to 18.
The PM was forced to postpone a vote on her Brexit deal last month after Tory whips warned she faced a crushing defeat, with more than 100 of her own MPs threatening to vote against.
The crunch vote is now due to be held on or around January 15.
But there are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart.
A senior source acknowledged that, with just ten days to go before the vote, the situation was 'still looking pretty challenging'.
Professor Bale said the findings indicated that activists were 'if anything, even less impressed than MPs' with her deal.
Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said the new polling made it clear Mrs May's deal was unacceptable to the party.
There are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart, according to a new survey
'If No 10 thought the Christmas and New Year break would make a difference then they have been proved wrong,' he said.
'The pressure coming from members is to kill off this deal, not support it.'
With 83 per cent of members opposed to a second referendum, it suggests any future leadership candidate proposing one would lose.
The research was produced by the Party Members Project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

833032366,"Mueller Report On President Trump Sent To Attorney General

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The highly anticipated Mueller Report on the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was delivered to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, Barr told lawmakers in a letter.
In the letter, Barr told lawmakers that he was reviewing the report and that he anticipates telling Congress about the conclusion in the report as soon as this weekend.
It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see and Barr said in his Friday letter that he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what information can be released to the public and Congress consistent with the law, the Special Counsel regulations and the DOJ's practices and policies.
President Donald Trump on Friday called the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax.""
""So we'll see what happens,"" Trump told reporters on Friday.
""I know that the Attorney General, highly respected, ultimately will make a decision.""
In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the next steps are up to Barr and the administration looks forward to the process taking its course.
""The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report,"" Sanders said.
The delivery of the report to the Department of Justice means that the nearly two-year inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives has come to a close.
Mueller's inquiry has led to a number of indictments and guilty pleas, including from former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
You can read Barr's full letter to Congress below:
A.G. Barr has confirmed the completion of the Special Counsel investigation.
We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials.

Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
Who sees Mueller report if it's not released?
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is now complete, and he has now submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr.
But the extent of the probe's impact is not yet known.
Here's a guide to understanding how we got here, and what may come next.
It started May 17, 2017, eight days after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.
Mueller, a former federal prosecutor and director of the FBI, was given a broad mandate: A ""full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election ... any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation ... any other matters"" within the scope of the special counsel law.
No new indictments are expected, but 34 individuals and three separate companies have been charged.
There have been seven guilty pleas and 99.5 months in prison served.
Those charged include: Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman; Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney; and Michael Flynn, who was briefly National Security Adviser.
Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian companies face 161 total charges as part of Mueller's probe, though it is unlikely they will ever see an American court.
The public may never see all of Mueller's findings — that decision rests with William Barr, the attorney general.
Justice Department guidance says Barr should only submit a ""brief notification"" containing ""an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.""
He can choose to make much of Mueller's report public if he deems it in the public interest.
Regardless of what Mueller's report shows, congressional investigations are ongoing.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, has expanded the parameters of the committee's probe.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has launched an extensive investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.
In early March, the Judiciary Committee requested documents
The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York has also launched investigations into Mr. Trump and the Trump organization.

815858385,"British ‘Yellow Vest’ Who Called Pro-EU MP a Nazi Is Arrested by Police

James Goddard, the self-styled British Yellow Vest who caused outcry when he branded Remainer MP Anna Soubry a “Nazi”, has been arrested.
Goddard, whose actions were described as “a type of fascism” by the Speaker of the House of Commons, had challenged the MP for the Leave-supporting constituency of Broxtowe near the Palace of Westminster with a group of supporters, asking why she was working to stop Brexit despite claiming to support its delivery ahead of the 2017 snap election, and branding her a “Nazi”.
The consequences were swift for the protestor — described as “far right” by most media outlets — with his Facebook and PayPal pages both being taken down within hours of the incident going viral.
Video footage of the arrest now appears to show Goddard being put in the back of a police van by an extremely large number of police officers.
The Met has confirmed “that a man in his 30s was arrested at 11.42hrs on Saturday, 12 January outside St James Park Tube station on suspicion of a public order offence” committed on January 7th — although they declined to name Goddard explicitly.
UPDATE: James Goddard arrested outside St James’s Park tube station for an alleged public order offence outside Parliament last week.

Goddard has defended his characterisation of Ms Soubry, saying the Tory MP had “shown [herself] willing to fight in favour of vested corporate interests, against the will of the people, and she is now trying to shut down legitimate free speech because it is inconvenient for her… those showing fascist, totalitarian, globalist tendencies should and will be compared to their greatest 20th-century counterparts: the National Socialist Party of Germany.”
Some observers who are not even especially sympathetic to Goddard and his boisterous group have raised concerns about the furious reaction to their protest.
Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, for example, remarked on the apparent contrast between the swift retribution when people targeted an EU loyalist politician with the many years where Brexit campaigners like himself were branded Nazis and “racist scum” without punishment or any particular sympathy from the mainstream media.
“MPs, public figures, should be free to go about and express their opinion without the threat of violence — but if we try now to put in place laws, or if the police start prosecuting people, for throwing terms of abuse, that reaction, I think, would be over the top,” he warned.

814435435,"EXPOSED: Anti-Brexit March One Third the Size Organisers Claimed

The anti-Brexit People’s Vote march was just one-third of the size organisers claimed, it has been revealed.
The group, which pushes for a second referendum, claimed that 700,000 people marched on London on October 20th, 2018, but Scotland Yard confirmed to The Telegraph that the estimate is closer to 250,000.
“The Greater London Authority (GLA) has included an estimated attendance figure of 250,000 in a debrief document,” Scotland Yard said in a statement to the conservative newspaper following a Freedom of Information request.
“Please note this is not a Metropolitan Police Service estimate as we have not recorded an estimated attendance figure for the march,” the police force added.
The People’s Vote, launched in April 2018 by Remainer MPs Chuka Umunna (Labour), Anna Soubry (Conservative), and Caroline Lucas (Green), is supported by many of the key players in the Tony Blair-backed Remain continuity campaign Open Britain and pushed for a “public vote” on the final Brexit deal — i.e., a second referendum.
Labour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan, who spoke at the march and hailed it a “historic moment in our democracy,” oversees the GLA.
The People’s Vote claims its wildly inaccurate estimations were “based on intelligence from both volunteers and professional stewards.”
Groups Promoting Anti-Brexit ‘People’s March’ Funded by the EU https://t.co/KPIGSejVs6 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 21, 2018
Leave Means Leave co-chairman Richard Tice said of the revelation, “As we knew at the time, People’s Vote lied about its march size, [and it] appears [the] GLA covered up the truth.
Did Mayor Khan know of cover up?
Enquiry needed.”
Former UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage said, “People’s Vote lied about the number of supporters at their rally in London.
Hardly surprising, the pro-EU lobby have been lying to us for over 50 years.”
Meanwhile, a petition pushing for the UK to leave the EU in a clean break has reached more than 300,000 signatures.
MPs are set to return to Parliament next week to debate Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with a vote slated for the week beginning January 14th.
Dubbed “the worst deal in history” by Mr Farage, should it be voted down the legal default is a no-deal Brexit where the UK would leave on March 29th without a deal.
The UK would then trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms — the same as she trades with the rest of the world — and can immediately begin signing new, ambitious bilateral trade agreements with countries like the United States without having to be locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc during a near-two year transition period.

833041409,"Beto O'Rourke says he still believes that Trump conspired with Russia

Candidate for the Democrat presidential nomination Beto O'Rourke has said he still believes that President Donald Trump conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election.
O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory.
'You have a president who in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government, a foreign power, to undermine and influence our elections,' O'Rourke said.
'It is beyond the shadow of a doubt that the president once in office sought to obstruct justice,' he continued.
O'Rourke was speaking at a town hall event at Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday morning when he doubled down on the Russian collusion theory
His remarks came soon after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his investigative report, which a Justice Department official says indicates he will not file further indictments.
In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
US Attorney General Bill Barr is expected to hand Congress as early as Saturday the key findings of the report.
O'Rourke, seen campaigning on Friday, reiterated his belief in a Russian conspiracy
Trump is seen arriving in Florida on Friday to spend the weekend at Mar-a-lago.
He has not tweeted or spoken publicly since news of the report broke
Chronic tweeter Trump, who was at his Florida residence for the weekend, remained uncommonly silent after spending two years repeatedly labeling Mueller's investigation an illegal witch hunt.

'The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,' Sanders said in a statement.
Meanwhile Democrats in Congress, many of who are hoping for evidence to support a presidential impeachment, were pressing hard to ensure its full contents are made public, and not just a summary prepared by the Trump-appointed Justice Department chief.

814403783,"MPs Threaten Government Shutdown to Stop No Deal Brexit

A group of Remainer MPs will attempt to stop a no deal Brexit by starving the Treasury of funds which could lead to “total paralysis” of the Government.
The MPs are set to vote on two amendments to the Finance Bill, which grants funds to the Treasury to spend on implementing no deal arrangements, on Tuesday.
Labour’s Yvette Cooper MP, who leads the group that includes former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin, and Nick Boles, said, “Our amendment would block some of the Treasury’s no-deal powers unless parliament has explicitly voted for no deal or unless the government has requested an extension of article 50.”
“We’ll be looking to table similar safeguards to all government legislation,” Ms Cooper added, with the Sunday Times reporting that the plans also have the backing of select committee leaders Hillary Benn, Rachel Reeves, Harriet Harman — all from the Labour Party –Frank Field (formerly of Labour), and Sarah Wollaston (Conservative).
Two members of Prime Minster Theresa May’s team told The Times on Saturday that the plan could lead to the “total paralysis” of Government.
A senior Government source added that Ms Cooper’s amendments would be “the first of many” attempts to stop a no deal Brexit should MPs vote down Mrs May’s unpopular EU Withdrawal Agreement in the week beginning January 15th.
There was no mention of a ""deal"" on the ballot paper.
The British public were given the binary choice of Leave or Remain.
Fantastic point from @PeterBoneUK on #Ridge this morning!#LeaveMeansLeave pic.twitter.com/yt5kEL7Mw9 — Leave Means Leave (@LeaveMnsLeave) January 6, 2019
May’s withdrawal agreement has found opposition from Brexiteers resulting in the prime minister postponing the House of Commons vote before Christmas in face of certain defeat — mainly over the issue of the Irish backstop which could see Northern Ireland locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc after the transition period, should London and Brussels not strike a deal, in order to stop a so-called ‘hard border’ with EU member state Republic of Ireland.
While the establishment media has taken to referring to the plot as a “Trump-style” government shutdown, the comparison misses a fundamental point: President Donald Trump’s shutdown is intended to push the American government to fulfil the will of the American people by securing the U.S.’s southern border, while Cooper’s team seeks to shut down the British government to frustrate the will of the people.
Both the Labour and Conservative parties’ 2017 General Election manifestos ran on pledges to respect the referendum vote and leave the EU; while Mrs May has been pushing MPs to accept her Withdrawal Agreement, a ‘no deal’ Brexit — the default legal position if the lower house votes down May’s agreement — is fulfilling the referendum result as Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.
“The only way you’re going to get on and deliver Brexit is what’s called a ‘no deal’ Brexit.
And then at the end of March we’ll be out of the EU and we will have left.
“There was no question, that I remember, on the referendum about a ‘deal’ or not; it was ‘leave’ or ‘remain.’ And the way you leave is to come out on the 29th of March.”

Appearing November 5th, 2017, on MSNBC, former Gov.
Howard Dean (D-VT) wrongly predicted special counsel Robert Mueller would indict President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner for money laundering as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.
“[W]e believe we may well have a criminal in the White House,” Howard Dean told host Keir Simmons.“Certainly, he has a special interest in the Trump family and their investments.
And we think there is substantial likelihood that he has laundered money.
That’s what his associates have been charged with.
And so, this is a very serious matter.I don’t think this about politics, actually.”
Dean described Mueller as a “straight shooter” and then predicted that he would target Kushner after indicting former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his son Michael Flynn Jr.“The next step is going to be the Trump family itself,” Dean continued.
“I expect that there’s a good likelihood Jared Kushner will be indicted for money laundering.
And then we’re going to have to see how far the Russian involvement goes.
This is serious business.”
These people are undermining our democracy, he added.
And it appears to me what Bob Mueller is investigating is whether the president of the United States engaged with a foreign power in order to get where he got.
That’s a very serious matter for this country.”
On Friday, Mueller delivered his Russia probe report to Attorney General William Barr, who stated he will provide Congressional leaders with his account of the findings as early as the weekend.

2020 Democrat presidential candidates reacted to the Friday delivery of special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election to the Department of Justice, demanding that his findings be released immediately.
What the report says is confidential, however, Attorney General Bill Barr wrote in a letter to Congress that he might be able to summarize its “principal conclusions” as early as this weekend.
There was no indication of whether Trump himself, members of his family or former campaign advisers have been implicated in collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, two of the main focuses of the investigation that has kept a cloud over Trump’s administration since he took office.

According to the Sunday Times, this group includes “former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper”, along with former Tory ministers Nicky Morgan, Oliver Wetwin and Nick Boles.
The idea is to vote on “two amendments to the Finance Bill that would lead to a gridlock in Whitehall unless Theresa May wins approval from parliament for a deal with Brussels.”
No, I have no idea either whether this plan is likely to succeed.
It could be just another of those “sounds big, means zilch” scoops that political editors come up with on a Sunday when there’s not much real news out there.
Or, for all I know, it could be the beginning of end of Brexit.
But either way, the standout point remains: parliament – the body of MPs whose ostensible purpose is to represent the interests of the British people – has gone AWOL.
Not just AWOL, actually, but completely barmy.
In order to advance its narrow, short-term aim of keeping Britain more or less within the European Union, parliament has decided to sever once and for all its relationship of trust with the electorate.
If these loser MPs weren’t so blinkered by their Remainer obsessions, they’d realise that the consequences for this will be far more serious and damaging than anything that might by caused by a “No Deal” – aka ‘hard’, aka ‘real’, aka ‘full English’ – Brexit.
Has there ever been a time in British history when parliament was so out of tune with the will of the people?Has there ever been a greater democratic deficit than when 17.4 million people voted for Brexit only to watch their parliamentary representatives so flagrantly, unapologetically and contemptuously seek to overrule them?
This isn’t just poor judgement.
It’s insanity.
Allister Heath made the case well before Christmas in a piece for the Telegraph titled ‘Hardline Remainers are becoming ever more extreme as time is running out.’
He likened the frantic desperation of Remainers to that of kamikaze pilots:
The intensity of their attacks is well beyond anything the Brexiteers can muster, which is why it feels like the pro-Remain counter-revolutionaries are winning.
To such true believers, nothing is taboo anymore, almost everything – careers, power, the Tory government, the capitalist order, even – is worth giving up to stop us from leaving the EU, especially without a formal deal.They have worked themselves up into such a frenzy that, shamefully, some would now prefer a neo-communist government to any meaningful Brexit.
There is a name for such preposterous loss of proportionality: it’s called Brexit Derangement Syndrome…
One of the many reasons the Remainers lost the Referendum was that they were quite unable to make a positive case for Britain remaining shackled to the crumbling, anti-democratic, arrogant, elitist, corrupt, sclerotic, mendacious, socialistic EU empire.
That’s what Projects Fear 1.0 and 2.0 were about: “Never mind the facts – here is some scary stuff we just made up to frighten you.”
Our only hope, I think, is to hold our nerve and never forget that whatever gibberish comes out of the mouths of our MPs – even ones we once thought we could rely on, like Brexiteer-turned-Mayite-sell-out Michael Gove – is just the delusional ramblings of a cowardly, self-serving, career-safe, unprincipled, spineless governing elite long, long past its sell-by date.
A poll last week by YouGov found that 57 per cent of Conservative Party members would prefer a no deal Brexit, whereas just 23 per cent would opt for Theresa May’s Brexit in name only “deal”.
Across Britain, outside the Remainer metropolitan strongholds, the people are still resolutely pro-Brexit.
You’d scarcely guess this from the mainstream media, even from those publications which originally came out for Brexit but which now are either rejecting it – eg the Daily Mail – or supporting it in name only – eg the Sunday Times.
We need to differentiate the signal from the noise.
The noise is all remain.
The signal is that Brexit – full, unapologetic Brexit – is still what most of us want.
Whether we’re going to get it, no one can predict.
But let’s not take at face value anything the pro-Remain Establishment – both MPs and media – tells us in the guise of dispassionate expertise.
They’re a bunch of shifty, cheating liars who are trying to sell their country down the river.
And one day, I hope, they will be made to pay for their treachery.

814403543,"Report: Theresa May Could Postpone Brexit Agreement Final Vote Again

Prime Minister Theresa May may again push back the final House of Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement in face of continued opposition by Brexiteer MPs, according to sources speaking to The Telegraph.
MPs return to the House of Commons to debate the agreement next week and Mrs May’s aides are said to be drawing up a plan to make approval of the deal conditional on obtaining further reassurances from the European Union over the Irish backstop, according to the conservative broadsheet.
The vote was postponed in December in face of certain defeat relating to objections from Brexit-supporting MPs that the backstop could lock Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the bloc and threaten the Union.
With the vote pencilled in for the week beginning January 15th, Downing Street still has not come closer to assuaging those concerns, according to insiders, particularly for the 10 Northern Irish DUP MPs that May’s Conservative government rely on.
The prime minister’s advisors are considering making approval of the deal “subject to” May’s Government obtaining assurances that the Irish backstop will be temporary.
Former Downing Street director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa told The Telegraph, “Getting conditional approval isn’t enough for the Government to go ahead but it may be enough to show the EU there is a majority if they can move a little further.”
She added that it could allow the Government to “return for a third go at the meaningful vote, with a proven recipe for a majority” at a later date — despite there being less than three months until the UK formally leaves the EU.
Mayday: Conservative Party Members Prefer ‘No Deal’ Brexit to PM’s Deal https://t.co/oVeAOzPjBF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 4, 2019
Chairman of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has said that Brexiteers have not gone soft over the Christmas break and still remain resistant to supporting the agreement, saying that more than 100 Tory MPs alone are expected to rebel and vote it down.
“During the recess I read reports that I could be open to supporting the Withdrawal Agreement and that I was even ‘a work in progress.’ It was at this time that it was reported that MPs when outside the Westminster bubble could be persuaded to back the deal.
“This never seemed likely and in my own case was wishful thinking, the backstop on its own is an intolerable failure of the negotiations,” Mr Rees-Mogg wrote in the Sunday Express.
’No Way’ Northern Irish DUP Will Support May’s Brexit Deal https://t.co/d7X9mhCzer — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 4, 2019
Mrs May has doubled down on the scare tactics to push MPs into backing her Withdrawal Agreement, writing in the Mail on Sunday that critics of her deal were risking democracy and the economy.
“The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table,” she wrote adding that both Remain MPs pushing for a second referendum and Brexiteers wanting to honour the referendum result by making a clean break from the EU without a long transition tied to the bloc’s rules “must realise the risks they are running with our democracy and the livelihoods of our constituents.”
Meanwhile, a march organised by the pro-Remain People’s Vote, which calls for a second referendum, was revealed by The Telegraph to have only had a third of the attendees it claimed to while a petition calling for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March 29th, 2019, has gained more than 300,000 signatures.

833021113,"Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi celebrates end of Mueller probe after REFUSING to sign plea deal

Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi has said that the end of special counsel Robert Mueller' investigation is a personal vindication, after he refused to take a plea deal under threat of prosecution.
With a senior Justice Department official saying that Mueller's final report submitted on Friday does not recommend further indictments, author and conspiracy theorist Corsi appears to be off the hook.
'I feel vindicated.
They offered me a plea deal which I thought was fraudulent,' Corsi said in a statement to Fox News.
In November, Corsi said he had refused to plead guilty to one count of perjury because he did not believe that he had committed any crime.
Author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi (seen in January) said that he was vindicated by the end of the Mueller probe after refusing to take a plea deal
'I did not knowingly and willfully give them information I knew was false,' Corsi said on Friday.
'The fact is I wasn't going to lie to keep myself out of prison.
I did nothing wrong and it is clear I did nothing wrong or they would have prosecuted me.'
Corsi celebrated the news in a series of triumphant tweets, writing: 'It's over but it has been the worst seven months of my life.
MUELLER IS DONE.
I am in the clear.'
'I want to thank all of you who have prayed for me and my family,' he added, attributing his legal outcome to the power of prayer.
Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, about WikiLeaks publishing stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Rodger Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, who is seen above earlier this month
Court documents indicate that Stone sought to use him as an intermediary to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the election.
Stone was arrested in January in a pre-dawn raid on his home in Florida, and is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
He is currently free on bond and has pleaded not guilty on all counts.
Mueller's probe ended without any Americans being charged with conspiring with the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 election, the central allegation of the nearly two-year investigation.

"
832941978,"Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has said that he believes there will likely be further indictments from Robert Mueller as the full contents of his report are looked at in closer detail.
Schiff suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is contained in the long-awaited document.
'If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,' the California Democrat said during an interview Friday on CNN.
Scroll down for video
House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said Friday that he's willing to subpoena Robert Mueller and Attorney General Barr, if needed, to push for disclosure
'At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.
And it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.
'We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.'
Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to AG William Barr Friday afternoon
Schiff was asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would be satisfied if 'the most sensitive information' obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called 'gang of eight'.
'No, it would not suffice.
Now, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but the volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.
'We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.'
In another interview with MSNBC, Schiff said that it is entirely likely that more indictments could be forthcoming, saying instead it is 'entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be' more.
'Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,' he said.
'It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments.
'In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.
'Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.'
How the news broke: This is the letter Bill Barr, the attorney general, sent to the chairs and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees, revealing the Mueller probe is over
Though Trump himself has said the report should be made public, it's not clear whether the administration would fight subpoenas for testimony or block the transmission of grand jury material.
If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena.
A court fight could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court.
But few tussles between Congress and the White House get that far.
They often are resolved through negotiation.
The Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, could also formally ask Mueller to send his committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump, as suggested by Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding to see the full Mueller report immediately
'There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr' shouldn't release the full report, said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
With Attorney General William Barr vowing to rush out information on the report's 'principal conclusions' as soon as this weekend, Democrats were insisting they see both the complete document and the evidence in its entirety.
'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.
'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,' the leaders said.
'The American people have a right to the truth.
The watchword is transparency,' they said.
President Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, in Washington
Speaking to reporters Friday, Schumer said: 'The American people have a right to the truth.
The watchword is transparency.'
He added: 'The president himself has called without qualification or the report to be made public.
There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr should do any less.'
Schumer predicted the effort ultimately would prevail due to public sentiment.
'The demand of the public is overwhelming to see the report when it's on such a serious matter and it will be made public.
Public pressure will force it to be,' he said.
Barr himself pledged transparency during his Senate confirmation hearing.
But the strong defender of presidential power also left open the possibility he would share his own summary, rather than the report itself, to Congress – a move that would provoke a fight with the Democratic House.
Although there were reports Mueller would bring no additional indictments, there remained the possibility of indictments already sealed, or that another body such as the Southern District of New York wold bring indictments.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told MSNBC there was a 'high probability' that could happen.
'I think there is a strong possibility of additional indictments, including president Trump's family,' Blumenthal said Friday evening.
'Maybe not by the Department of Justice, main Justice.
But by other offices.
I know that you want to stick to the Mueller report.
But the Mueller report cannot be viewed in isolation,' the former prosecutor and Trump nemesis continued.
'Any more than an investigation, even though it may end, cannot lead to additional investigative leads and actions.
And so I think there's a high probability of additional indictments.'
With the White House already resisting document requests from the Democratic Congress, lawmakers want to get hold of Mueller's work product and use it as the basis for additional investigation.
Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary panels, bluntly told CNN Friday afternoon: 'We want the full report.
We want it now.
We want it before the president is able to get it or make any edits.'
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who is ramping up his own investigations
The president is a subject.
He's a subject of the investigation.
He has an inherent conflict of interest,' Swalwell continued.
'It's really inappropriate that he would even touch this.
IF he didn't do anything wrong, he would keep his hands off it.'
Sand Senate Intelligence Committee Co-chair Democrat Mark Warner: 'Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts of the Mueller report for themselves.
It must be provided to Congress immediately, and the AG should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.
Nothing short of that will suffice.'
Warner added on Twitter: 'Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.'
House Judiciary ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia, joined the call for the release of the Mueller report.
'After nearly two years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, and I look forward to reviewing Attorney General Barr's report carefully, when it becomes available.
I fully expect the Justice Department to release the special counsel's report to this committee and to the public without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,' Collins said.
'We want the full report.
We want it now,' said Rep. Eric Swalwell of California
Special Counsel Robert Muller arrives at his office building, Thursday, March 21, 2019, in Washington
Barr told key lawmakers: 'I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,' he wrote.
That raised the possibility that he would provide a mere summary of Mueller's findings, which could leave information that didn't result in charges out of the matter.
Trump said that he would have no objection to the public release of Mueller's findings – although he was not specific as to what he would see released.
'I don't mind,' he said.
'Let it come out,' Trump declared.
'Let people see it.'
And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the public via Twitter Friday afternoon: 'The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.'

A Briton Rejoices At BREXIT's Triumph | Articles

When I woke up on that warm 24th of June, at six o’clock, other than my regular neck ache, I felt something, a sense of disappointment.
I knew Leave had lost the referendum.
The exit polls had said that leave would lose.
The bookies had said we would lose.
My natural-born pessimism had seeped in.
Of course, I was in bed at this time.
I was left to my thoughts.
My own cynical thoughts.
I hadn’t actually bothered to look at the news.
That was until my sister came screeching in exclaiming, “We are leaving the EU!
You won!”
I had to make sure.
“It couldn’t be,” I thought.
“The people taking a stand?
No chance.
She must be pulling my leg.”
But lo and behold, it was true.
Utterly.
52% for Leave to a 48% for Remain.
I won’t lie, I did cry.
I’m not ashamed of it either.
I’m rarely made happy by the political discourse, but this was the rare exception.
I had actually had a sense of pride for the nation and the people who finally took a stand against its masters.
Lying there on my bed, since the power of this event had stunned me from getting up, I started to reflect on how far the movement to officially leave the EU had come to pass.
I recalled last year, at the start of the referendum campaign, right after the general election.
I was in a conference hall, partly funded by the EU, for a rally on our “Future Relationship with the European Union”.
It was a UKIP event.
I found the event powerful.
The smell of smoke filled the room.
Reporters were standing by.
It was full to the brim of people, young and old.
Nigel Farage, the man to thank for bringing us this referendum in the first place, gathered to do his speech.
Playing the song The Final Countdown by the band Europe, as he came down.
The crowd was in rambunctious cheers and applause as he talked.
They loved it.
As did I. I never considered myself a member of any movement until that day.
I loved the power it invoked in me.
I was with real people who truly believed in what they said.
They didn’t care about Political Correctness, they believed in doing what was right.
My mind fast-forwarded to one of the days where I leafleted in a city center.
In my gut, from the looks people gave me, the discussion with people on the busy street, even the diversity of the other leafleters, I felt that we were going to vote for Brexit.
Leave had the arguments and it had the people behind it.
Remain had University students prepping themselves for a degree in Politics.
I ignored my gut until the morning of the 24th and went with the bookies.
A wise choice for most instances.
But I was wrong, and I’m glad of it.
The white working class was truly key to this referendum, though, rejecting the usual, Center-Left consensus from their natural party, the extremely pro-European Labour party.
They picked the chance of controlling their own borders as they thought for the future of their own kin.
Only four of the constituencies in the poorest section of England, and Labour heartland, the North East, voted narrowly for a Remain vote, compared to the 11 constituencies that voted to leave.
Things were similar in the Labour heartland of Wales.
[EU referendum results and maps: Full breakdown and find out how your area voted, by Malcolm Coles and Ashley Kirk, Telegraph (UK) June 24, 2016]
The Left wasn’t the only one shook up by the rebellion.
Real Tories came out and defended their sovereignty in the south.
They rejected the “Great” deal made by Prime Minister David Cameron, who can now be seen to be a political failure—a deal that even Cameron’s own MPs had a hard time praising.
[EU deal: What David Cameron asked for... and what he actually got, by Peter Foster,Telegraph (UK), June 14, 2016 ] Though usually more loyal when it comes to Conservative policies, they decided they had had enough and voted with their hearts.
These people knew how the EU had harmed them.
They were not blind sheep who blindly follow their party’s whims.
They ignored the fear peddled by Obama, Cameron, Juncker, and every other “enlightened” expert.
They knew that none of those people lived or had even been to the areas affected by the EU.
The working class saw the EU applied, and they didn’t like it.
Nor did the real Tories in the south.
The economic arguments used by Remainers, meant and mean nothing if their own quality of life was being squandered because of cheap labor and living in perpetual fear from the dangerous effects of immigration.
When Britain joined what was then deceptively European Economic Community in 1973, Britain was still reeling over a lost empire.
We were stranded, and we stumbled onto what seemed like something we could latch onto.
However, that quickly changed.
The EEC became a unionist, empire-building political project.
Enoch Powell, famous for his “Rivers of Blood” speech on immigration, knew this.
He cost the Tory Party, which had he quit dramatically, the election by telling supporters to vote Labour in 1974, because it was offering a referendum on membership in the EEC.
Unfortunately, many didn’t see the upcoming globalist travesty that Enoch envisioned and in the 1975 referendum Britain gave a resounding “Yes” to the European Union (as it renamed itself, now frank about its political goal).
They never knew what they were truly getting into.
The small print was too tough to see.
The back door was closed on them.
But now that they have seen the EU’s aims, and actually feel the impact that the EU can have on the “serfs”, they gave Merkel the rightfully deserved two fingers (in America this would be one finger) to her, her bureaucrats, and her project.
This was a triumph for the nationalist movement and for nationalism in all countries—whether or not people who voted realize this.
This is bringing independence to the natural borders of nations.
You cannot merge different cultures and races in a top-down system centered around a utopian vision.
A nation can only truly look after its own.
Europe is not a nation, nor should it be treated as such.
After our historic vote, real nations, places like Holland, Denmark, and even France, are already asking for their national identity back from the globalists in Brussels and Germany in similar “Brexit” referendums.
This is not perfection, as I might seem to be portraying it.
Problems will be encountered.
We need a democratically-elected government that actually will control its own borders, instead of that we have currently.
Much of the damage is already done.
Instead of having a neoliberal economic policy, we need an economic policy that actually cares about Britain’s own industries.
In addition, we need a foreign policy, not made by NATO and the neocons of Washington DC.
The barrier of the EU would always prevent us from ever changing those matters.
Our own major parties would like keep this up also.
We can get rid of them though.
We could not get rid of Brussels.
Leaving the European Union is the right direction.
It is not the right destination for making Britain truly, great.
Nationalists should praise what has happened to the UK for what it is; a sign of the shifting tide of opinion that has been constantly ignored by elite opinion.
Hopefully Brexit will not be the last of the exodus.
The European Union has gone onto too long.
It is high time real nations broke free from its shackles.

832931332,"What happens after no one goes to jail?

Our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom
What happens after no one goes to jail?
And so, the Mueller Investigation into the alleged Trump-Russian Collusion to fix the 2016 general election against Hillary goes the way of similar investigations that have proceeded it.
Nowhere.
In the relatively recent past, we’ve watched, not in any particular order, Plamegate, Benghazi, the IRS suppression of Tea Party groups, Fast & Furious, Uranium One, and that brief puppet show that accompanied the F.B.I.
inquiry into classified documents found on Hillary Clinton’s private server.
Further back, there was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the assassination of the President of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, and his brother/advisor Ngo Dinh Nhu – twenty days before another Presidential assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.
And, oh, can’t forget Iran Contra and Whitewater.
And so, the Mueller Investigation of alleged Trump collusion with the Russians to assure his election joins the growing list.
Now, this evening from the Swamp, comes confirmation that, all along, there’s been no there there.
About half the adults in America knew as much from the get-go.
The intrepid, two-year running, deadly serious reports on the “investigation” coming from the breathless voices of the “news” media, supported by indignantly outraged politicians, ran the dial on our Bravo Sierra Meter into the red zone, almost daily.
Suppose they’ll apologize to the nation?
Many of us have learned from past experience how to see.
For example, we soon realized there was no serious inquiry into Benghazi.
Same for the Clinton Foundation, as well as for all the nefarious deeds related to the nation’s premier power couple.
We shrug—it is what it is—what can we do about it?
The FISA Court, created in the wake of 911, has become the means to conduct secret, unsubstantiated, investigations against political adversaries.
Hi ho.
NSA vacuuming up of a kazillion phone calls is, we’re told, for our protection and well-being.
Sure it is.
Unmasking of persons, led by the Obama administration’s U.S.
Ambassador to the U.N. and the Queen of Unmasking, Samantha Powers, was, well, it must have been justified, right?
Part of keeping us safe.
In the end, the important question is this: What happens when no one goes to jail?
After it becomes clear, even to Helen Keller were she here to witness events, that it’s all been a charade.
And the people indicted by Mueller et al were collateral damage in what the President has long called a “Witch Hunt.” Like a Salem Witch, it was him they meant to burn alive.
And don’t think they won’t keep trying, even though this episode has come to a flat end.
Even on this evening, March 22, 2019, it’s clear that liberals on virtually all the major networks, including FOX, will say, “Well, yea, but it’s not over yet.
There’s still…and…bla bla bla.” Breathe deep, and sip wine to stomach it all.
We wonder, a lot of us: Has government corruption always been a constant in the Swamp?
Of course, it has.
But does it seem to be escalating in its frequency and intensity?
Yes, it does.
And in other cases, both mentioned above and unlisted, what happens when none of those who plan, execute, and benefit from the corruption—what happens when not one of them go to jail?
Or, are in any meaningful way, otherwise held accountable?
We should assume these two things will happen.
First, our increasing acceptance of government corruption and deceit will continue to erode our national integrity and, eventually, our freedom.
Until, eventually, we will lose the right to claim it.
And the second thing to happen will be this: The corruption will continue to replicate itself and get worse.
In the days ahead, we will be repeatedly reminded that Robert Mueller III is a man of stellar integrity, heralded by those in the Swamp as a fearless crime fighter, a former Marine hero in Vietnam.
I have a friend from college who was a genuine gun fighter.
He joined the Corps as a Private—came out a Major, with a Silver Star.
He’s featured in a book about the legendary First Marine Recon in Vietnam.
He’s alive and well today.
In my high school band, I sat next to a small, Hispanic kid.
Once out of school, he joined the Marine Corps, and went to Vietnam.
He died there.

832956618,"Mueller Is Done, but the Trump Investigations Are Just Heating Up

The Russia investigation is over.
Or is it?
Attorney General William Barr has notified Congress that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has “concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,” as required under Justice Department regulations.
Mueller has submitted to Barr a confidential report of “prosecution or declination decisions he has reached,” and Barr has promised to review the report and advise Congress of Mueller’s “principal conclusions” as soon as this weekend.
Barr further stated that he would determine whether other information can be released to Congress and the public, committing to “as much transparency as possible.”
So what comes next?
It appears that Mueller and a small staff will close up shop in the near future.
But that does not mean that the investigation into President Donald Trump is over.
Depending on the contents of Mueller’s report, Congress may have some work to do.
Mueller’s original mandate required him to comply with all policies of the Justice Department.
It seems likely, then, that he would adhere to the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
If so, then even if Mueller found evidence of conspiracy between Trump and Russia to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of elections (sometimes referred to as “collusion”), he would refrain from filing an indictment, and instead provide his findings to members of Congress for them to consider whether impeachment is appropriate.
If that is the case, then Congress’s work will just be beginning.
Other prosecutors may also have more work to do.
During the course of his investigation, Mueller has kept a narrow focus on his own mission and farmed out related cases to at least four U.S. Attorney’s Offices.
Those investigations remain ongoing.
It is possible that Mueller has handed off additional investigations in which charges have not yet been filed, and so would be unknown to the public.
For example, the investigation of fraud and campaign finance violations against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed off to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
Cohen pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to three years in prison, but it appears that work on that case continues.
Earlier this week, a judge approved the release of redacted search warrants in the Cohen case, permitting prosecutors to keep more than 18 pages of text from public disclosure.
The redacted pages appeared under the heading “Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme.” The court stated that redaction was necessary because “disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.” This language suggests that the work of SDNY is far from over.
Subjects of the investigation could include Donald Trump, Jr., who reportedly signed at least one of the checks that were provided to Cohen as reimbursement for his illegal payments to silence woman from publicly accusing Trump of extramarital affairs .
Reports have indicated that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, has received immunity in exchange for his cooperation.
Even if Mueller’s work is done, the work of the SDNY continues.
In addition to SDNY, other U.S. Attorney’s Offices are also known to be working on matters that arose from Mueller’s work.
In December, the Eastern District of Virginia charged two associates of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with conspiring to act as agents of a foreign government and related charges.
In that case, Flynn’s former business partner Bijan Kian and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim were charged with agreeing to lobby U.S. officials and influence public opinion against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is handling the pending case against Roger Stone for lying to Congress, making false statements and tampering with witnesses.
That case is set for trial in November.
If Stone should decide to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others, prosecutors would follow those leads as well.
In addition, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Columbia has been handling cases against Sam Patten and Maria Butina , respectively .
Patten pleaded guilty in August to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and has agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others.
Patten pleaded guilty to lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party and concealing his role from the U.S. government.
Patten further pleaded guilty to illegally using straw purchasers to buy tickets to the Trump inauguration for a Ukrainian oligarch for $50,000.TThe law prohibits inaugural committees from accepting money from foreign nationals.Butina pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to act as an agent of Russia.She has been cooperating with the government.
In February, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of South Dakota indicted her boyfriend, Republican operative Paul Erickson, on wire fraud and money laundering charges.
These cases will continue, as will any cases that they spawn.
It may be a long time before the work of Mueller is really complete.

818141325,"Prime Minister May's 'Brexit Plan B' looks a lot like 'Brexit Plan A'

British prime minister Theresa May unveiled her Brexit Plan ""B"" yesterday after Parliament decisively rejected her original plan to take Great Britain out of the European Union last week.
Associated Press:
Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party accused May of being in ""deep denial"" about her doomed deal.
""This really does feel a bit like 'Groundhog Day,'"" he said, referring to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, in which a weatherman is fated to live out the same day over and over again.
Outlining what she plans to do after her EU divorce deal was rejected by Parliament last week, May said that she had heeded lawmakers' concerns over an insurance policy known as the ""backstop"" that is intended to guarantee there are no customs checks along the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.
May told the House of Commons that she would be ""talking further this week to colleagues ... to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House.
""And I will then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU.""
The bloc insists that it won't renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.
The problem with the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that May and the E.U.
kicked the can down the road for a permanent solution.
Plan ""B"" isn't much better:
The backstop proposes to keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU in order to avoid checks on the Irish border.
It is meant as a temporary measure that would last until a permanent solution is found.
But pro-Brexit U.K. lawmakers fear Britain could become trapped in it, indefinitely bound by EU trade rules.
Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz broke ranks with EU colleagues Monday by suggesting the problem could be solved by setting a five-year time limit on the backstop.
The idea got a cool reception.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that ""putting a time-limit on an insurance mechanism, which is what the backstop is, effectively means that it's not a backstop at all.""
The Labor Party is calling for a second referendum, which is political show and not a serious proposal – at least at this point.
A referendum couldn't be planned and executed by the March 29 deadline, and besides, there is no legal mechanism to withdraw Great Britain from Article 50 of the E.U.
charter – the legal basis they have invoked to withdraw from the E.U.
in the first place.
May is stuck and appears trapped between opposition E.U.
leaders, who are refusing to renegotiate the pact she agreed to in November, and members of her own party, who can't agree on how they should quit the E.U.
Looks as if May must go back to the drawing board.

833013834,"Cable viewers digest Mueller news through Hannity, Maddow

For Sean Hannity, the 'witch hunt' was finally over.
Rachel Maddow considered it the start of something.
The diametrically opposed opinion hosts, who vie for the distinction of the most popular in cable news, were the windows through which many Americans digested Friday's news that special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded a nearly two-year investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election.
While his report, or even a summary, has not been released, television news still had hours to fill talking about it.
Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe.
Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe
'The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead,' Hannity said.
'It is buried, and there was no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.
The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges.'
He lamented that lives were ruined by the investigation and said that people who have been prosecuted or convicted had committed 'process crimes,' or crimes such as lying to investigators that stem from the very existence of the investigation.
The accusations against Trump were 'what we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate.'
Hannity's Fox colleague Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' between President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government, the purported impetus for the probe.
'This investigation was always, from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country.
They told us that for years,' Carlson said.
Carlson played a highlight reel of Democrats and pundits on other channels previously predicting imminent indictments of Trump and his family members.
None were indicted and Mueller reportedly doesn't recommend any further prosecutions.
'This has been a disaster.
How can we let the people who are responsible for it continue as if it never happened?'
he said, calling for the resignation of top Democrats who have pushed the collusion narrative.
Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' with Russia, the purported impetus for the probe
While Carlson suggested it was a night Americans 'should be celebrating the great news' that no crime was apparently found regarding collusion, Hannity said citizens should be outraged by the amount of time and money spent on the case.
He promised a reckoning in the coming weeks of politicians and media figures he claimed were guilty of a rush to judgment, and his first target was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Investigations Committee.
'Schifty Schiff' read the words onscreen behind him.
'What is Maddow and all the other MSNBC conspiracy theorists, what are they going to ever do now?'
he said.
As he talked, Maddow was doing the same.
Unlike most evenings, when the two figures work in studios across Manhattan's Sixth Avenue from each other, Maddow had rushed to a studio in Tennessee where she had spent the day trout fishing.
'Finally, it happened,' she said.
'In terms of what that means and what Mueller has found, we know only the smallest little bits.
This is the start of something, not the end of something.'
In meticulous fashion, she detailed how the news that Mueller's investigation had concluded was reported and what a letter by Attorney General William Barr meant about what will be released to the public.
Rachel Maddow waited until 16 minutes into her program to discuss the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe
Democrats in Congress have already demanded the full report be released and that they see background materials; Maddow read a letter by Schiff about that on the air.
'Right now we mostly have just a ton of questions, as to what Mueller's report says, who gets to see it, who gets to decide who gets to see it and when,' she said.
It wasn't until 16 minutes into her program that she discussed the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe.
Many Fox News Channel guests, not just Hannity, focused on that detail on Friday evening.
Former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski called it 'a very clear signal that this entire hoax is over.'
Still, some Fox personalities, including Chris Wallace and Harris Faulkner, had to caution guests that Mueller's report hadn't been seen yet.
'To say that somehow this clears the president seems like the height of rushing to judgment,' Wallace said.
He dismissed the idea that those prosecuted had been charged with process crimes, saying they were very serious.
Meanwhile, on CNN, analyst and frequent Trump critic Jeffrey Toobin had an answer to colleagues who warned Trump and his supporters against prematurely celebrating.
While he isn't necessarily in the clear, the fact that the president's sons or son-in-law Jared Kushner were not indicted 'is unambiguously good news for him,' Toobin said.

822942601,"Britain’s Gavin Williamson places Russia & China on notice, I'm not joking

UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is itching for conflict with Russia and China.
He’s not mad.
Not even slightly.
But he is stupid.
Very.
Unlike former fireplace salesman Gavin Williamson, I am no military expert.
But then you do not need to be one to understand that while Britain going to war with Russia and China might work as a video game, the real thing would be an exceedingly bad idea.
So why then in a speech delivered to the Royal United Services Institute in London, did Mr Williamson’s argument on the feasibility of the real thing elicit applause rather than the shrieks of horror and demands he be sacked forthwith it should have?
This is a serious question, by the way.
It is one that cuts through British establishment verbiage to reveal a country ruled not by the sober and doughty political heavyweights of years gone by, but by foaming fanatics in expensive suits.
Also on rt.com We must be ready to use ‘hard power’ against Moscow and Beijing – UK defense chief
Placing to one side for a moment the insanity of the very concept of Britain deploying hard power against Russia and/or China, the prospect of fighting a war against two designated enemies at the same time is a recipe for disaster.
Not satisfied with that, though, Mr Williamson is actually contemplating a conflict with three different enemies at the same time – i.e.
against Russia, China, and the millions of people in Britain his government is currently waging war against under the rubric of austerity.
“Today, Russia is resurgent,"" Mr Williamson said, “rebuilding its military arsenal and seeking to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union, like Georgia and Ukraine, back into its orbit.”
For Mr Williamson and his ilk a resurgent Russia is a bad thing.
Much better in their eyes if Russia, after the Soviet era in the 1990s, had remained on its knees as a free market desert; its state institutions in a state of near collapse and tens of millions of its citizens in the grip of immiseration.
Yes, because in that scenario Western ideologues like him would have had free rein to rampage around the world as they saw fit, setting fire to country after country on the perverse grounds of ‘saving them’ for democracy.
Read more
As it is, he and his still managed to squeeze in a considerable amount of carnage and chaos in the years it did take Russia to recover.
The indictment reads as follows: Yugoslavia destroyed; Afghanistan turned upside down; Iraq pushed into the abyss; Libya sent to hell.
By the time they turned their attention to Syria, intent on exploiting an Arab Spring that NATO in Libya transformed into an Arab Winter, Russia had recovered and was able to intervene.
It did so in concert with the Syrian Arab Army, Iran and Hezbollah to save the day – much to the evident chagrin of those who, like Gavin Williamson, prefer to see countries in ashes rather than independent of Western hegemony.
As to the facile nonsense about Russia trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit, both countries happen to share a border with Russia and both countries, in recent years, have been used by the UK and its allies as cat’s paws with the eastward expansion of NATO in mind.
It gets worse though: “The Alliance must develop its ability to handle the kind of provocations that Russia is throwing at us.
Such action from Russia must come at a cost.”
“Provocations,” the man said.
Since British troops have been taking part in exercises on Russia’s doorstep, not the other way round, one wonders if Gavin Williamson wrote this speech while inebriated.
It is Russia that has been on the receiving end of repeated provocations from NATO member states such as the UK in recent times, and it is Russia that has been forced to respond to protect its own security and that of its people where necessary.
Furthermore, not only in Russia but everywhere, including the UK, people understand that when you have political leaders intoxicated by their own national myths and propaganda to such an extent as Britain’s Defence Secretary, danger ensues.
Read more
The most enduring of those national myths where London is concerned is that the British Empire was a force for good rather than a vast criminal enterprise, that Britain and America won the Second World War together alone, that Iraq had WMDs, and that international law and international brigandage really are one and the same thing.
Perhaps the most preposterous section of the speech came when Mr Williamson tried to fashion a connection between Brexit and Britain’s military strength: “Brexit has brought us to a moment.
A great moment in our history.
A moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass.”
Reading this, you can almost hear Churchill turning in his grave.
Britain’s wartime prime minister had such as Gavin Williamson in mind when he famously said, “He has all the virtues I dislike, and none of the vices I admire.”
Mr Williamson obviously misread the memo talking up not the opportunity for increased conflict with China after Brexit but trade.
This was not a speech it was a linguistic car crash, one that will forever command an honoured place in compendiums of the worst political speeches ever made.
As for Gavin Williamson, just as no responsible parent would ever dream of putting an 10-year old behind the wheel of car to drive unsupervised, no responsible British government would ever appoint a man like him as its Defence Secretary.
In years past, he would have struggled to find employment polishing the brass plate outside the building.

Donald Trump and the First Lady of the United States didn't appear to be fazed after Robert Mueller handed over his report on the president's Russia connections Friday.
POTUS and Melania Trump were grinning from ear-to-ear as they posed for a photo opportunity with Caribbean leaders in Florida as the world waited for a reaction to the probe being officially complete.
Standing on the steps of Trump's beloved vacation spot, spectators waited for some indication the Special Counsel news may have stirred them.
Scroll down for videos
Melania and Donald Trump hosted Caribbean leaders at Mar-a-Lago, Florida on Friday
The president and First Lady appeared on the same day Robert Mueller handed in his report on possible Trump collusion election with Russia
While her husband is under intense scrutiny, all eyes were on Melania during the photo call.
Melania wore a linen silk dress from UK brand LK Bennett featuring distracting bold orange, white and black Aztec-inspired prints.
The cinched-in-at-the-waist 'Andrea' round-neck occasion dress is currently on sale for $282.50, down from $565.
Melania paired the midi-length half price frock with Christian Louboutin heels.
The First Lady had a breezy attitude as she took to social media to speak about her day with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Haiti President Jovenel Moise, Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet, Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, and Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.
'Enjoyed hosting the leaders & their delegations,' she posted on Twitter about the day at West Palm Beach.

Minnis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas
Earlier Trump had shared a video on Twitter from inside his meeting.
Making no mention of the Mueller report, he posted: 'Today in Florida, @FLOTUS and I were honored to welcome and meet with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia!'

832947852,"Top 10 Propagandists Who Pushed Russia Collusion Hoax

Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his final report to Attorney General William Barr, marking the official end of the investigation — and with no further indictments on the way.
Although it is not yet known what is in the report, and it could still contain information damaging to the administration, the revelation that there will be no new indictments suggests that the Russia collusion theory is a bust.
Yet since the summer of 2016, there were countless pushers of the narrative that President Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, specifically by conspiring with Russia to steal and distribute stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
This included anonymous current and former officials and those in the media willing to publish their allegations, friends of those officials, Democrat members of Congress, those wanting to promote themselves, and of course, Clinton and her campaign officials.
Here are ten of the top promoters of the narrative:
CNN — CNN first reported that President Trump was briefed on the “pee dossier,” which prompted BuzzFeed to publish the dossier in full.
CNN has also given vast amounts of airtime to analysts, former officials, and Democrat lawmakers pushing the Russia collusion narrative.
It has also published a number of stories that advanced the narrative, including several that turned out to be false.
BuzzFeed — BuzzFeed first published the “pee dossier” in full — which released to the public unfounded accusations against President Trump, including the unverified claim that he hired prostitutes to urinate on a bed during a visit to Moscow in 2013.
At the time of publish, the dossier remained “salacious and unverified,” in then-FBI Director James Comey’s own words.
The Washington Post — The Washington Post was on the forefront of publishing anonymously-sourced stories suggesting collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials.
It published the intelligence leak that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak that led to his firing later.
Flynn ended up pleading guilty to one count of lying.
There were no collusion charges.
The New York Times — The New York Times published a front-page, top-of-the-page story on Inauguration Day suggesting that President-elect Trump’s associates had been “wiretapped.” Though the report admitted, “It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself,” it set the very inauguration of President Trump as part of a Russian conspiracy.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) — Schiff, now the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been the No.
1 pusher of the Russia collusion hoax in Congress.
Absent any direct evidence of collusion, Schiff has argued for months that the evidence is “hiding in plain sight.” Schiff has also tried to fundraise off of the hoax.
Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) — Lieu has been a close second to Schiff’s promotion of the Russia hoax in Congress.
He once called for a pause in the “entire Trump agenda” until an investigation into the collusion ties was completed.
Benjamin Wittes — Wittes, a journalist who is close to former FBI Director James Comey, was a lead inciter on Twitter of the Russia hoax, infamously tweeting cannon gifs every time a new sensational report came out that advanced the Russia collusion narrative.
Louise Mensch — Mensch, a former British parliamentarian, has become a household name among the anti-Trump resistance in the U.S., with her fantastical tweets about “sealed indictments” and grand juries.
Hillary Clinton — Clinton, the day after losing the election to Trump, wanted to promote the idea that Comey’s reopening of the investigation into her emails and Russia led to her defeat, according to the book Shattered.
“She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” a Clinton ally told the book’s authors.
Robby Mook — Mook was the first Clinton campaign official to go on record suggesting there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, during an ABC News interview at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, shortly after stolen DNC emails were released.

830359423,"Blackmail, Balderdash, and the Brexit

After a lot of drama, British Prime Minister Theresa May came back from Brussels with a breakthrough on Brexit.
Only it wasn’t.
While the changes to the protocol that governs the implementation of the Irish Backstop are an improvement they are far fro enough to allay the rightful fears of Brexiteers and the Northern Irish.
From the beginning of this process, the EU has been in blackmail mode.
They’ve made it clear that they would not negotiate in good faith or even at all.
That much has been clear.
The biggest question has been whether May herself was working in the British people’s best interest or was she simply a stalking horse for further EU integration of the entire continent of Europe.
Never forget that the EU has imperial ambitions.
Those that have been its architects saw it as regaining the mantle of the center of the world as the U.S. bankrupts itself maintaining an empire around the world, fighting against the rise of Russia and China.
It sits in the weeds, making byzantine bureaucratic law and building both a fiscal and political union through these under-handed back doors.
Secret Empires: How th... Peter Schweizer Best Price: $5.19 Buy New $8.24 (as of 12:00 EDT - Details)
And the people of Europe have woken up to it.
The Brits voted to leave the EU because of this.
Euroskeptic parties are rising across Europe.
The latest rebuke of the EU came in Austria’s Salzburg, a traditional center-left stronghold just voted for a Lega-style nationalist/populist majority.
Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.
This point cannot be understated.
Because it is the model for how the EU will fight the rising opposition to its rule.
The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.
It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.
It was designed to cause irreparable damage to the U.K. with the long-term effects of destroying the majority political parties and fanning separatist instincts in Wales and Scotland.
And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no-deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.
Poll after poll shows overwhelming rejection of May’s Merkel’s deal as well as growing support for a No-Deal Brexit.
And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.
Businesses are relocating, shipments are stopping, etc.
All because of Brexit, they argue.
No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.
Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.
Theresa May’s performance in parliament before the latest vote was almost convincing.
But, as always, when someone is giving you an ultimatum, my way or the highway, it’s masking an alternative choice.
The Dublin Unionist Party and the European Research Group within the Tories understand this.
I suspect in his heart of hearts Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn
And the reason for this is May was always on their side.
It’s not a negotiation when there’s only one side represented.
This is why Juncker et.al.
refused to negotiate in any meaningful way.
They didn’t have to.
Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details)
And that is simply blackmail.
What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.
Because any organization that would blackmail rather than negotiate is not an organization anyone decent person would want to be a member of.
Fears over a No-Deal Brexit are overblown.
If these same MP’s that are so worried about the uncertainty created by the Brexit process would simply end that uncertainty by backing No-Deal then certainty would return.
It might not be the certainty that is the easiest to swallow for both sides but it will be certainty.
Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.
That’s an insult and it should be treated as such by Parliament.
But it won’t be as MP’s roll over, show Juncker their bellies and hand-wring about how unfair it all is again later this week.
They cannot see the bigger picture that it is the EU that has the weak hand, not them.
They are too blinded by ideology and fear to see that.

813714967,"Brexit Entangles Issue of Iranian Migrants Crossing English Channel

This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com
Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff
Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
Brexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff

Migrants from France arriving in Dover, England, this week (SPLASH)
It is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.
Britain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.
Now the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.
The problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).
Ireland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as “The Troubles,” which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.
It has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the “Brexiteers” (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier-free border.
So that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.
So there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:
“Crashing out of the EU” – a no-deal Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan.
Killing the whole Brexit thing.
Kicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.
There is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no-deal Brexit.
In my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.
I had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two-year notice on March 29, 2017.
However, in the last few months, an E.U.
court has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two-year negotiation.
So that is an option.
However, if Britain’s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.
The whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.
regulations, E.U.
taxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
In the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.
This plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.
However, few people like Theresa May’s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.
That brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.
It is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.
would agree to extend the March 29 date.
That would give time for more debate.
Some people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.
The problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.
Would it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?
Or would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?
So really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to “fudge,” or to kick the can down the road.
Bloomberg (20-Dec) and Independent (Ireland) and Guardian (London, 17-Dec) and UK News (17-Dec)
Big upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians
A big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.
There are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants €15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.
At the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.
However, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.
This is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.
It is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.
border force has been patrolling the waters.
But political pressure has forced Britain’s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.
Many of the migrants are from Iran.
This is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa-free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.
More than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.
The trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross-currents can make the trip much longer.
The trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.
If a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.
When a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.
Iranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran’s human rights record.
For that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.

833028146,"Schiff on end of Mueller probe: 'We have to find the truth'

Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said about a month ago the ""evidence"" of Trump collusion with Russia was ""in plain sight.
""Chairman Burr must have a different word for it,"" Schiff told host Dana Bash on ""State of the Union,"" pointing to communications between Russia and Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump aides George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.
""You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence,"" Schiff said, adding, ""There is a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.""
If there's ""evidence in plain sight"" for Russian collusion, then Mueller is either blind or in cahoots with Trump, because the special counsel isn't indicting anyone else.
But Schiff is nothing if not tenacious.
He is vowing to continue the investigation.
""We will find the truth,"" he told Wolf Blitzer of CNN.
Today, Schiff and numerous other politicians, pundits, and various left-wing loons are still digging through that manure pile looking for the pony they are certain is there.

817449755,"Derbyshire Cheers For Hard Brexit | Blog Posts

The fuss about Brexit over in the U.K. is of only indirect interest to us Americans, but it does show another aspect of the slow political revolution taking place all over the Western world.
As our own correspondent Robert Henderson posted here at VDARE.com on Thursday, the Brexit vote of June 2016—the vote by British people to leave the European Union—was of a piece with the election of Donald Trump five months later.
Both events represented a revolt by ordinary citizens against entrenched Deep State elites and their media, corporate, and academic shills.
Two-plus years on, it's clear on both sides of the Atlantic that those entrenched elites were more entrenched than the revolutionaries supposed.
Both in the U.S.A. and Britain, they have put up a mighty resistance to the loss of their power and influence.
So which revolution is doing better, ours or theirs?
On the evidence of this week, I'd have to say Britain's is ahead.
British Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated a deal with the EU, a package of conditions under which Britain could finally leave the EU on March 29th.
It was a lousy deal for the Brits, keeping the nation chained to the EU bureaucracy in a hundred ways.
""BINO"" I called it back in December—Brexit in Name Only.
Robert Henderson prefers BRINO, and I'm okay with that: the perception is the same.
Tuesday this week Britain's parliament finally got to vote on Mrs May's deal.
They voted it down.
That generated a mini-crisis as the opposition party in parliament called a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
That vote, however, went Mrs May's way, so she remains in power.
But since parliament's rejected her deal, what are the terms under which Britain will leave the EU on March 29th?
A strong possibility now is: no terms.
This is the so-called ""hard Brexit.""
Britain just walks out, leaving the bureaucrats and businessmen to sort things out among themselves as best they can.
There would be chaos and confusion; but, as Adam Smith said, there's a deal of ruin in a nation.
The Brits have faced far worse within living memory.
When the dust settled they'd have their sovereignty back, and could set their own laws in their own parliament for their own people again.
That would be worth a bit of chaos.
A great many Brits agree.
Here's a sound clip from last week.
It's from a weekly show on BBC-TV called Question Time, in which a panel of pundits and politicians takes questions from a studio audience.
This being the BBC the panels are slanted left-liberal, making it usually a pretty dull show.
This Thursday's Question Time panel, however, included political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.
Following those earlier events of the week, the question of course came up: Is there now any alternative to a ""hard Brexit""?
Ms Oakeshott took the question.
Here's what she said:
Oakeshott: Well, the answer … look, I can save everybody a lot of time here …

Emcee: Oh, do!
Because it's been two years, so, so, …

Oakeshott: The short answer is: No, there isn't.
And that is why it seems to me the only option for Theresa May now—and I'm going to admit that it is a sub-optimal position—is to walk away.
That is all she can do.

Emcee: So to leave with no deal.

Oakeshott: Yes, absolutely, because that isn't … (Drowned out by prolonged cheering and applause from the studio audience.)]
Just listen to that studio audience!
Hard Brexit?
They love it!
The TV coverage is even more telling.
They're happy, with the happiness of people who just heard an authority figure—Ms Oakeshott is the privately-educated offspring of an upper-class family—an authority figure taking their side against the elites.
I can't forbear adding that Question Time is a peripatetic show, set in a different city each week.
Thursday's show was set in Derby, which is of course the capital city of Derbyshire …
It's worth adding also that the Brits seem still to have some of their resourcefulness in the face of impending chaos.
The London Daily Mail, January 18th, reports a severe shortage of warehouse space in Britain on account of British firms stockpiling all kinds of goods, including food.
The firms fear that chaos over the absence of customs rules at ports of entry following a hard Brexit will slow down or stop entry of goods.
That's private action, not government action; but I'm reminded of Margaret Thatcher and the crisis with Britain's coal miners in the early 1980s.
When the miners' union leaders first started acting up, Thatcher appeased them with soft talk.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, she called in her Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson and told him to start stockpiling coal.
When the stockpile was big enough, Thatcher turned on the miners and confronted them boldly, from a position of strength.
She was a smart lady, and that's smart government.
You listening, Mr President?

830153674,"Britain’s Attorney General Deals Blow to May’s Rejigged Brexit Deal

Britain’s attorney general has dealt a potentially fatal blow to Theresa May’s rejigged Brexit deal as lawmakers prepare to vote on it later today.
The prime minister returned from Europe late Monday night with what she claimed were “legally binding” changes to the deal that was overwhelmingly rejected last month.
She claims the changes mean the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has published legal advice that shoots down some of her claims.
He writes that if Britain wanted to remove itself from the backstop, it “would have… no internationally lawful means of exiting the [the backstop] arrangements, save by agreement [with the EU].” Support for the rejigged deal likely hinged on Cox’s confirmation that something substantial had changed.
The deal now appears to be heading for its second defeat in the House of Commons.

829267754,"Theresa May Doesn’t Have the Votes

Theresa May still does not appear to have the votes for her deal.
What then?
Extend and PretendEurointelligence says You Really Should Not Take EU’s Willingness to Extend for Granted.
One of the dangers of the Brexit debate is that everybody is making hidden assumptions about what others will do.
One of these assumptions is that the EU would only be too happy to extend the Brexit deadline.
The EU would, of course, extend to give time for ratification of a deal or even to make way for a cross-party deal.
But Theresa May would have to make clear pretty quickly that this is what she wants to do after the meaningful vote goes against her for a second time – which may well happen.
However, the idea that the EU is willing to accept a long extension, or a semi-permanent one, is fanciful for a number of reasons.
The most important relates to power politics within the EU.
The EPP has to be mindful of the impact a long delay would have on the balance of power, especially if it were to expel Viktor Orban.
If the UK were forced to hold European elections in May it would not send a single delegate to the EPP, which means that the EPP’s relative position in the parliament would weaken further.
A long delay would almost certain lead to an outcry among Brexit supporters, and could trigger a groundswell of support for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party.
It appears to us that opposition to May’s deal among pro-Brexit MPs is hardening again – partly based on those delusions.
Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT - Details) If the meaningful vote is negative – as it may well be – we assume that May would at this point try to reach a cross-party agreement to open up the discussion on the future relationship, by giving the House of Commons the right to pass instructions to the government for the post-Brexit negotiations.
At that point, a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
In Brussels, meanwhile, the UK-EU talks are becoming more concrete.
Tony Connelly writes in RTE that the two sides were working on three separate strands: one on the guarantee of the backstop’s temporary nature; a second on the technological solutions that might replace the backstop; and a third on how to change the political declaration.
Negotiations are now in the hot phase – with an agreement due probably on Monday.
We doubt that the two sides would want to give the British press much time to take this deal apart.
Soft Brexit?
Eurointelligence assumes a soft-Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.
But I am not certain what they means by a soft Brexit.
Regardless, unless there is some sort of binding guarantee by the EU as a backstop replacement, one can hardly be certain of anything.
Deal or No Deal?​
Christopher Howarth, a senior research analyst for the House of Commons, says Deal or No deal, Brexit Cannot be Stopped.
Howarth concludes “If the Government brings back the same deal without an exit to the backstop, it will be defeated.
If it is defeated, there will be no second referendum or prolonged stay in the EU.
The UK will leave.
In short, don’t panic: if MPs hold their nerve, we are leaving the EU on 29th March without a permanent backstop.”
In short, Howarth either believes the EU will budge or there will be a no-deal Brexit.
I am not as confident as Howarth but I believe his take is more likely than that of Eurointelligence.
Crunching the Numbers – Guardian
The Guardian did the math as it stands today [March 5 as reported by Eurointelligence] : May needs an additional 110 votes to get the deal through – from a pool of 115 Tory MPs and 40 Labour MPs in leave-voting seats.
There are 7 pro-Remain Tory MPs who said they will vote against the deal without a referendum.
This leaves a total of 148 MPs.
If 10-20 Tory Brexiteers reject the deal, she will need to pick up some 20-30 or so Labour MPs to get it through.
And it seems that the best way to get those Labour MPs lined up would be an open vote on the future relationship, including the option a customs union.
There is no chance of the UK parliament aligning behind any option for so long as Brexit itself has not happened.
But, once it has, the probability of agreement is large simply because the more extreme Brexit options – leave without a deal or re-run the referendum – will have been eliminated.
This is why a two-stage ratification is much more likely to succeed than a once-and-for-all vote.
Convoluted Position
The Eurointelligence position seems more than a bit convoluted.
Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $12.99 Buy New $9.19 (as of 04:05 EDT - Details)
Supposedly, once Brexit happens, leave without a deal will be off the table.
Not Enough Votes
Bloomberg’s Brexit Bulletin concludes Not Enough Votes
Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief whip told the Cabinet on Tuesday he’s not confident he has the numbers to get her exit accord approved next week, and predicted that a defeat would be followed by Parliament forcing the U.K. to maintain closer ties with the European Union.
Julian Smith, the man with the impossible job of manufacturing majorities for May’s Brexit policy, told ministers that the vote will be tight and he doesn’t know which way it’s going to go, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the signals from the Labour camp don’t look good for May.
Labour officials are sounding increasingly upbeat that they will be able to contain the potential voting rebellion in their ranks.
Speaking privately, three officials said they’re confident fewer than 10 Labour lawmakers would vote with May, even though whips have as many as 30 members of Parliament on their list of potential rebels.
The less likely the deal is to pass, the less inclined wavering lawmakers might be to risk their careers to back it.
May’s latest efforts to get Labour MPs on board are falling flat.
Cash handouts for pro-Brexit regions were widely criticized earlier this week and the government’s long-awaited announcement on protecting workers’ rights after Brexit — also aimed at giving Labour MPs an excuse to back the agreement — have been slammed as insufficient.
Meaningful Vote
The first two Bloomberg paragraphs above sound like hogwash and fearmongering by Theresa May.
The second two paragraphs are more realistic.
Unless the EU agrees to modify the backstop in a meaningful way the vote will go down.
If it’s close, then expect May to keep submitting it to vote.
That’s way I don’t have overriding confidence in the opinion of Howarth.
If a vote fails a second time May will put forth an amendment to take no-deal off the Table.
The problem for May and the UK parliament is such a vote is not legally binding.
The UK leaves on March 29 unless the UK parliament passes something the EU agree with.
That’s why I have no confidence in the opinion of Eurointelligence.
Curiously, Eurointelligence says don’t take for granted the EU will extend, yet it fully expects an extension.
I expect one too, but lasting no longer than June.
Otherwise, the UK will be represented in the EU parliament and will make a mess of things.
Malthouse Compromise
I keep returning to the Malthouse Compromise.
It is the one solution that seems to be a reasonable alternative for everyone but the hard remainers.
Under the Malthouse Compromise, Brexit happens and the backstop stays in place for a maximum of two years.
Then and only then is there a hard Brexit, assuming the UK and EU cannot come up with a backstop replacement.
The EU labels this a unicorn.
If the Brexiteers repeatedly hold their ground, I expect something like the Malthouse compromise to win.
Theresa May may resign first, or not.
But if so, Tories are back in the lead in polls, and there is the possibility they can pick a suitable candidate that could get a majority right now.

824684605,"Seven U.K. Labour Lawmakers Quit Over Jeremy Corbyn's Handling of Brexit and Anti-Semitism

LONDON—Britain’s nervous breakdown in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union has mostly been felt by Theresa May and lawmakers in her Conservative party, who have been at each other’s throats for two years as they stumble towards Brexit.
But the main opposition party—Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour—has also been coming apart at the seams.
That became even clearer Monday when seven of its lawmakers, unable to back their left-wing leader on Brexit or the way he’s dealt with anti-Semitism in the party, decided to quit.
Some of the reasons given by the seven members of parliament [MPs] at their dramatic press conference were similar to the bitter arguments which have seen Conservative party politicians angrily fighting amongst themselves.
Namely, a complete disagreement with their leader on how to go forward with the Brexit referendum result.
One of the seven, Chris Leslie, accused Corbyn of a “betrayal” on Europe by helping to enable May's vision of Brexit and refusing to back a second referendum on the issue.
Although he claims he voted to stay in the EU, Corbyn has been a long-time critic of the bloc and many in his party suspect he’s quite happy to see Britain leave.
But it’s the problems unique to Labour that appear to have made the seven most angry and led to the biggest split in the party since the early 1980s.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish MP who’s been a frequent target of anti-Semites in the party, said that she'd come to the “sickening conclusion” that the party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic.”
The Labour party has been plagued by anti-Semitism incidents since Corbyn became leader with the backing of tens of thousands of new left-wing members.
A string of incidents last year saw a joint editorial published by the country’s three most prominent Jewish newspapers claiming that a government led by him would pose an “existential threat” to Jews living in Britain.
Leslie agreed with Berger, saying that Labour been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left,” while another of the seven, Mike Gapes, declared angrily: “I am sickened that Labour is now perceived by many as a racist, anti-Semitic party.”
Berger said she’d become ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay in the party, and added that she felt like she was “leaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation.
I look forward to a future serving with colleagues who respect each other.”
How many of her former colleagues might join her is unclear.
Several MPs who’ve been severely critical of Corbyn since he became leader have issued statements saying that they still think trying to change the party from within is the best way forward, but that Corbyn has to see Monday’s resignations as the final warning.
The seven also made a clear appeal to members of other parties who are uncomfortable with their leaders to join them, with some Conservatives appearing to be open to the idea.
The group, and whoever else joins it, will now sit in House of Commons as a loose group of independent members of parliament rather than as a new party.
The seven rejected comparisons with the Social Democratic Party [SDP] which broke away from the Labour Party in the early 1980s but eventually merged with the Liberal Party.
The SDP is often reviled in Labour history for splitting left-wing voters and helping Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative dominate British politics for a decade.
Another one of the seven, one-time Labour leadership contender Chuka Umunna, declared at the press conference: ""Politics is broken.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Let's change it.”
It’s obvious to anyone with a passing interest in British politics that the current system is broken.
Whether this breakaway can fix it, or indeed if anything can, is far from clear.

833067493,"Don Trump Jr uses Maury Povich paternity meme to mock Democrats

Donald Trump Jr has used a Maury Povich meme to mock Democrats over the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
'Democrats, the test results are back, and Donald Trump is your daddy,' read the text on the image Trump Jr posted on Instagram Saturday, a day after Mueller filed his final report.
Trump Jr added in a comment: '... and your president,' along with three laughing emojis.
The image depicted Povich, whose long running daytime talk show often features startling revelations about love triangles and cheating spouses.
Trump Jr posted the above meme to his Instagram account on Saturday
Trump Jr (seen last year) mocked Democrats saying that the 'test results' show that President Donald Trump is their 'daddy'
It came as President Donald Trump's supporters trumpeted reports that Mueller will seek no additional prosecutions, despite months of feverish predictions that Trump Jr or other close Trump associates would be the next to face indictment.
In the course of the 22-month investigation, Mueller has not charged any American with conspiring with the Russian government to break election laws, and Trump's supporters took word that there would be no further indictments as proof that the collusion allegations were false.
But the contents of the report have yet to be revealed, and Trump's opponents hope they will reveal malfeasance.
Attorney General William Barr is now expected to deliver his summary of Mueller's findings to Congress no sooner than Sunday.
MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was disheartened at the news that Mueller would not seek further indictments.
She is seen above interview Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement that Barr's offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report's conclusions is insufficient and that 'Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents.'
Senator Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump and his core team could still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes.
Trump's business, his charity and his presidential transition operation remain under investigation, Coons said, and congressional Democrats would keep looking into his activities.
'It's the end of the beginning, but it's not the beginning of the end,' Coons told reporters on a telephone conference.

814630609,"Government Sparking ‘Apocalyptic Fears’ over Clean Break from EU

Leading Brexit campaigners have said that the Government is sparking “apocalyptic fears” over the prospect of MPs voting against the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement and the UK making a clean break from the EU.
Writing in a paper published Monday entitled ’30 Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms’, Conservative peer Peter Lilley of Global Britain and Councillor Brendan Chilton of Labour Leave said that to break the House of Commons deadlock over the Irish backstop in Theresa May’s deal the United Kingdom should push for a Canada-style free trade deal.
However, if the EU is unwilling to renegotiate such terms, the Government should leave without a formal agreement — “No Deal” — and revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which Britain is already a member.
Lord Lilley and Cllr Chilton point out that leaving on “WTO+++” terms would mean not only saving £39 billion from the divorce bill envisaged in Mrs May’s deal, but also end the “corrosive economic and political uncertainty” of the two-year transition period, resolve the Irish border issue “by administrative measures without need for a backstop – as all parties have promised in the event of ‘no deal'”, and continue to trade with the EU on zero-tariff rates for up to a decade whilst negotiating a “Canada+++” trade agreement, as permitted under WTO Article 24.
REPORT: May Could Postpone Final Brexit Agreement Commons Vote Again https://t.co/WqOys2SpFn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 6, 2019
The Brexiteers debunked scare stories perpetuated by Remain politicians and establishment media by explaining that in the event of a WTO exit Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC )and the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs MRC (DEFRA) will not need to carry checks on all goods at the border, but only on goods if there is a perceived risk — with HMRC saying it will “prioritise flow over compliance” to prevent long queues at ports.
“Remain campaigners talk of chaos, catastrophe and Armageddon,” the authors wrote, and compared the “apocalyptic fears about leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement” to the hysteria which surrounded the Millenium Bug.
Economist Roger Bootle also wrote in The Telegraph on Sunday that the scare stories surrounding the Brexit debate echo those of europhiles who pushed for Britain to join the Eurozone 30 years ago, when then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, big business, and the mainstream media forecast economic disaster.
“Does this ring a bell?” Mr Bootle wrote.
“It should – an alarm bell.
Now we stand on the brink of another momentous decision.
And the same people are still peddling the same sort of nonsense.”
Mr Chilton and Lord Lilley also criticised broadcasters for “cast[ing] aside their Ofcom obligations to balance and impartiality” by using loaded, anti-Brexit phrases to describe a WTO exit without a Withdrawal Agreement as “falling off a cliff-edge” or “crashing out”.
“In addition, this time the Government is clearly determined to play up the supposed horrors of leaving with no Withdrawal Agreement in the hope of persuading MPs to vote for the EU’s unloved draft ‘deal’.
“The government is in the bizarre position of preparing to leave on WTO terms, while pretending that its preparations will be unsuccessful,” they added.
Members of Parliament are returning to the House of Commons this week to begin debating Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, with one Cabinet source saying “no-one at the moment thinks she will win the vote.”

830359136,"The Fight for Brexit

To see how serious the political elite’s war on Brexit has become, consider this: Tony Blair has been having secret talks with French president Emmanuel Macron on how to prevent Brexit from becoming a reality.
Apparently, Blair has told Macron to ‘stand [his] ground’ against any kind of so-called Hard Brexit and to use his clout, and the EU’s clout, to pressure Britain to stay in the Customs Union and maybe even to hold a second referendum.
To put this in plain, blunt English: a former British prime minister is conspiring with a foreign power to try to subvert the will of the British people.
In normal times, this would be a scandal of epic, epoch-defining proportions.
There might have been riots, certainly protests.
Blair would have been publicly shamed, possibly exiled.
His name would live in infamy.
But we don’t live in normal times.
We live in an era in which most of the political class has ditched even the pretence of feeling a strong attachment to democracy.
An era in reactionary anti-democratic sentiment is more casually expressed than at any other time in living memory.
An era in which the chattering classes nonchalantly call for the overthrow of the largest vote in British history (the vote for Brexit), in which parliamentarians explicitly pit themselves against the people’s will, and in which anyone who so much as raises a peep about any aspect of this polite tyranny will be slammed as a hard-right menace to public life.

And so there is no widespread outrage over the fact that a former British PM is meeting with a tinpot Jupiterian who has subjected his own people to months of extreme violence.
No frontpage denunciations of this Brit who has sided with the most violently repressive leader in Europe to try to ensure that the largest number of voters in British history don’t get what they want.
Indeed, I bet that if anyone were to suggest that Blair is a traitor, they would be railed against.
And yet, look up the word traitor in the dictionary.
‘A person who stops being loyal to their own country.’ What more apt description is there of a powerful Briton who is working with a foreign power to thwart the British people’s political desires?
‘How DARE you call us traitors?
!’ – Remainer elitists do protest too much.
The Blair / Macron love-in is in some ways a better snapshot of where Britain is at right now than what will happen in parliament this week.
For it reveals a bigger, more important truth than the parliamentary tussles over customs unions and delays to Article 50 do.
It confirms that the crisis facing Britain right now is not a technical one of how to leave the EU and whether leaving the EU will cause economic difficulty.
Rather, it is a crisis of democracy.
It is a situation in which the very democratic premise upon which modern Britain has been built – at least since 1928, when all adults, including women under 30, got the right to vote – is being called into question.
The scrapping over ‘how’ we Brexit disguises the far more profound question that has been thrown up by the British masses’ disobedient vote to Leave in June 2016.
Which is this – do the people rule or do they not?

With the Parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan set to be held next month; President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has criticised the UK’s preparations for their departure from the EU.
But is there any chance that May's deal will make it through parliament and if it fails, how could this ongoing political deadlock finally come to an end?
Sputnik spoke with political campaigner Michael Swadling for more…

There is a chance; as unfortunately there are many MPs who don't respect the vote and may just turn on it, but short of that I don't see any way the Conservatives would vote for it, and the majority is slender as it is, as the DUP is bitterly against it, and I can't see the Lib Dems voting for it, so it will only be if there are enough, what I can describe as remoaner MPs, that the deal won't be dead in the water.
Sputnik: What could be a solution to the political chaos if the Prime Minister's deal is not approved?
Michael Swadling: The EU withdrawal act is in place; we'll leave and revert to WTO terms and that works, that's fine.
I often use the example of an iPhone to people; that's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China, uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms, this isn't a fantasy, stuck in a port somewhere, there isn't a massive tariff, this is the world that really exists today.

Norway proposed legislation on Friday to secure the rights of Norwegians living in Britain and of Britons living in Norway in case of a no-deal Brexit, the Justice Ministry in Oslo said.
While Britain and EU-outsider Norway agreed last year to apply the principles of a Brexit agreement in their bilateral relationship, the new legislation would also cover a no-deal scenario.
“We hope Britain will have an orderly exit from the EU.
We must however be prepared for Britain choosing to leave the EU without a deal,” said Justice Minister Tor Mikkel Wara.
If approved, the legislation would delegate power from the non-EU nation’s parliament to the government, allowing it to protect citizens’ rights, Reuters said.

824350729,"‘Go join Farage’s new party’: Tory minister lashes out at Rees-Mogg’s ‘treacherous’ Brexiteers

A Tory cabinet minister has launched a scathing attack on hardline Brexiteer faction, the ERG, after claiming they “drank champagne to celebrate” PM May’s deal being defeated – telling them to defect to Nigel Farage’s new party.
In an interview for The House magazine, business minister Richard Harrington accused the European Research Group, headed by prominent backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg of “treachery,” claiming that in his “view they’re not Conservatives.”
Also on rt.com May mocked after claiming 'I wanted Brexit sorted by Christmas,' as SNP’s Blackford calls her a liar
Harrington, who voted ‘remain’ in the 2016 EU referendum, and has himself intimated that he would be willing to quit May’s cabinet if no-deal Brexit became government policy urged ERG members to join a party that was more in line with their vision for the UK.
“I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called ‘Brexit’ and if I were them I’d be looking at that, because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative Party does,” Harrington suggested.
The government minister was giving his views in the aftermath of Theresa May losing a vote (303-258) on her Brexit deal, that sought to give her more time to negotiate with the EU, changes to the contentious Irish backstop.
The ERG abstained on the vote, with its deputy chairman, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister claiming they couldn’t back something that took “no-deal off the table.”
May’s defeat last night, albeit on a vote that was legally non-binding, has triggered a Tory civil war with cracks appearing within the PM’s cabinet, specifically on the issue of taking the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal – off the table.
Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Britain is prepared to leave the bloc without a divorce deal, insisting the only way to avoid such a scenario is for the UK parliament to vote for May’s Brexit agreement.
No.
We won’t.
We are not leaving without a deal.
If you want to leave, you’d better agree one.

However, foreign office and international development minister, Alistair Burt, has lambasted such suggestions, taking to social media to claim: “We are not leaving without a deal,” in a reply to former Brexit Secretary David Davis.
The PM’s defeat on Thursday night was her 11th on Brexit in 14 months.
It further adds to the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and arguably undermines her pledge to EU leaders that she would be able to gain a good majority of MPs to support her deal.

816720060,"Brexit: Goodbye United Kingdom, hello dis-United Kingdom

To grasp the real meaning of Brexit is to understand the history of a state born in mercantilism and sustained by centuries of empire and colonialism.
Chaos everywhere, consensus nowhere has and continues to define Britain’s stalling and tortuous attempt to depart the EU in an orderly fashion.
Such chaos should come as no surprise, however, because more than a harbinger of Britain’s departure from the EU, Brexit is a harbinger of the break-up of the UK.
Let me explain.
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to give the UK its Sunday name, is the epitome of an artificial state.
It was and remains the product of the grafting together of divergent cultures, histories and national identities.
At inception, this grafting together was undertaken not in the interests of its peoples but in the interests of national elites eager to take advantage of the commercial opportunities of a unified polity with added manpower and resources in an age of empire.
The venality, greed and corruption of the Scottish ruling class in the late 17th- early 18th century delivered the Scottish people into the arms of the union with England without their support, establishing thereby the Kingdom of Great Britain.
This was reflected in the social unrest and riots that ensued in Scottish towns and cities both during the negotiations that brought into being the 1707 Act of Union, and upon its passage.
Read more
For the ruling elites of both Scotland and England the union of both parliaments into one had demonstrable commercial and strategic benefits.
The former had been left bankrupt after Scotland’s failed attempt at establishing its own overseas colony in Darien, Central America (modern day Panama) in the late 17th century.
In order to forestall national immiseration the need to gain access to England’s overseas colonies was thereafter considered essential.
Meanwhile the English were eager to prevent the possibility of Scotland being used as a staging ground for an invasion from the north by the French in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14).
Wales, the third nation that makes up the UK, had already been merged with England in 1536.
Ireland on the other hand was a subjugated English (latterly British) colony, and was officially brought into the orbit of what would then be known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.
In 1922, after a prolonged national liberation struggle in Ireland, the 26 counties that make up today’s Republic of Ireland achieved dominion status before winning full independence in 1948, while the remaining six counties that make up the entire island, or Ireland, were partitioned to become what is now Northern Ireland: hence the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of today.
This necessary historical detour out of the way, here is where things start to bear relevance to Brexit.
An unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution that saw Britain (UK) go on to forge an empire which at its height covered a quarter of the globe, was the forging of a unified working class whose unity transcended national, cultural and regional differences.
This class unity was the product of the country’s heavy industries – coal mining, steel, shipbuilding, etc.– and was expressed in common economic interests and struggles against a common enemy, the bosses and owners of those industries, in the context of the trade union movement..
It also began to manifest politically with the formation of the Labour Party at the start of the 20th century.
In tandem, forged over time, was a British national identity nourished by the countless wars the state’s ruling elite unleashed and waged over the centuries of an empire that existed not to spread civilization and modernity to the ‘dark peoples’ of the planet, as officially claimed, but as a juggernaut of exploitation, subjugation and oppression.
In those countless colonial wars working class men were used as cannon fodder in a dynamic that continues to the present day.
Read more
Margaret Thatcher destroyed this material basis of working class unity across the UK in the 1980s.
Her free market counter-revolution and resulting deindustrialization of the nation’s economy turned Britain into what it is today – a service economy underpinned by financialized capital.
The country’s trade union movement, which once wielded considerable economic and political clout, is but a shadow of its former self as a consequence, while the Labour Party was gutted of its founding principles by Tony Blair and his execrable centrist crew in the 1990s and on into the first decade of the noughties.
It is the remnants of this Blairite crew within the Labour Party who have and continue to be engaged in a concerted effort to undermine the party’s current socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Such people, working alongside a reactionary Tory establishment, should be careful what they wish for.
Because in 2019 it is only Corbyn’s socialist program, offering economic and social transformation, that provides any hope of repairing the regional, national and cultural fault lines that correspond to the breakdown of the 2016 EU referendum vote.
The post-industrial north and midlands of England, parts of the country virtually untouched by investment and left without hope after being decimated by Thatcher, voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in a veritable scream from the bowels of austerity Britain.
Every one of Scotland’s 32 local authorities, meanwhile, voted Remain.
Wales, particularly post-industrial south Wales, voted for Brexit, while a five percent majority in Northern Ireland voted Remain.
It confirms that what was once the United Kingdom is now the dis-United Kingdom, with those previously mentioned national and regional differences informing its peoples’ identities and worldview over the identity of class to an extent previously unseen.
Brexit in this context is a sideshow, a pantomime largely being played out in parliament and the centrist mainstream.
As Karl Marx put it: “To call upon people to give up their illusions about their condition, is to call upon them to give a condition that requires illusions.”
The illusion that Brexit is actually relevant to the needs of those who’ve seen their lives devoured by the beast of neoliberalism and bludgeoned by austerity must soon give way to the unvarnished truth that the UK as we know it, is past its sell-by date

“A reactionary,” the great postwar Labour figure Nye Bevan once said, “is a man walking backwards with his face to the future.” Surveying a political class presently engaged in ripping itself apart over Brexit, who could argue otherwise?

813602345,"New year ushered in with fireworks and European solidarity

The words “London is open” rang in the new year as the capital welcomed 2019 with a dazzling riverside fireworks display.
The phrase was spoken in seven languages around two minutes past midnight as the city skyline filled with lights in the largest annual display in Europe.
A soundtrack featuring Europe’s finest musical artists celebrated the diversity of the capital, after Big Ben, silent for much of 2018 due to renovations, chimed once more.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the sold-out display would show Europe that the capital will remain “open-minded” and “outward looking” post-Brexit.
He said Westminster politicians had given the world the impression that Britain is “insular, inward looking”, as Britain begins the new year countdown to Brexit.
Fireworks light up the sky over the London Eye (Victoria Jones/PA)
Mr Khan said he hoped this year’s event would “send a message of support” to the more than one million European citizens for whom London is home.
He has previously expressed his backing for a People’s Vote and has voiced his concerns over the effects of a no-deal Brexit on the capital.
Speaking to the Press Association on New Year’s Eve, he said: “Well one of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression we’re insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans.”
The display lit up London (Yui Mok/PA)
“I think the Government’s made a mess of negotiations with the European Union,” Mr Khan continued.
“Bearing in mind Parliament can’t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government,” he said.
He vowed that London would remain the same after March 29 2019, and said the fireworks display was about “showing the world, while they’re watching us, that we’re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic”.
Some 100,000 ticket-holders lined the banks of the Thames to watch 70,000 projectiles made up of eight tonnes of fireworks fire into the sky from three barges and the London Eye.
Huge crowds saw the spectacular show (Yui Mok/PA)
Mr Khan continued: “We, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world, one of the reason we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans.”
“I think diversity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that diversity.
“I hope that members of Parliament, members of the Government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March.”

822220578,"UK Labour Leader Corbyn Losing Support Over Failure to Take a Stance on Second Brexit Vote

Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Houses of Parliament in London on January 29, 2019.
(Photo by Jack Taylor/Getty Images)
London (CNSNews.com) – At the online Labour Party shop, you can still buy a spiffy T-shirt emblazoned with the picture of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, looking sober and determined.You can also purchase a Corbyn tote bag, mug, framed print – and the official Jeremy Corbyn pint glass, which can hold a liberal amount of beer.
However, these wares might not be flying off the virtual shelf so quickly these days, as a handful of polls indicate that Britain’s main opposition party is suffering as a result of its ambivalent stance towards a second vote on leaving the European Union.
The 69-year-old Corbyn, a veteran lawmaker on the party’s far left who beat the odds to become its leader in 2015, has long been popular among younger voters, who helped propel him to near victory in the 2017 general election.
Since then, he has refused to fully back calls for a second Brexit referendum, calling it merely one of the “other options” available, in case Britain’s planned withdrawal from the E.U.

next month goes badly.CCorbyn wrote a public letter to Prime Minister Theresa May this week, outlining what kind of agreement Labour would support with the E.U.
post-withdrawal.It included a customs union and a generally close relationship with the E.U., but was silent on the question of second referendum.
In a recent survey by Opinium, 22 percent of young Labour voter respondents indicated they could move away from the party on the grounds it hasn’t done enough to stop the planned exit.
A YouGov poll in December found similarly that support for Labour among 18 to 29-year-olds would drop from 60 to 33 percent if the party supported Brexit in any form.
British media outlets this week published parts of a leaked private report drawn up for a Labour-allied trade union, which reportedly described failure to oppose Brexit as more damaging to the party than its support for the Iraq war in 2003.
Meanwhile student leaders have warned that Labour is in danger of losing “millions” of voters.
A front-page advertisement in Corbyn’s local newspaper in London featured a call from more than 100 activists for a public vote.
Chris Stafford, an expert in British politics at the University of Nottingham, said this week Corbyn’s strategy has been to stay in the background while May’s Conservative Party – which has pro- and anti-E.U.
wings – has torn itself apart over Brexit.
But after waiting and biding his time, Stafford said, Corbyn is now under pressure to make his position clear.
“It is hard to criticize the government and say you would do it better while not offering a concrete alternative,” he said.

There has been public talk of a group of lawmakers breaking away from Labour, although Stafford said he doubted a new party would attract that many voters.“When it comes to election day most people stick with one of the bigger parties because they don’t want to ‘waste’ their vote on a different [smaller] one,” he said.
Stafford said while polls suggest Labour is losing support, Corbyn could regain popularity if he takes a stance that makes his party distinct from the Conservatives.
May has pledged not to run again for prime minister.
Stafford said that, while much will depend on who the Tories choose as their next leader, the complete disarray within the Conservative Party will help Corbyn look like a better option.
Call for U.S.-style primaries
This week, a prominent Labour activist called for American-style primaries to be introduced when it came to selecting candidates for parliament.
Aaron Bastani, a writer with links to Corbyn, tweeted that if people thought newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) embodied excellent politics it was important to remember she got into office through a primary.
“We need the best leaders in parliament,” he tweeted.
“Primaries, along with mandatory reselection, is how.”
Currently, candidates in both the Labour and Conservative parties are selected through local party organizations, often with input from the party’s national office.
In 2009, in what was billed as a first, a physician named Sarah Wollaston was selected as a Conservative Party candidate through an open primary held through the mail.
She won, and now sits in the House of Commons representing Totnes in southwest England.
Wollaston said Thursday that the experiment allowed local voters to choose from a wide range of candidates, both experienced politicians and newcomers.
Non party members were allowed to participate as well, in a constituency that has a solid tradition of electing Conservatives.
“In a so called safe seat, open primaries give voters the chance to select a candidate who, if subsequently elected, would at least be nearer their own political views,” she said.
“But the postal method is expensive and I think this has made it difficult to sustain.”

832933796,"Trump Advisers Upbeat: Mueller ‘Doesn’t Have the Goods’

President Donald Trump’s advisers feel upbeat that special counsel Robert Mueller “doesn’t have the goods” to formally accuse the president of colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election or charge that he obstructed justice, according to the Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig.
The comprehensive report, still confidential, marks the end of Mueller’s probe but sets the stage for big public fights to come.
The next steps are up to Attorney General William Barr, to Congress and, in all likelihood, federal courts.
The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be released publicly before long and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery was that he is “glad it’s over,” according to sources close to ABC News.
Barr released a letter noting his plans to write his own account of Mueller’s findings.
The White House released a statement saying it had not seen or been briefed on the special counsel’s document.
What happens next is “up to Attorney General Barr,” said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
Barr said he could send his account to Congress quickly.
“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” Barr said in his letter to top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.
He pledged a commitment to transparency.
The attorney general said the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to Congress to ensure there was no political inference in the independent probe.

830274102,"Theresa May Defeated Again as U.K. ‘Shitshow’ Threatens to Block Brexit

LONDON—It’s 17 days until Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
For just under two years, the British government has diverted all of its energy into hammering out a deal to ensure its exit was as smooth as possible.
On Tuesday night, it appeared that those efforts had amounted to absolutely nothing—and no one knows what happens next.
Despite Theresa May’s desperate 11th-hour attempts to polish her Brexit deal into something acceptable to lawmakers after they rejected it with the most overwhelming government defeat in British parliamentary history in January, the rejigged deal was knocked back again this evening in another whopping, and humiliating defeat—by 391 votes to 242.
The prime minister flew back from Strasbourg late Monday night with what she proudly claimed were “legally binding” changes to her deal.
She said the changes meant the Irish backstop—the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland—could not “become permanent” as anti-EU lawmakers had feared.
She presented the plan to lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday morning—but a familiar disaster befell her.
Clearly feeling the strain of the late-night negotiations, her voice failed her and she croaked and spluttered her way through her crucial chance to sell her deal.
It wasn’t the first time: She famously suffered every keynote speaker’s worst nightmare in 2017 when her voice failed and her backdrop fell to pieces at the Tory party annual conference.
Lawmakers were not convinced by the faltering performance.
Britain’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox published legal advice Tuesday morning which rejected the idea that the changes would allow Britain to legally decide to exit the backstop without the agreement of the EU, potentially forcing it to adhere to the bloc’s customs rules against its will.
The staunchly anti-EU wing of May’s Conservative party, the European Research Group, announced they couldn’t back it.
Then the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party—whose support May relies on for winning votes with her minority government—also disowned it.
Its fate was sealed hours before the results came in on Tuesday evening.
“It’s a shitshow,” one Conservative MP told The Daily Beast.
Another, Sir Mike Penning, said: “It’s reached the stage where we don’t know what the hell is going to happen.”
What happens next doesn’t seem to be clear to anyone.
In the short term, there’s likely to be two more key votes in the House of Commons this week.
One will determine whether Parliament consents to leave the EU with no deal—which, based on previous results, is likely to be rejected.
The other will see lawmakers vote on whether to extend the 29 March 2019 deadline the U.K. set itself to leave the EU nearly two years ago.
That result is harder to predict as even lawmakers who think it’s a good idea will face a backlash from some constituents who will accuse them of trying to abandon the entire Brexit project.
What happens in the longer term is anyone’s guess.
Lawmakers are talking about a number of scenarios: a third vote on May’s deal either before or after a deadline extension; the highly uncertain scenario of leaving with no deal; or taking it to the public with a second referendum, or even a general election.
In one scenario forecast by Tory grandee Sir Charles Walker, May will now be forced to call a general election to try and end the impasse.
The vice chairman of the influential Conservative 1922 Committee said the administration had dissolved into chaos and—for the first time in at least a century—Britain’s government was incapable of functioning.
“If it was a horse with a broken fetlock, this Parliament, you’d probably put it down,” he said on Sky News.
There is also frustration among the more pragmatic MPs who feel the prime minister has done everything she can to compromise with the pro-Brexit lawmakers, and their intransigence is now the only thing that could prevent Brexit entirely.
One possibility—if all other options such as no deal or a deadline extension are ruled out—is that the deal is voted on a third time and, faced with prospect no Brexit happening at all, it’s passed.
“The reality is Brexiteer MPs need to come on board,” Paul Masterton MP told The Daily Beast.
“If they don’t, then they are putting their precious project at risk.
This is as Brexity as it’s going to get for them.
If the deal is defeated then all bets are off.""
One of the few Conservative MPs who fell in behind May on Tuesday night after previously voting against the deal said he was partly motivated by the new concessions from Brussels but “more importantly if we don’t, there’s a good chance we won’t get any form of Brexit at all.”
Penning, who helped run May’s leadership campaign, had previously described the prime minister’s deal as “dead as a dodo” but he told The Daily Beast he had changed his mind because he feared his parliamentary colleagues would vote later this week “to block hard Brexit, which means we’ve got no negotiating position; so we’re stuffed—in this limbo forever and a day.”
However, Penning rejected Walker’s suggestion of a general election.
“Charlie is entitled to his opinion but firstly you need two-thirds of the House to vote for it, that ain’t gonna happen,” he said.
Penning dismissed speculation that No.
10 had encouraged Walker to go rogue in TV and radio studios ahead of the vote in order to try and scare a few more Conservatives into backing the prime minister.
“You don’t know Charlie Walker; he’s a very independently minded MP.”
In a bid to stave off an earlier defeat, May was forced to accept that if her deal was rejected for a second time, she would allow MPs to hold a vote the following day on whether they would accept a no-deal Brexit.
Since the triggering of Article 50—Britain’s formal request to leave the EU—a two-year countdown to March 29, 2019, began.
According to legislation passed by the House and still on the books, Britain will automatically plunge out of the EU in 17 days even if there is no withdrawal agreement.
A large majority of MPs believe that would be extremely damaging to Britain as decades of trade deals, cross-border agreements, regulations and rights would disappear in a puff of smoke.
It is therefore likely that the House of Commons will vote against no deal, that prospect increased when May reacted to her defeat by declaring that there would be a “free vote”—that means the government effectively does not even have a policy on one of the most important votes in a generation.
If Parliament does reject no-deal Brexit, another vote would be automatically triggered for Thursday.
This time the question put to lawmakers will be: Should Britain request a delay to Brexit?
It is much harder to predict how that vote would play out as both of the main party leaders have effectively lost control of their MPs and would not be able to enforce the party whip.
Substantial numbers of politicians on both sides believe delaying Brexit would be an insult to the electorate who voted to quite the EU in 2016; while similarly large numbers believe no deal must be avoided at all costs.
There is also a smaller group of MPs who are plotting to hold a second referendum and would therefore vote for as long a delay to Brexit as possible.
For once May captured the mood of the House of Commons late Tuesday night when she said: “These are unenviable choices.
Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”
Whatever Britain wants to do next, with 17 days to go until its membership of the European Union expires, it’s time to make a decision.

813992175,"Dreadful Brexit Deal: All EU States Could Ask UK For Trading Concessions - Prof

Barely two days have passed since the New Year and the remoaners are doing what they do best.
Fear mongering.
Unfortunately the British Parliament appears to be infested with them, as there is speculation that the government will begin a publicity campaign, aiming to warn of potential adverse effects of a no deal departure.
But would this outcome be as bad as so often claimed in the mainstream media?
And would it be preferable to Prime Minister Theresa May’s much maligned Chequers plan?
Sputnik spoke with UKIP founder Alan Sked for more insight on the issue.
Sputnik: Does Theresa May have any chance of passing her Brexit deal?
And why is it so bad?
Alan Sked: It’s very difficult for her to pass it because it is very bad, as we have to pay the EU thirty nine billion pounds and we don’t get very much in return.
It sets up a two year transition period, during which we, in effect; remain members of the EU, but we don’t have any say in decision maker’s decisions that they take, we’d just have to accept whatever rules and regulations they pass without being able to influence or veto them.

Then there’s another thing that says; if we don’t get a free trade agreement by the end of the transition period, we’d enter a thing called the backstop that comes into play to safeguard the Irish border, which means that Britain and Northern Ireland become part of the single market and customs union.
We couldn’t get out of it; it goes on indefinitely and we’ve got no means of unilaterally exiting, we’d have to get the permission of the EU to come out, and if we want that permission, we’d have to get that permission from the twenty seven different countries, and each one of them could ask for trading concessions in order to get their permission, so it’s a dreadful deal.
Sputnik: Are WTO rules now the solution to the ongoing political deadlock?
Alan Sked: WTO’s a perfect solution.
We trade with America, China, India and most of the world under WTO rules already and different parts trade with each other on these rules.
The EU trades with America, China, India and different places on WTO rules; we’re set up to trade with large parts of the world already in that way so it won’t make very much difference.
I’d be very happy with WTO rules.

Alan Sked: They need our economy more because they sell about twice as many goods to us, as we do to them.
We’re its largest trading customer and they need access to the UK market and if they are denied that; then who’s going to buy German cars, French wine, Italian leather goods etc.

They are highly dependent on our market, and I don’t think they realise just how much.

832947600,"Grassley: Attempts to Keep Collusion Narrative Alive Will Harm U.S.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Senate Finance Committee chairman, declared the Russian collusion narrative dead on Friday, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to Attorney General William Barr, with no further indictments planned.
“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries,” the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee said in a statement.He also noted that Mueller has been investigating any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin for “nearly two years now,” and the Justice Department even before the 2016 election.
He also slammed the “millions” in taxpayer dollars and “aggressive surveillance tools” used, with still no evidence of collusion.
“We know that the Russians tried to meddle in our democratic processes to sow divisions, as they have in so many other countries.
But throughout this prolonged investigation, which cost tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and included aggressive surveillance tools, we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion,” he said.
Grassley joined fellow members of Congress in asking for Mueller’s findings to be released, to “finally put an end” to the “speculation and innuendo” that has plagued the administration since its inauguration.
“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.

814403875,"Brexit vote will ‘definitely’ happen, UK’s May says, as new poll shows most Britons would now vote to remain

British Prime Minister Theresa May said a vote on her Brexit deal will ""definitely"" happen next week, even as a new poll shows a majority of Britons would vote to remain in the European Union if there was a second referendum.
""We're going to be in uncharted territory if this deal does not go through,"" May warned in an interview with the BBC.
The British leader said that since the vote was pulled at the last minute in December, she's been consulting with EU leaders and British colleagues to get new assurances in three key areas, the details of which will be laid out in the coming days.
Those three areas include specific measures for Northern Ireland, a greater role for parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future U.K.-EU relations, and further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish backstop.

""When MPs come to look at this vote, they need to ask themselves: Does this deal deliver on the referendum?
Yes, it does.
Does it protect our jobs and security?
Yes, it does.
Does it provide certainty for businesses and citizens for the future?
Yes, it does,"" May explained.
Under forceful questioning from the BBC, May said that there should not be a second referendum.
A new YouGov survey showed that if a second referendum were held now, 54 percent of British citizens would be in favor of remaining in the European Union.
The poll, which was commissioned by People's Vote, an organization pushing for a new referendum, also found 41 percent thought the final decision about Brexit should be made by a new public vote rather than leaving it in lawmakers' hands.
A deal setting out the terms of the United Kingdom's divorce from the EU has been agreed to between the prime minister and the EU, but it must pass a vote in Britain's Parliament before it is formally adopted.
Lawmakers are expected to vote on it either January 14 or 15.
The U.K. is due to leave the EU on March 29.
""Don't' let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good,"" May said.
""I want to see this deal go through.""

829815104,"Brussels Shows Its Fear

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been under fire from the European Union for years for his opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open immigration policy.
A policy which she herself has had to pull back on.
And no matter how far Merkel has changed her stance and acceded to the reality of the damage her policy has created, Orban is still guilty of the sin of non-compliance.
Actually, he’s guilty of a whole lot more than that.
Because Orban has not only stepped on the third-rail of European politics he’s stomped up and down while taking a massive dump on it.
That third-rail, of course, is naming names.
Naming the very person who controls so much of EU policy through his co-opting large swaths of the European parliament.That person, of course, is George Soros.
Now there is a push, ahead of May’s European Parliamentary elections, to kick Orban’s dominant Fidesz party out of the European People’s Party (EPP), a nominal center-right coalition and the largest single party within the EU parliament.
Secret Empires: How th... Peter Schweizer Best Price: $5.19 Buy New $8.24 (as of 12:00 EDT - Details)
And with each victory over Soros Orban grows even bolder.
After a successful re-election campaign predicated on the slogan, “Don’t Let Soros Win,” Orban has banned Soros’ major NGO, Open Society Foundation, as well as forced out his Central European University.
But his biggest sin was equating outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude “When things get tough you have to lie” Juncker with Soros’ attempts to weaken Hungary’s border.
His reward for this, and building a border fence which thwarts Soros and Merkel’s tactic of tying immigrants in the host country in legal limbo for years by being inset from Hungary’s actual border, has been an Article 7 procedure opened up against Hungary for not abiding by the EU’s position on human rights.
Poland is in similar hot water with Merkel but thanks to one of the few reasonable things within the EU’s framework, each country can use the other to veto the actual censuring and concomitant removal of voting rights within the Union that comes with the full application of Article 7.
But this article isn’t really about Orban’s latest troubles with the faux democrats within the EU parliament.
It’s about how scared those people are of the rise in Euroskeptics like Orban across the continent ahead of May’s elections.
Orban’s potential expulsion from the EPP is just another symptom of this fear.
Recently, France’s Marine Le Pen, found out that the trial against her for tweeting out images of ISIS beheadings back in 2015, will go forward with the potential of landing her in jail for three years.
This is not much different than the kidnapping charge Sicilian prosecutors tried to bring against Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of Lega and all-around bad boy Matteo Salvini in Italy.
This was a lame attempt to split Italy’s Euroskeptic coalition and keep it focused on internal trivialities versus mounting a real challenge in May’s elections.
The same is true now for Le Pen.
Her National Rally party is polling within the margin of error of President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche with a real chance to send a plurality of French Euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels in a couple of months.
Merkel is struggling with the same thing.
And even though support for Alternative for Germany (AfD) has waned in recent polling, down to just 13%, don’t underestimate the voters’ desire to send a strong message to Brussels by voting in stronger numbers for the new or alternative parties rather than how they would vote for them at home.
We’ve seen this in the past with UKIP who shocked everyone in the last European elections in 2014 with the size of the vote for them.
It never translated into domestic momentum as typical prisoner’s dilemma concerns are more prevalent in Britain’s majoritarian voting system.
But for the EU parliament where the two-party system doesn’t hold sway and the direct benefits are harder to make a case to voters for, it’s much more likely voters will loosen up a little and throw their support for a smaller, less established party.
And that, along with some serious miscalculations about Brexit which I’ll get to in a minute, has the power elite in European political circles very scared.
So scared that they are willing to devote serious resources in Quixotic endeavors of dubious value.
Expelling Orban from the EPP will only give him more strength.
It will only give Euroskeptics more ammunition.
Orban, like Salvini, revels in being the outsider.
He’ll use it to rally others across Eastern Europe and pull a few more seats into that orbit.
According to the latest polling, which you can find an up-to-date tally of here, Euroskeptic parties will take between 215 and 225 seats out of the 705 up for grabs, assuming Britain actually leaves and doesn’t stand for MEP elections, which at this point doesn’t look likely.
Architects of Ruin: Ho... Peter Schweizer Best Price: $2.90 Buy New $6.54 (as of 11:35 EDT - Details)
If reports are true that Prime Minister Theresa May cut a deal with Merkel in July of last year on the withdrawal agreement.
And if that agreement was structured so as to ease the way for the U.K. to rejoin the EU later are true, then there is no way Mrs. May will be able to forestall Brexit on WTO terms at this point, even if it takes another 90 days to do so.
A report from the Bruges Group, since taken down, had the details (see link above).
And we’ll know if this is the case if suddenly Theresa May agrees to step aside as Prime Minister just after March 29th whether or not Britain leaves.
Because she will have either failed to scuttle Brexit and be sacrificed to save the Tories.
Or she steps aside for a true Brexiteer in the event of Parliament voting for an extension.
We’ll know this was the case if she does so.
Lots of ifs, I know, but right now everyone is doing the Juncker-Two-Step, lying and cajoling to maintain the status quo and continue forward towards further European integration.
Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank did his part, going full dove for the rest of 2019 to keep markets from imploding.
And if Brexit is settled on WTO terms that opens up their worst nightmare going forward.
Watch Viktor Orban smile the smile of the just at that point.

Deep State Strikes Back—And Misses.
Good Omen For Trump?
| Articles

The parallels between British and American politics are simply eerie.
In 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit—and guess what?
Since then, of course, the political classes in both countries have been conspiring to reverse the election results.
But Theresa May just suffered the greatest defeat of any British Prime Minister when her BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by the House of Commons 432-202.
Subsequently, May has survived a vote of No Confidence and the outlook is confused.
But clearly the Deep State has not yet tamed British populism.
A good omen for Trump?
May’s defeat was terrible enough, but it was even worse because the “payroll vote,” of Members of Parliament (= Congressmen) holding government office, is around 140.
Hence, BRINO only attracted around 60 backbenchers (who within reason can vote as they like).
The Spectator has a list, with names, of the 118 Tories to voted against May’s deal.
This gives May and her government a tremendous problem because ever since she came back with the draft deal she has been saying it is her way or the highway, stubbornly insisting that no other deal is available.
But such was the deal’s subordination of UK interests that many commentators argued would leave the UK as a vassal state.
[May’s Brexit deal: the legal verdict | The PM’s plan isn’t bad – it’s atrocious, by Martin Howe QC, Spectator, November 24, 2018]
This fiasco is largely due to having a Remainer PM (May opposed Brexit although she wasn’t brave about it) and a Remainer-dominated cabinet.
At best their heart isn’t in Brexit; at worst they are deliberately trying to sabotage it.
Similarly, many Trump Administration officials and GOP Congressional leaders have been all too obviously hostile to his agenda.
With a Leaver PM and a Leaver-dominated Cabinet, there would still have been a potential problem with Remainer-dominated Houses of Commons and Lords.
But it is doubtful that Remainers in Parliament would have been so blatant in their attempts to frustrate a straightforward Brexit.
The defeat of May’s deal is encouraging for Brexiteers inasmuch as the overwhelming result should have greatly lessened any thoughts May had of coming back with a few insignificant cosmetic changes.
However, it’s still a possibility.
And there are many other threats to thwart a true Brexit.
If there is a serious breakdown of party discipline, there is nothing to stop Remainer MPs doing anything they want because the House of Commons still has a substantial majority of Remainers.
But a bright spot for Brexiteers: the date for the UK’s leaving is fixed in an Act of Parliament.
Section 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal ) Act 2018 states ‘“exit day” means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m.’
To change the date of the UK leaving the EU requires either an amendment to or a repeal of the Act.
And unless the Brexit leaving date is changed, it does not matter what else happens, because there is a legal obligation on the UK to leave.
A second referendum cannot be held, an extension of Article 50 cannot be sought by the UK or granted by the EU and Article 50 cannot be revoked.
In addition Remainers, however aided and abetted by the unethical Remainer Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, cannot ultimately stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March.
There are serious obstacles to the House of Commons voting to amend or repeal the leaving date.
To begin with it would nakedly expose the Remainers’ anti-democratic partisanship.
Ever since the referendum, most Remainers have consistently bleated that they honored the result, although obviously hoping to sabotage Brexit.
Having their true feelings exposed will be more than embarrassing, because there are many constituencies (= Congressional districts), especially ones held by Labour MPs, that voted heavily to leave the EU while their MP voted Remain.
Leave voters might well punish Remainer MPs in Leave constituencies.
Then there is the entirely practical alternative option of a No-Deal Brexit—more precisely, leaving without any negotiated deal with the European Union and proceeding to trade under World Trade Organization rules.
Significant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready-made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.
Of course, WTO membership does not mean that future bilateral trade deals cannot be struck.
So what is really happening—in the U.K. and the U.S.?
The Deep State is often portrayed as a conspiracy.
In fact, it is better thought of as a blind sociological event.
There is no group of conscious conspirators, simply people being groomed to have the same opinions or at least saying they do.
What has happened in the UK (and the rest for the West to varying degrees) is the success of the long march through the institutions.
That is what ultimately has given the UK an elite (politicians, mediafolk, teachers etc) who are overwhelmingly Politically Correct internationalists.
And it’s those people who are at the forefront of the attempts to sabotage Brexit.
How did it come about?
A German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.
Eventually there would be enough of such people to change the policies of Western societies from national to internationalist ones.
That point was reached in the UK at least 50 years ago and the Politically Correct stranglehold on our society is now complete.
The capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has “anti-racism” (in reality anti-white racism) at its heart.
The last brick in the Politically Correct building is the increasingly draconian treatment of anyone who refuses to toe the line—increasingly including the use of the criminal law and imprisonment.
That is why Western politics until recently has been so ideologically monotone.
Brexit was a revolt against that mentality.
Most MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.
But by doing so, MPs forfeited their right to do anything other than honour the result of the referendum.
That applies just as much to Remainer MPs as Leaver MPs.
Sadly, the behaviour of the most committed Remainers with power and influence (including many MPs and peers in the House of Lords) has shattered utterly the idea that the UK is a fully functioning democracy.
Rather, it is an elective oligarchy whereby the electorate are offered an opportunity every few years to choose between competing parts of the elite—an elite in the UK whose general political ideas are largely held in common and go against the interests and wishes of most of the electorate.
None of this should be a surprise.
The sad truth: the central political question in all Western societies is—how far will the masses be able to control the naturally-abusive tendencies of the elite?

813623212,"'Wishful thinking': Tory MPs dismiss May's hopes for change of heart on Brexit deal

Jeremy Hunt insisted Theresa May can still salvage her Brexit deal today - despite Tory MPs branding her hopes of getting it through Parliament 'wishful thinking'.
The Foreign Secretary said he believed the PM will 'find a way' to win the looming Commons vote by getting assurances with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop is only temporary.
But senior Conservatives said they were detecting no sign of a shift in opinion over the Christmas break, warning that 'nothing has changed'.
Brexit hostilities have been resumed with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.
The moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.
The premier used her New Year message to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'.
She said passing the deal would mean the UK can thrive and 'start a new chapter with optimism and hope'.
Mr Hunt added his voice to the pleas today, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'.

Theresa May used her New Year message (pictured) to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'
Senior Tories Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood are among those who have renewed their vow to oppose the Brexit deal
Speaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.
'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.
'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.
'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.
'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'
Mr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.
'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.
'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.
'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'
He also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.
Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.
Mrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.
But the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.
The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.
However, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.
Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.
Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.
And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.
Corbyn at odds with Labour activists over Brexit referendum Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, he said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.
'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.
'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'
Sir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.
'Parliament exists to make our laws.
This Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'
Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.
'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.
'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.
They would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'
Another senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'
They added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...
'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'
Mr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.
He said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.
'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.
'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'
Mr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.

Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang from gatecrashing a party in Mayfair
The Page One headline in the Evening Standard said it all: ‘First Stab Victims Of The New Year.’ Welcome to 2019.
Call me old-fashioned, but when I worked on the Standard, admittedly in prehistoric times, the front page was more likely to feature the first baby born in one of London’s maternity hospitals.
On Wednesday, the photographs were of a security guard and a young mother knifed to death within a few miles of each other.
Tudor Simionov was killed when he tried to prevent a gang dressed in designer clothes from gatecrashing a sordid sex party at an exclusive address in Mayfair.
Charlotte Huggins was murdered in her own home in Camberwell, South London.
Both victims were 33 years old.
Elsewhere, a man was stabbed in the street in Blackheath and was said to be critically ill in hospital.
Mr Simionov had only been in Britain for two months, moving here from Romania with his fiancee in search of a better life.He died at the scene, in Park Lane, after being attacked by up to ten men — including, allegedly, the 26-year-old son of Finsbury Park firebrand Captain Hook, the Islamist hate preacher currently serving life for terrorism offences in an American supermax jail.
His son, Imran Mostafa Kamel, was remanded on firearms charges yesterday and remains a suspect in the murder..
Two other security guards and a woman aged 29 were also stabbed and were treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries.
Flowers left on the pavement outside the entrance of the party in Mayfair, where security guard Simionov was stabbed to death
Park Lane, like the rest of central London, was teeming with drunken revellers seeing in the New Year.
The manager of a local garage said he had called the police to a crowd fighting and menacing his customers a couple of hours before the fatal stabbing.
He said they came and went around 3am.
To be fair, police resources are always stretched at New Year.
But routine foot patrols are thin on the ground at the best of times.
I was at a black tie ball in Park Lane shortly before Christmas.
When I left after midnight there was no sign of a copper anywhere.
Pounding the beat has long since slipped down the Met’s list of priorities.
These days they tend to respond to crime after the event, rather than seeking to prevent it.
That’s not to question the bravery of individual officers, as exemplified by the British Transport Police who tackled the Islamist nutjob who stabbed three people, including a police sergeant, at Manchester’s Victoria station this week.
But a visible police presence may have deterred the gang who killed Tudor Simionov.Sadiq Khan arrives for a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix Park, Dublin

No doubt London’s two-bob chancer of a Mayor Sadiq Khan would blame the absence of police on the streets on ‘austerity’ or the ‘Tory cuts’.
Maybe if he hadn’t splurged £2.3 million of taxpayers’ money on a vainglorious New Year fireworks display, he could have diverted more money to the Met to put extra bobbies on the beat.
Some of this largesse was frittered away turning the London Eye into a blue and yellow EU flag, as part of a cynical, self-serving propaganda stunt aimed at bolstering the Stop Brexit campaign and burnishing the image of the Mayor himself.
I wonder if Tudor Simionov was aware of Khan’s New Year message boasting that London would remain open after Brexit, broadcast in a number of foreign languages, including Romanian.
No one has ever suggested London won’t stay open when we leave the EU.
This was pure political posturing, at our expense.
The majority of Londoners may have backed Remain, but the really significant statistic is that more voted Leave (1.5 million) than voted for Khan (1.3 million).
What’s most likely to deter immigrants from coming here is not Khan slandering Leave voters as knuckle-scraping, racist bigots, but the news that someone can be stabbed to death on one of London’s busiest, best-known and most upmarket streets within two months of arriving in the country seeking a better future.
Under Khan, there has been an explosion of violent crime.
In addition to the New Year stabbings, a woman was shot in a nightclub in Hackney on the same night.
A day earlier, 39 people were arrested in Hammersmith on suspicion of attempted murder after another stabbing at a party.
We are all now familiar with the fact that last year London’s murder rate overtook New York.
There were 134 violent deaths in 2018, an increase of 15 per cent.
And if that chilling reality doesn’t put people off moving here from overseas, then perhaps they may be dissuaded by the paralysis on London’s roads and the exorbitant cost of housing — two key problems Khan has exacerbated, rather than solved
He promised 80,000 new homes a year, yet in the 12 months to last April built just over 5,300.
London’s economy may be steaming ahead (no thanks to Khan) but public services are deteriorating.The streets are dirtier, rubbish piles up uncollected late at night, public transport is horribly overcrowded and traffic is gridlocked as a deliberate consequence of the Mayor’s policies.
Rough sleepers and aggressive beggars are a permanent fixture in the West End.
Yet while innocent blood runs in the gutters, and police budgets are restrained, Khan indulges in fatuous propaganda stunts, whether floating a Donald Trump blimp over London or turning a traditional New Year’s party into a pro-EU festival of political hubris.
And instead of being able to celebrate an optimistic start to 2019, London’s evening paper has a splash headline marking the first stabbings of the year.
The first of many more to come, no doubt.
Makes you proud to be British.

Mueller concludes Russia-Trump probe; lawmakers urge immediate release
WASHINGTON: Special counsel Robert Mueller closed his long and contentious Russia investigation with no new charges Friday, ending the probe that has cast a dark shadow over Donald Trump’s presidency but launching a fresh wave of political battles over the still-confidential findings.
The report’s details remained a mystery, accessible to only a handful of Justice Department officials while Attorney General William Barr prepared to release the “principal findings” soon.
But the closure of the 22-month probe without additional indictments by Mueller was welcome news to some in Trump’s orbit who had feared a final round of charges could ensnare more Trump associates, including members of the president’s family.
The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.
Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.
The next step is up to Barr, who is charged with writing his own account of Mueller’s findings and sending it to Congress.
In a letter to lawmakers , he declared he was committed to transparency and speed.
He said he could provide details as soon as this weekend.
The White House sought to keep some distance from the report, saying it had not seen or been briefed on the document.
Trump, surrounded by advisers and political supporters at his resort in Florida, stayed uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter.
With no details released at this point, it’s not known whether Mueller’s report answers the core questions of his investigation: Did Trump’s campaign collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of the celebrity businessman?
Also, did Trump take steps later, including by firing his FBI director, to obstruct the probe?
But the delivery of the report does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, or of obstruction by the president.
A Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller was not recommending any further indictments.
That person, who described the document as “comprehensive,” was not authorized to discuss the probe and asked for anonymity.

That’s good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.
They include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller’s prosecutors.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mueller might have referred additional investigations to the Justice Department.
All told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies.
Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the Internet.
Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.
It’s unclear what steps Mueller might take if he uncovered what he believes to be criminal wrongdoing by Trump, in light of Justice Department legal opinions that have held that sitting presidents may not be indicted.
In his letter to lawmakers, Barr noted the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to ensure there was no political inference.
Trump was never interviewed in person, but submitted answers to questions in writing.
The mere delivery of the confidential findings set off swift, full-throated demands from Democrats for full release of Mueller’s report and the supporting evidence collected during the sweeping probe.
As Mueller’s probe has wound down, Democrats have increasingly shifted their focus to their own investigations, ensuring the special counsel’s would not be the last word on the matter.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it “imperative” to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.
“The American people have a right to the truth,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
Democrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a “sneak preview” of the findings.
“The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,” they said in a joint statement.
It was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller’s findings.
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying “we look forward to the process taking its course.” But Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get “an early look” before they were made public.
Giuliani said it was “appropriate” for the White House to be able “to review matters of executive privilege.” He said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.
He later softened his stance, saying the decision was “up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.”
The White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report’s arrival Friday.
Barr’s chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.

The chairman of the Senate panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was keynote speaker Friday night at a Palm Beach County GOP dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.
Early in the evening, the president appeared on a balcony to wave at the crowd of more than 600 enjoying cocktails and appetizers by the pool, according to party vice-chairwoman Tami Donnally, who attended the event.
Barr has said he wants to make as much public as possible, but any efforts to withhold details is sure to prompt a tussle between the Justice Department and lawmakers who may subpoena Mueller and his investigators to testify before Congress.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, threatened a subpoena Friday.
Such a move would likely be vigorously contested by the Trump administration.
The conclusion of Mueller’s investigation does not remove legal peril for the president .
Trump faces a separate Justice Department investigation in New York into hush money payments during the campaign to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election.
He’s also been implicated in a potential campaign finance violation by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the transactions.
Federal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions made to the president’s inaugural committee.
No matter the findings in Mueller’s report, the investigation has already illuminated Russia’s assault on the American political system, painted the Trump campaign as eager to exploit the release of hacked Democratic emails and exposed lies by Trump aides aimed at covering up their Russia-related contacts.
The special counsel brought a sweeping indictment accusing Russian military intelligence officers of hacking Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other Democratic groups during the 2016 campaign.
He charged another group of Russians with carrying out a large-scale social media disinformation campaign against the American political process that also sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.
Mueller also initiated the investigation into Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, who pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations arising from the hush money payments and in the Mueller probe to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal.
Another Trump confidant, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails ultimately released by WikiLeaks.
Mueller has also been investigating whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation.
Since the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017, Trump has increasingly tried to undermine the probe by calling it a “witch hunt” and repeatedly proclaiming there was “NO COLLUSION” with Russia.
But one week before Mueller’s appointment, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, later saying he was thinking of “this Russia thing” at the time.
