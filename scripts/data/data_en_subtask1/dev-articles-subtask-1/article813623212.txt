'Wishful thinking': Tory MPs dismiss May's hopes for change of heart on Brexit deal

Jeremy Hunt insisted Theresa May can still salvage her Brexit deal today - despite Tory MPs branding her hopes of getting it through Parliament 'wishful thinking'.
The Foreign Secretary said he believed the PM will 'find a way' to win the looming Commons vote by getting assurances with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop is only temporary.
But senior Conservatives said they were detecting no sign of a shift in opinion over the Christmas break, warning that 'nothing has changed'.
Brexit hostilities have been resumed with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.
The moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.
The premier used her New Year message to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'.
She said passing the deal would mean the UK can thrive and 'start a new chapter with optimism and hope'.
Mr Hunt added his voice to the pleas today, saying that the deal Mrs May had thrashed out with the EU can 'give us absolutely everything we wanted'.

Speaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.
'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.
'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.
'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.
'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'
Mr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.
'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.
'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.
'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'
He also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.
Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.
Mrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.
But the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.
The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.
However, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.
Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.
Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.
And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.
Corbyn at odds with Labour activists over Brexit referendum Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.
The Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.
But a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.
There was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.
The work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.
Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.
Mr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.
Speaking at a rail fares protest in London, he said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.
'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.
'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.
'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'
Sir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.
'Parliament exists to make our laws.
This Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'
Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.
'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.
'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.
They would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'
Another senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'
They added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...
'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'
Mr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.
He said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.
'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.
'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'
Mr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.
